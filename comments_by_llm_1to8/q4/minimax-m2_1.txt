  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—survival, then understanding, then pursuit—is signaled and evolves, but escalation is largely reflective rather than event-driven. No on-page reversal tightens options; the frost discovery arrives without resistance or cost, and Mira's turn to pursuer in the final paragraph is a declared stance rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative. Coincidence (frost patterns conveniently mirror the ledger) complicates but also resolves the knowledge gap. One deepening is present (survival → pursuit) but lacks visible price or tactical alteration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translate silence into music via heat-mapping—is signaled early and persists. Elara's approach to the avoided performance hall constitutes one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens: intensity increases when "the air pulsed with warmth in waves" and her sensor trembles. Yet the resolution is a declarative realization ("she had succeeded") rather than a decision or tactic shift that narrows options with dramatized cost. No on-page reversal forces a choice between competing goods or forecloses a path; the ending awards success without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—helping lost souls find rest—is signaled by the distress-signal framing and Aldric's profession. Pressure coheres: he recognizes the need, engages with each soul individually, and the work restores his own sense of purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade, replaced by something that felt almost like purpose restored." The cost is implied (he now bears this impossible responsibility permanently) but lacks a visible on-page price at the closure beat—no forfeited option or trade-off is dramatized in the final paragraph, only the calm acceptance of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—community survival and hope under sanctions—is signaled early and remains coherent. The midnight deliveries and the bell-ringing provide a meaningful tightening that shifts from anonymous individual aid to public collective declaration. However, the escalation lacks sharp friction or competing cost on the page; Mira's decision to ring the bell encounters no visible resistance, no trade-off between secrecy and exposure, no dramatized risk. The turn reads as accumulation rather than a choice that narrows options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—healing unused love stored in place—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is minimal: Mei arrives, senses the tendrils, and executes the photographing without meaningful resistance, reversal, or cost. Her breathing changes reveal the answer rather than forcing a difficult trade-off. The resolution feels preordained by memory and artifact rather than earned through protagonist agency that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, the density does deepen, but the lack of a visible price or foreclosed path keeps the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—stopping the photographs' disintegration by completing her grandfather's temporal experiment—is signaled early and tightens as Elara discovers the halo fragment's function. The piece deepens through accumulation of understanding: photographs showing future images, the garden's hyperbolic geometry, the temporal anchor failing. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than pressurized choice; Elara encounters no resistance, competing impulse, or trade-off. The final act is intention ("she began to draw") without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is preservation and future planting; the wall's fall provides the timeframe pressure. The deepening occurs when Mira shifts from vault-keeper to active planter ("Then, in the quiet aftermath, she would carry these seeds out one by one"). That tightening narrows her options—she must wait for soldiers, then act—and the cost is patience and risk. No reversal, but the accumulative lens allows a single meaningful reweighting. Agency reads as strategic endurance rather than immediate decision, which fits the "patiently strategic" element but limits felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and frames Elara's work. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the "breakthrough" arrives as internal realization without a trade-off or visible cost that alters tactics. The forge and synesthesia complicate the method, but coincidence (currents, the forge's properties) enables rather than tests agency, and the ending lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mira's dominant stake—to capture "illuminated moments" and reveal "paths untraveled"—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, resource scarcity, or internal conflict tightens her options; she executes her ritual without hindrance. The man's slight expression change is observed, not earned by Mira's agency, and does not rebound to force a trade-off or foreclose a path. The final paragraph summarizes her philosophy rather than dramatizing a choice with visible cost, leaving escalation minimal under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—internal thawing and vulnerability—is signaled early but remains abstract. The glass-working sequence (retrieve gather, reheat in glory hole, shape vessel) provides procedural beats but no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The protagonist's agency is observation and craft execution without a trade-off or price that forecloses a path. The ending ("prepared to begin again") asserts cyclical readiness rather than a turn driven by prior causality. No escalation under the Accumulative lens beyond density of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming identity) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Daniel advances and Maya realizes his betrayal, but the turn is told rather than shown through contested action. The final beat lacks agency: Maya traces smudged notes and "pattern emerged"—passive discovery—then stands and speaks while Daniel's eyes widen. No on-page reversal alters tactics; coincidence (the cast happened to be on the table) supplies the solution. The cost is declared ("trembling certainty") but not demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price paid in the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—completing the map before darkness claims the world—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights cost; instead the oracle moves smoothly from vigil to drawing without opposition or trade-off. The storm's pause removes external pressure at the key beat. No on-page reversal, tightening, or visible price paid (time, stamina, social credit) alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—where do thoughts come from—is signaled in paragraph three and drives the robot's return to the courtyard. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the realization that "the answer lies not in finding a source but in accepting the flow." Under the accumulative lens, this reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the search itself must be renounced). The stakes remain philosophical rather than dramatized through a forced trade-off or visible forfeiture of a concrete resource.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: thawing mistrust through transparency. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira places her hand over the narrator's—a reversal that shifts the conflict from isolated waiting to mutual risk, narrowing options (the narrator can no longer defer engagement). The hand-touch operates as agency through attention and endurance: months of solitary work foreclose the path of passive observation, forcing active participation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the escalating series: ticket exchange, mirror-drawing response, physical contact, arrival of new visitors. However, the cost at closure remains primarily conceptual (lens "suddenly heavier") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off that alters immediate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's dedication to the garden and its memory—is signaled early but remains static. The villager's arrival at the end is a potential complication, yet Elara declines to engage, deflating pressure. The mended deception is recounted as resolved backstory rather than an on-page tightening. No reversal or deepening forecloses options with cost; the piece accumulates texture but does not escalate under its Accumulative lens. One meaningful pressure point is required at this length, and the text offers reflection rather than a choice that narrows tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (proving sideways time) is signaled early and pressure accumulates as the nexus warms, but no reversal or tightening forces Kira to trade one good against another. She proceeds from hypothesis to lever-pull to confirmation without a moment when success becomes uncertain or costly. ARIA's "Unprecedented readings" declares victory rather than dramatizing a price paid. The velith-wings' dual molt phases offer visual proof, yet Kira's personal or professional cost remains off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: decode Marco's hidden message. The program's water-damage revelation provides one meaningful deepening that narrows her path to the piano. However, escalation occurs through discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure—she waits, the flood reveals, she plays. No visible trade-off or tactical constraint shapes her approach; the cost of staying versus leaving is declared but never tested in a choice that forecloses an option. The closure reconfigures meaning but does not demonstrate a price paid for this stance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can issue a warning despite her guilt over Elena's death—is signaled early and tightens when the console shows pressure dropping and she hesitates at the controls. The touch of the smudge is the pivot that narrows options: she can no longer hide behind her terror. The storm's arrival provides external escalation that converges with her internal shift. The cost is legible: she "swallows" terror and truth together, foreclosing her paralysis. One reversal (fever breaks → she can act; she touches the smudge → she can forgive) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to release a swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through the ghost shift sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the radio voices multiply and Marcus recognizes his own burden mirrored in them, narrowing his options to speak. Agency is present in the final act (he places his hand and speaks), though the earlier moves feel more observational than volitional. The cost is legible: he speaks something he has never voiced, foreclosing his prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.9)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. The keeper's motivation "to witness change without judgment" is label-only and never faces a concrete test or trade-off. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the piece loops between library and refuge without escalation. Agency is absent: the keeper observes, does not decide, and the ending restates the opening without cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—nurturing wonder in the children—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains largely static rather than escalating. The eclipse provides atmospheric intensification, yet no complication forces Elara to adapt tactics or face a trade-off; Maya's touch is a gentle affirmation rather than a reversal. The session unfolds as planned without a meaningful narrowing of options or a felt cost, keeping the piece in mid-band for conflict despite its thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why dreams ended and what that loss means—is signaled early and drives Elias's research. One meaningful deepening occurs: Miriam's entries reveal that dragons failed and dreams were "drained to seal the breach," shifting Elias from passive archivist to someone who believes stories might restore wonder. The tightening is conceptual rather than situational, fitting the Accumulative lens, and "renewed urgency" alters his posture. Cost is legible in the final image: the world "had been displaced, but it had not been destroyed," accepting permanent loss while finding a sliver of hope. Agency is present in his decision to continue, though no high-stakes external antagonist appears.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transposing life into a new key versus the pull of the old world—is signaled early and sustained. The letter from the old world provides a clear tightening, and Elias's choice to seal it with paste without reading offers a renunciation move. However, this choice happens off-page emotionally (we don't see the struggle or cost in real time), and the arrivals at dusk feel coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The orchestration framework allows him to step back, but that meta-move weakens the felt price at closure. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the final beat's cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—completing or preventing Gabriel's possession through interrogation—is signaled early and remains coherent. The midnight deadline and escalating chant layers provide tightening pressure under the Accumulative lens. Gabriel's scream ("frustration...caught between arrivals") deepens the stalled possession premise. However, no on-page reversal or choice narrows options with visible cost; Matthias's walk toward the vestry is movement toward confrontation, not a decisive act that forecloses a path or reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—write one final prophecy before exhaustion/fragmentation—is signaled early. Yet no on-page escalation occurs: Elira maps memories and writes the fortune in a smooth, uninterrupted sequence with no reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost that alters tactics. The council's urgency and the dawn deadline remain external pressures never tested by a pivot or sacrifice. Agency is absent; the protagonist completes the assigned task without renunciation or endurance that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—integrating fractured selves by retracing timelines—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure is conceptual rather than escalatory: Mira moves through memory and metaphor but faces no on-page reversal, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The tablet "generates her routes" and she "lets the procedural generation carry her," rendering her passive; agency is declared in the final beat ("this time, she would be the one") without prior dramatization of refusal, renunciation, or a difficult pivot. No visible cost (stamina, lost knowledge, forfeited option) alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled immediately and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through each backward recording, narrowing Maren's stance from passive endurance to active navigation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers "numbness was not a wall but a door." Weakness: no visible cost or trade-off dramatized on the page; her transformation feels frictionless, and the final coda's future tense ("would become") tells us stakes will continue rather than showing a present forfeiture or hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing corruption vs. personal safety—is signaled early and tightens when Elena realizes her data incriminates the ministry. One meaningful escalation: the shift from passive documentation to active whistleblowing. The cost of sending evidence is stated ("she had done something more important") but not dramatized with visible sacrifice—no shown trade-off of safety, relationships, or resources. The followers who create external pressure vanish after paragraph two without complicating her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to document transformation or join it. The tension is declared early but never tightened through a choice that narrows options—Mira circles the question across multiple paragraphs without a reversal or escalating pressure that forces a trade-off. The ending opts for perpetual liminality rather than an earned decision with visible cost, leaving the stake acknowledged but unresolved in a way that feels static rather than deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to interrupt the chronic hush and release what the fire trapped. The tightening occurs when the first note "pushes out into the hush like a hand reaching from a well" and the echo answers, then accumulates as the bowl vibrates. Cost is visible—playing for what "could not be unburned" and accepting the devastation as "woven through" the beauty. Agency is decision and action: she raises the violin, plays, and carries the bowl forward. One meaningful pressure point sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: will the compound work, and will Vera risk genuine feeling to validate it? The transformation beat deepens pressure—she must experience what she designed for others—and her decision to inhale represents agency with risk. The grief "subsumed her gently" and she "exhaled slowly, releasing" it, which closes the cycle, but no live alternative is visibly foreclosed; she returns to "the work was never finished, only suspended." Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification suffices, and the cost is conceptual (accepting her method's moral ambiguity), placing this in the 7–8 range but shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will act on the misplaced letter—is signaled early and resolved when she seeks out Elias. The encounter deepens understanding (both share stories of invisible workers) and yields a gift exchange, but no option is foreclosed and no trade-off tested. Pressure remains steady rather than escalating: the envelope is an invitation, not a dilemma. Under the Accumulative lens, the thematic density increases through the conversation, yet the ending's "cautious exuberance" and planning for future acts suggest possibility rather than a tightening that narrows Maren's world. One meaningful deepening occurs (shared recognition of silent labor), meeting the length threshold, but visible cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Yara seeks "a place where her sympathy could root instead of drain." One meaningful tightening occurs when Corwin warns "no one goes alone the first time" and the arbor "shows you what you're seeking, but only if you approach it honestly," raising the cost of her search from external discovery to internal reckoning. The arbor scene forces a trade-off—she must renounce her identity as unilateral giver to access reciprocal kinship—with legible cost in "ask for help, not only offer it." However, the resolution reads more as realization than a high-pressure choice that forecloses competing live options in the moment; the decision to stay crystallizes smoothly without visible friction or a dramatized refusal of an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring the city's stolen rhythm—is signaled early and remains coherent. The journey tightens options (canals grow narrower/darker, interrupted cadence grows stronger), producing one meaningful escalation under an Accumulative lens. However, the climax lacks visible cost or trade-off: Sera "carefully, deliberately" performs the uncaging without dramatized risk, failure, or sacrifice. The resolution is smooth rather than hard-won, and no on-page consequence alters her state or tactics. Band entry at ~6.6 reflects the single tightening with conceptual rather than felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding/resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled early but remains abstract. No clear options narrow on the page: she arrives intending to "solve" her loss and leaves having "dovetailed with it," yet what she renounces or gains in capability is unclear. The glass-eyes moment offers a perceptual shift but not a trade-off with legible cost. One deepening occurs (blur-to-question via the eyes), but pressure does not tighten through protagonist agency so much as through lyric meditation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake with cost; here the final paragraph asserts the shift rather than demonstrating it through a visible forfeiture or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Maren's desire to be visible through transmission—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or tightening. The outage grants "unusual freedom" rather than restricting options, and the tape fragment discovery is serendipitous rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. No reversal or complication narrows her path; the cascade of sense memory delivers understanding without friction, and the student's success occurs off-page as narrative gift. The resolution lacks visible cost: Maren's "purpose fulfilled" reads as satisfaction without trade-off or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Vera's resistance to change vs. progressive illness and family distance) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the grant acceptance forces her to confront whether her life's work has been evasion rather than study. The phone call is a stakes-raising choice that forecloses her evasive pattern with felt cost (admitting she doesn't understand transformation). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though a second micro-turn in the middle third would have sharpened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira's search for an unnamed object/meaning—is signaled early but remains abstract until the telescope appears. The exchange itself is frictionless: the stranger offers the scope freely, Mira accepts, and no live option is foreclosed on the page. The nineteen-day insomnia raises urgency, but no on-page reversal tests Mira's commitment or forces a visible trade-off between competing needs.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is Varen's need to understand why the cave called him and what purpose his visions serve—signaled early when he tries to see the pearls' future. The first tightening occurs when the pearls reflect only his face, cracking his certainty. Pressure accumulates through the cave's teaching until the nine-day inhabitation deepens his relationship to time and seeing. The resolution is earned by his receptivity to the cave's lesson (agency as attention/endurance). The cost is conceptual but legible: his visions are "made small against the vast, ongoing miracle of what was happening now," a reweighting that forecloses his prior mastery-stance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why he kept the valve and what role he will play after exile—is clear and present throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vision rises "not from someone else's fragment, but from the object itself," tightening his connection to the returning community. However, the archivist encounters no genuine opposition or complication; Sera's arrival facilitates rather than tests him. The resolution grants understanding without requiring trade-off, renunciation, or visible cost that alters his tactics or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake: find the fortress of unspoken truths, signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the mist and arrow-cracks, but Aria's agency is passive—she follows rather than chooses under conflicting options. The confession at the station is a deepening, but it arrives without visible trade-off or foreclosed path; speaking aloud costs nothing tactically. The dare from the mentor is setup-only; no on-page antagonist or complication tests her commitment. One meaningful tightening (arrival at station → confession) meets the length standard, but cost legibility is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's internal conflict between skepticism and wonder—is signaled early and tightens through the transcription scene. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the tile holds generational memories, which reweights her purpose from documentation to participation. Agency is present in her choice to transcribe and press her palm, though the whale migration itself provides coincidental timing rather than direct obstacle. The cost is felt ("skepticism remained...but it had found a companion") but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what lies beyond ending—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the storm's escalation and amulet warming, providing one meaningful deepening. However, Elian remains passive observer; the amulet "reveals" rather than Elian choosing to act with cost. No options are narrowed or traded off on the page; the resolution arrives via external event (storm peak) rather than protagonist agency that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elena's search for the "mathematics of a fair trade" between exploitation and help. The tightening occurs when Darius arrives and she sees the asylum application, but the escalation is more conceptual than causal—her decision to write the application is recounted rather than shown through on-page attempts, friction, or tactical adjustments. The approval arrives off-page in summary ("Three weeks later"), eliding the cost of waiting or the risk of failure. The ink pot's role in "revealing truth" feels asserted rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing the town's lost history via frequency-mapping—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no escalation or tightening occurs: today's hum-shift is recorded exactly as prior shifts were, with no complication, reversal, or cost. The piece describes Elara's ongoing practice without a single moment where her agency narrows options or forecloses a path. Pressure does not accumulate toward the ending; the final line restates her patience rather than testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding erased histories through fragment collection—is signaled early but remains static. The label discovery is a deepening (reweighting the woman's story from failure to choice), yet no live option is foreclosed and no tactical shift occurs. The woman's departure into ship holds is recounted, not dramatized, so the cost of her choice is told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: Elena's need to explain versus her unacknowledged longing for connection. The inciting turn (cello hum reveals a vision) arrives clearly and narrows her options from detached investigation to personal reckoning. However, escalation is largely reflective—she "began to retell" and "pieced together fragments"—rather than a sequence of on-page decisions with visible trade-offs. The final acceptance of mystery is a stance crystallization, but the cost (forfeiting her debunking mission) is told rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or renunciation scene. One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens, but pressure doesn't visibly narrow options in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting community from displacement—is clear early. Mira's tactic (resurrecting the graffiti cipher) is purposeful but never meets on-page resistance or complication. The investors tour but don't interact; no reversal forces her to adapt. The escalation is textural (more symbols painted, more reach implied) rather than causal pressure that narrows her options. The ending asserts readiness without showing a trade-off: what did she forfeit, miss, or risk by working alone through the night?

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—photographing vanishing frost before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens through the forty-minute window. The chronometer and dawning light provide escalating pressure. However, no reversal or obstacle tests her commitment; she executes her plan without friction, and the "cost" (acknowledging loss) is thematic contemplation rather than a trade-off that alters tactics or forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—repair the drone before the ship departs—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elias encounters "extensive" damage, yet the fix proceeds smoothly with "practiced efficiency" and no setbacks, trade-offs, or visible cost. The time pressure (dawn departure) never tightens on the page; we're told "the ship's anchor was lifting" but feel no race against the clock. The resolution is delivered to Elias rather than earned through a difficult choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the convergence exists—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through interpretive tightening (leaf, symbol, phrasebook match) rather than reversal. The story deepens Miriam's confidence but does not dramatize a choice that narrows options or forecloses a live alternative on the page. The final beat crystallizes readiness rather than paying a visible cost; escalation is gentle and intellectual, fitting the Accumulative lens, but stakes remain prospective.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—revive Vellachen to heal the wider network of towns—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the repetition of her walking and the slowly emerging hum, consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is muted: no meaningful reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; she begins the story walking and ends still walking with the same conviction. The stated "seven thousand repetitions" and "perhaps two thousand footsteps left" imply a future climax rather than an on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete the family task or die without finishing. Pressure tightens as oxygen fails ("remaining air bubbled past her lips in a desperate exhalation") and the distress signal brings no help. Opening the vial is an agency-driven escalation that forecloses retreat. The mechanism behind the altar and the temple's recognition narrow options toward the transformation. The cost—surrendering "singular existence" to become the vessel—is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (vial opened, gears unsnarled) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though the shift from drowning to transcendent breathing bypasses physical struggle and slightly undercuts visceral escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marcus seeks to "inherit story instead" of silence and vindicate his father's disbelieved truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when he steps into the chamber and speaks the words aloud, narrowing his path to witness and testimony. However, the escalation is muted—no on-page antagonist resists him, and the bodies' discovery is deferred off-page, weakening the immediate cost. Agency is present (he arranged his own incarceration, he speaks the truth), but the peak choice feels more symbolic than visceral, and the price paid is reputational or abstract rather than dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Elara's debt repayment, signaled early ("the debt had begun three hundred winters ago"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the scions burst forth with healthy growth and Elara solidifies to transfer the blessing/curse to the gardener, narrowing her path toward freedom. Agency is decision and renunciation: Elara chooses to pass the work, and the gardener accepts it (albeit involuntarily, which slightly undercuts protagonist-driven escalation). The cost is legible—Elara moves closer to release, the gardener inherits the burden—but the gardener's consent is absent, which weakens the earned-reversal requirement. The final image reweights options (Elara's approaching freedom, the gardener's new responsibility) under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming the broken labyrinth into a navigable, life-sustaining space—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the nightly processions and the discovery that her sewn paths glow, constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation lacks a visible tightening or trade-off: Maren encounters no resistance, makes no difficult choice between competing goods, and pays no dramatized cost at the spring. The canyon "accepts her gifts in silence" without complication. Agency is present (she sews, she reaches the spring, she completes the work) but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her grandmother never spoke of home yet wept at apple blooms—is signaled early and drives the excavation choice. The birthmark discovery tightens pressure meaningfully, narrowing Mira's options from scholar-observer to custodian-witness. However, the piece lacks a moment where this new role costs her something concrete on the page (e.g., a forfeited flight, a professional credential, a relationship). The final placement of the sundial reconfigures her stance, but the price reads more as acceptance than visible sacrifice. One clear escalation through protagonist agency; cost is felt but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—crafting Eleanor's pseudonym and adding the postscript—is signaled early. The postscript addition is a micro-choice, but it arrives without visible opposition or cost; Maren simply decides the letter "needed one more thing" and writes it. No escalation or tightening narrows options; the letter progresses smoothly from draft to completion without complication. Agency is present in the decision to add the postscript, but the lack of resistance or visible price keeps pressure low.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: expose the conspiracy before the coup. No on-page tightening or deepening occurs; Elara adds another thread to her chart but faces no reversal, no narrowed option, no visible trade-off. The conspirators finalize plans off-stage; coincidence delivers information (servants overhear) without protagonist agency driving escalation. The ending asserts that her work will outlast the conspirators but provides no scene where a choice forecloses a live alternative with felt cost. Pressure remains static rather than cohering toward a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren must confront the unsent apology and seventeen years of self-punishment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spirits offer her the "impossible chance" and the window shifts from command to self-forgiveness, narrowing her options to acceptance or continued flight. The final act—holding both versions of herself—forecloses the path of endless guilt with on-page emotional cost. Deduction: the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven reversals; the window's messages feel partly exterior to her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: translating Fatima's trauma into testimony. The request from Dr. Okonkwo initiates movement, and Elira's decoding reweights the grandmother's grief, but no live option narrows or trades off on the page. The child's touch and smudged notes deepen meaning, yet Elira never encounters friction—no rival interpretation, no cost to speaking the truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a visible tightening that forecloses a path. One deepening is present, sufficient for band entry, but the felt price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering joy after "three years of painting corporate lobbies"—is signaled early and drives the projection scene. One meaningful tightening: Mira's laugh with its pensive edge acknowledges that joy "could end," a visible emotional trade-off. The children's imitation and the old woman's touch deepen pressure without requiring multiple reversals. The fresco's darkening is a legible cost that forecloses repeating this act. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices for strong escalation at 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elena's certainty about restoration versus the garden's mystery—is signaled early and tightens once (nickel discovery shifts her approach). However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on atmospheric intensification ("echoes seemed to pool," "mural was beginning to answer") rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The ending crystallizes her stance but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but pressure does not visibly force a decision with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—planting the seed to resist cognitive taxation—is signaled but never tested. The drone's scan is the only opposition and it resolves instantly when Maren smiles and mentions cabbage. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Maren's plan proceeds exactly as intended from start to finish. The story lacks the "one meaningful tightening" required for this length, presenting installation rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—sustaining creative output and hope across immense longing—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates texturally: the weight of centuries, the stretching of longing like taffy, the fear of snapping. However, there is no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or moment where options narrow with visible cost. The poet does not decide, renounce, or alter tactics; she simply persists. Under an Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the intensification (writing faster, poems becoming tendrils) reads as assertion rather than dramatized escalation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.9)
    No dominant stake is dramatized. The caretaker's work—lifting the wind chime to display cases, collecting names into memory—proceeds without opposition, cost, or complication. "Foxglove regret" is asserted as a feeling but never forces a trade-off or reveals competing values. The piece cycles through description and summary ("she worked through the night, as she always did") with no on-page tightening, deepening, or choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust with Elian by completing their shared work—is signaled early and drives the climax. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara uncorks the ink well and begins writing, narrowing her options and committing to the final interpretation with visible cost (years of trust risked on "one false interpretation"). The resolution is earned by her eleven-year effort and the on-page act of translation. However, Elian's arrival immediately after she finishes feels convenient rather than causally compelled, and no secondary pressure complicates her decision in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding her father's disappearance and continuing his work—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the adhesive and realizes he vanished to protect her, narrowing her understanding. However, the final commitment to "continue" lacks on-page agency with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The volcano's trembling offers external pressure but does not force a choice between competing goods or require renunciation. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is more thematic reconfiguration than escalation that alters tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost songs to learn trust again—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Eleanor connects dust-mote mathematics to sonic reconstruction, narrowing her method and emotional trajectory. The final act (playing the recording) is protagonist-driven, but the escalation unfolds through patient process rather than reversals that force trade-offs. Cost is present ("remain open… against evidence") yet feels conceptual rather than a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding her mother—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara observes, intuits, and then steps toward the village without facing a trade-off or obstacle that narrows options. The "sacred threshold" is declared rather than tested: no moment forces her to choose between competing goods or costs. The Accumulative lens allows pressure to build through reflection, but the final step feels unopposed, and the reunion occurs without visible sacrifice or transformation that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early through the grandmother's question. Pressure accumulates through the archive discovery and the note's revelation, leading to the firefly emergence that reweights Marek's understanding. However, escalation is driven by observation and patience rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off; Marek waits and the fireflies come "as they always had." The tightening is a deepening of perception, not a narrowing of options or a cost-bearing choice. No reversal or renunciation forecloses a path; the ending grants understanding without dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the son's fate—is signaled early and drives Maren's effort. One meaningful tightening occurs when she encounters the gaps ("places where the thread simply stopped") and must push deeper, narrowing her interpretive options. The resolution depends on Maren's professional agency (choosing to follow emotional trails rather than physical ones), and the cost is visible: she delivers an answer that brings "not closure but continuation," a trade-off the fisher accepts through tears. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the final image reweights the father's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—navigating the arcade's liminal space to create wonder through orchestrated chance—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Marek performs as planned, the couple smiles, the crowd gathers, and he pockets the bishop without any meaningful tightening, reversal, or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or cadence shift; instead, the piece loops ("each journey different yet somehow the same") without a turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Agency remains assertion rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—penning the cosmic verse—is signaled early but unfolds without opposition or cost. The tide dancer kneels, breathes on the speck, presses fingers to skin, and the verse "writes itself"; no tightening or trade-off occurs. The nostalgic exile and the human woman's waiting generate no friction. The ending reframes exile as arrival, but this shift is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; the text offers thematic echo instead.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding clarity before the workday—is signaled early but remains abstract. The stone-throwing ritual deepens understanding without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No reversal or tightening choice alters tactics; the boat engine starting is coincidental pressure, and the protagonist simply turns toward work. The cost of her "particular patience" is told but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring the bargain with loss and translating survival into mentorship—is signaled early and carried through. Yet the piece is essentially a memorial ritual without live opposition or a meaningful tightening tonight; Mira arrives resolved and departs reaffirmed. The only pressure is internal reflection deepening her prior stance. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification suffices, but here the cost (returning to the station tomorrow) is preordained rather than forged on-page, keeping escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding hope's dynamics—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No escalation, reversal, or tightening occurs; Elara's methodology remains unchanged from opening to close, and her "serene upheaval" produces no visible friction, sacrifice, or trade-off. The narrative summarizes her research process without dramatizing a single trial that fails, succeeds differently than expected, or forces a tactical adjustment. Agency is absent: she observes and theorizes but makes no decision that forecloses a path or changes her situation with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—chart the building's dreams before they dissolve—is signaled early and sustained through Mira's methodical work. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers Ashworth's incomplete echo chart, connecting her solitary labor to a predecessor's parallel effort. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or tactical narrowing; Mira encounters no resistance, competing urgency, or renunciation that tests her commitment. The resolution feels meditative rather than pressured, with agency expressed through continuation rather than a forced choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early but never faces opposition or complication. Aria encounters no resistance, no failed attempt, no cost that alters her tactics. The "hush before bells ring" timeframe promises urgency but delivers none; her ritual proceeds exactly as intended from hum to completion. The piece offers atmospheric progression without escalation. No reversal, no tightening of options, no trade-off that forecloses a path. Under Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break; instead the ending simply declares success and moves to the next villa.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—forging trust between factions—is signaled early, and pressure coheres through the assembly and name-reading. Yet the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal: Varen and Sera arrive ready for reparations, Maren reads names, they soften and shake hands in a single move without intermediate resistance or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the handshake "lingers a beat too long" but does not dramatize what either party sacrifices or what specific path is now closed. Under Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is needed; here the gentleness remains constant without a spike that reweights tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of an extinct species—is clear and signaled early, but all pressure is retrospective (manufactured drought, diverted rivers, years of work). On the page, the protagonist executes a rehearsed plan with no reversal, complication, or tightening that forces a trade-off. Thunder returns as a time cue but does not alter her action. The "fractured grace" of her undertaking is asserted rather than tested. Agency reads as completion of a prior design, not a choice under fire that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—remaining awake against the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early but never tested by on-page pressure. No antagonist appears, no choice between competing goods materializes, and the protagonist's untangling work proceeds without reversal or complication. The resolution claims she "had proven something to herself tonight," but the text shows no moment where that proof was at risk or cost was paid. Escalation is absent; the work proceeds smoothly from kneel to rise without a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—signals early and tightens through the reverse-telling experiment, which narrows Elias's options by revealing his complicity. The argument with Mira off-stage weakens immediacy; her challenge arrives as summary rather than scene pressure. One meaningful deepening (the reversal experiment changes his understanding) suffices under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: he relinquishes narrative conquest, leaving threads dangling. Agency is clear in his choice to plant the stick and walk away.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch's passage through signal structures—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The wind gust at midpoint provides a meaningful tightening that forces Elara to improvise a rescue signal, narrowing her options from preservation to intervention. The seventeen-minute rest delivers a visible success, though the cost (the grotto "might not exist next year") feels more thematic than tactically forfeited. Agency is present in the improvisation, and the Accumulative lens supports the ending's reweighting of transience, but the escalation stops short of forcing a trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve forgotten names and finish unfinished work. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the rope glows and names rise through the night. One meaningful deepening occurs: the rope hums with memory by dawn, and Yara's decision to walk toward the door forecloses isolation. Cost is visible (aching joints, five winters, numb fingers). Small gap: the escalation is textural density rather than a sharp reversal, which fits the lens but lands gently; a more visceral price at the threshold would tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching "the threshold between walking and being walked"—is declared but never tested by on-page reversal or tightening choice. Foresight performs a ritual without obstacle or trade-off; the storm approaches but imposes no tactical cost, and the "decaying directive" fades passively rather than forcing adaptation. The "transcended" line asserts resolution without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid, leaving escalation abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (restore the forgotten covenant to preserve the city's prosperity) is signaled by mid-story. The discovery of the encrypted message provides one meaningful tightening: Maruk learns the covenant was real and abandoned through oversight. However, the climax lacks on-page opposition or cost—no resource scarcity, no rival claim to the observatory, no risk of failure in the ritual itself. The new regime's arrival at dawn creates a time window but never tests Maruk's commitment; he completes the ritual unopposed and continues his work unchanged, which reads as deepening knowledge without a turn that narrows his options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—convince Kael to release resentment—is signaled early but escalates through exposition rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The shifting intensifies around them, yet neither character's choices narrow options or force trade-offs; Kael simply closes his eyes and the world responds. No visible price is paid: the pin "gleamed as grace settled" without sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. The tightening is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—recreating the astronomer's lost dream through mirror-making—is signaled early and remains legible. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Mira encounters no meaningful resistance, technical failure, or deepening difficulty. The synchronized breathing method succeeds on first attempt, and the mirror simply works. No credible loss or trade-off shapes tactics; the astronomer's death and the woman's request apply no pressure that Mira must navigate. The final image suggests success without visible cost, reading more as confirmation than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: repair the statue and, implicitly, the fractured relationship with her daughter. The work itself provides one meaningful tightening (fitting shard to shard, the grinding wheel's precision) that narrows options and demonstrates commitment. The daughter's arrival provides a second pressure point, crystallizing the reunion. Cost is visible: months of persistence, the physical evidence of failure she carries. Under the Accumulative lens, the intensification reads as a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The epiphany ("some promises could not be mended with tools alone") is told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the inheritance and asking "the right question"—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira moves from passive receipt of the cameo to active inquiry in the bathroom, and the question "when the first page meets the last" tightens focus. However, no live option is foreclosed; she faces no trade-off or visible cost in asking. The escalation is primarily internal and reflective rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure—she sits, reflects, and speaks, but no decision alters her tactics or forfeits a path. The "brightened disquiet" and the cameo's glow feel like rewards, not prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (renegotiate the failed bargain to recover lost wisdom) is signaled, but Elara's escalation consists of summary transit and realization rather than on-page choices that narrow options. The time traveler's failed negotiation is recounted, not witnessed; Elara's counter-proposal is described in principle ("translating specimens into a vocabulary of loss") without a concrete scene where cost or trade-off materializes. No reversal or tightening choice forecloses a live path with visible price. Pressure remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recapturing something memories cannot hold—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates density (card intensifies, fog thins, brother's voice clarifies) but lacks a discrete on-page tightening or decision that narrows options before the final step. The step forward reads as acceptance of an open-ended quest rather than a choice with visible trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than embodied in a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—solving the architectural mystery—is signaled early and remains coherent. The story delivers one tightening when Elena decodes the rope pattern, but the resolution lacks on-page cost or trade-off. No option is foreclosed; no price is paid. The tension operates smoothly but never forces a sacrifice or renunciation, keeping escalation functional but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find a bloom of hush as refuge from the energy beings' unceasing bombardment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spiral pattern is recognized as formation rather than damage, narrowing the search to a specific method (pressing stone, producing tone). The cost is legible—months of accumulated frequency, survivors suffering—and Mira's agency (choosing to breach the shrine's sanctity, producing the mapkeeper tone) drives the bloom's emergence. The resolution feels more discovery than trade-off, slightly softening the escalation's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling connection via the shard of hush—is signaled in paragraph three but never tested by on-page obstacle or competing pressure. The prism discovery is passive (lying in debris) rather than fought-for, and the decision to climb is stated as future intention without dramatized execution or complication. No reversal tightens options; Elara moves from custodianship to hope without visible cost, trade-off, or foreclosed path. The pavilion "vibrating in approval" and the universe "refusing to abandon its children" suggest external validation rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Coincidence functions decoratively (the prism's placement) rather than as a constraint that Elara must work against or through.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and recording collective memory—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged. The archivist moves through her ritual without encountering opposition, time pressure, or a dilemma that forces a tradeoff. The storm intensifies and quiets, but this external shift does not tighten her options or compel a decision with visible cost. One monument "spoke of grief remembered accurately," but this observation does not escalate into a reversal or deepening that narrows tactics. Agency is limited to continued observation and writing; no renunciation or endurance forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—pierce the darkness and remind people hope is possible—is signaled early and coheres through preparation beats. The mosaic note provides one meaningful tightening: Mira's wandering becomes purposeful invitation. The final lighting is protagonist-driven, forecloses her option to remain passive, and generates a visible cost (exposure, commitment to her role). However, the opposition is primarily atmospheric (starless sky, quiet villages) rather than an antagonist or dilemma that tests her values, and the villages' immediate response ("doors opening, footsteps approaching") arrives too quickly to fully demonstrate earned escalation or felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding connection after three years of silence—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Mira chooses to stay present despite discomfort, then places the cicada between them, a micro-reversal that shifts the sister's tone. The cost is relational: risking further rejection, exposing vulnerability. Agency is present in Mira's choice to offer rather than retreat, though the sister's agency remains minimal. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; the final beat reweights their relational options.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to escape claustrophobic limitation and collect a new silence—is signaled early and sustained. The gravity countdown provides urgency, and the sprouting plant offers a thematic intensification ("by limiting exposure to fear, things could finally grow"). However, the peak turn is cognitive and declared ("she understood now") rather than enacted through a choice that narrows options or costs her something tangible on the page. The resolution (she will return to the bunker but carry the hush, maybe build differently someday) defers consequence rather than paying it in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: soothe the boy's nightmare. Maren extends the route and deploys her skillset, but there is no reversal, trade-off, or meaningful tightening—each step succeeds as executed. The storm glass signals distress and then clears in direct response to her actions without resistance. No cost is visible; the boy will not remember, but this is framed as gift rather than loss. Pressure remains static rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens; density increases but does not force a harder choice or alter Maren's options.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—proving worthy of the Unclaimed Throne—is signaled early. However, escalation is procedural: Elara decodes symbols, peels paint, follows painted instructions. The murals teach her she is "not merely a scholar but a candidate," but this realization arrives without a trade-off or visible sacrifice. The urgency of dawn and the closing window is stated then waived ("she did not rush"), removing the tightening pressure. No on-page reversal or choice forecloses a path; the stairway materializes as reward for correct method.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain isolated or reopen contact—is signaled early and sustained. The encroachment and the appearance of the gasping figure introduce pressure, and the protagonist's choice to step through the threshold is on the page. Yet the escalation is abstract; the figure "teaches" rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. No live option is foreclosed mid-scene, and the resolution feels more like acceptance than a turn driven by protagonist agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: can Maya trust a promise again? The glitchy texts complicate, the farm deepens, but no reversal narrows options—she walks in, witnesses, and exits lighter without a visible trade-off. The "quantum promise" manifests passively; Maya's only agency is to show up and cry. Under Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the cost of belief is told ("feeling lighter") rather than paid in action or renunciation, capping escalation credit.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what her grandmother kept hidden—is signaled clearly in the opening third and drives each discovery beat. The gramophone's resistance → yield → sound emergence provides one meaningful tightening under an Accumulative lens. However, the truncated ending means no on-page cost or trade-off appears; we never see whether Elara accepts, rejects, or is altered by the truth. The escalation builds coherently but stops short of the moment where agency and cost must appear.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Aldric's search for quietude transforming into engagement with possibility—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or trade-off. His manipulation of the marionettes unfolds without visible difficulty, cost, or reversal; he simply performs the sequence and receives the gift. The vow "completing itself" reads passive, undermining protagonist agency. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the greenhouse's dissolution is atmospheric rather than a consequence of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring small kindnesses lost to bureaucratic record—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Mara examines the button, imagines its history, and begins documentation without a tightening that narrows options or a trade-off that costs her something. No reversal or deepening changes her knowledge or forecloses a path. The piece accumulates texture but does not deliver the "one meaningful tightening" that would register under the Accumulative lens as pressure increase; instead it sustains a single reflective posture.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping discovery and preserving the archive—is signaled early and tightens when the audit exposes the vault. Mira's one-hour window creates temporal pressure, and the lagoon sequence narrows her options. However, the escalation is mostly external (security closing in) rather than driven by protagonist agency; Mira executes a pre-existing contingency plan without meaningful on-page reversals or trade-offs. The discovery of the complete archive in the tunnel is a windfall rather than a earned turn, and no visible price is paid at closure—she descends successfully, plans intact, with only future risk implied.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from speaking itself into existence—is signaled early and pressure tightens when "a phrase broke through," forcing the saxophonist to respond with three sharp notes. That moment narrows options and demonstrates agency, but the cost is legible only in mood (ragged breath, relief) rather than a visible trade-off or forfeited alternative. The escalation is coherent under the situational lens, yet the single reversal lacks a prior complication or mistake that raises the price; the protagonist's mastery makes the task feel enacted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the prophecy to save her people—is signaled early, but pressure remains flat: Seraphina encounters no resistance, competing goal, or moment where decoding fails or costs her something tangible. The drought prophecy and seed discovery arrive as fulfillment rather than escalation. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the Hush simply "reaches its peak" while she "feels herself shifting" by authorial fiat. Agency is absent; the plot unfolds as revelation rather than decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (recovering the compass/brother's memory) is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs: the letter's vague description → concrete discovery of the greenhouse → descent toward the brass object. However, the piece stops before escalation can force a meaningful choice or trade-off. No reversal or deepening alters options; Maren encounters no resistance, surprise, or cost. The descent is atmospheric continuation rather than pressure that narrows paths or demands sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her brother's obsession and her own complicity in dismissing him—is signaled early and tightens through the restoration process. The kintsugi decision is a meaningful choice that forecloses the option of simple repair or denial, and the work itself (sorting, pouring, waiting) creates on-page pressure. Cost is present: five years of avoidance, the acknowledgment of her "balanced reputation on safe discoveries" versus his risk. The escalation is more textural than causal, appropriate to the lens, but the brother's absence limits direct conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (helping the soldier release) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The soldier appears "many times" before this encounter, deflating urgency. No reversal or tightening occurs—Mira performs her ritual, the soldier responds predictably, the cycle continues. The ending announces "another spirit stirred, ready to confess" without escalation or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or the cadence shift; here the piece loops without meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue fleeing or confront the unknown price—is signaled when Mira realizes the unlocked doors might be "just another form of experiment." Pressure accumulates through the strap's increasing hum and the clearing's pull. The tightening occurs at the threshold where "whatever waited for her there would demand a price she had not yet calculated," forcing a trade-off between comfortable numbness and "something stranger and perhaps more true." Agency is expressed through endurance (not removing the strap) and stance crystallization at the clearing's edge with conceptual cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding the fragment's purpose and the protagonist's role. Pressure accumulates through the market discovery, alchemist's explanation, and painting revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes they're not honoring histories but becoming one. Agency is present in the final choice to unfasten the clasp and let the fragment hang free, though this feels more acceptance than struggle. The tightening is clean but the visible cost—what path is foreclosed—remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—discover what the ceiling hides—is signaled early and tightens when the presence "pressed closer" and Marcus climbs toward the hatch, narrowing options from passive observation to active engagement. The tightening is meaningful: his dual gift (elevator expert + echo-reader) forces the choice to pursue the mystery despite professional boundaries. Cost is visible in his commitment ("he always did") and the physical act of climbing, foreclosing the option to complete the paperwork and leave. One minor friction: the echo's infallibility ("never guided him falsely") slightly undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translating the whisper into permanence—is signaled early but remains abstract until the press scene. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara places the bottle against the platen, narrowing options to a binary (open or preserve), yet no dramatized obstacle or competing cost shapes that choice. The "rupture" and "cascade of syllables" deliver spectacle without tactical consequence: the Library grows new sections, but Elara's role or stance does not shift with visible price. Accumulative pressure builds through the frost → bottle → press sequence, but the final act lacks a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative with on-page weight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the founders' true nature and what that truth means for civilization's self-conception—is signaled early through the archaeological dispute framing. Storm arrival creates immediate physical pressure (cover mirrors before temporal violence erupts), which braids with the epistemic question. The glimpse of hollow-eyed founders narrows options: Vespera can no longer hold the official heroic narrative. Her final choice to cover the mirror while accepting multiplicity forecloses her earlier revolutionary demand for "a single story, a single future"—a visible cost scaled appropriately to this length. The escalation proceeds through accumulative pressure (time's visibility, storm's approach, founders' revelation) rather than causal reversals, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: restore the stolen light through the covenant of rust. The tightening is structural—forty years compress into this single attempt to bind moonlight fragments to the orchestrion. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the last connection clicked into place" and the note rises, but Cassian's agency in that moment is mechanical rather than a choice under competing pressures. No reversal tests his commitment; the task proceeds without complication or visible cost that narrows options. The resolution is earned by persistence, yet the final act lacks a dramatized trade-off or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for the threshold where meaning dissolves—is signaled early and tightens once meaningfully: the compass reading redirects her from surface collection to subterranean delving. The lagoon confrontation crystallizes the cost: "there was nothing to capture here" forecloses her entire practice. Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient escalation with legible price. A second reversal or complication in the descent could have raised pressure further, but the single deepening is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding her place in the lineage of makers. The storm and GPS failure complicate but do not resolve; the archway moment tightens when the slide's secret narrows her self-concept from solitary sculptor to participant in a timewoven conversation. Agency is attention and realization that forecloses the path of isolation—she commits to the largest piece she's ever attempted, a gesture toward communion. The price is legible: devotion, the endless curriculum, the rhythm that remains in her hands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and sustained through Mira's months of study. The piece accumulates pressure through seasonal transition and the mounting particulars (postcards, frost patterns, light angles), culminating in the cathedral window discovery that reframes her understanding. However, the escalation is largely contemplative; no external opposition tests Mira's commitment, and the turn feels more like patient waiting rewarded than agency forging a path. The resolution's cost—transforming her mural from "decorative commission into something true"—implies professional risk but doesn't show a client's objection, a deadline pressure, or a visible sacrifice that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering her grandmother's truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The tightening occurs when Miriam deciphers the diary and descends to the lagoon, but the resolution is delivered by the grandmother's apparition rather than Miriam's agency. No on-page reversal or trade-off; the parley succeeded off-stage, and Miriam becomes a passive witness. The cost of "remembering when all others had forgotten" is declared but not felt in forfeited options or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving the civilization through memory—is signaled early but never faces a live obstacle or tightening. Elias's plan unfolds without reversal, complication, or trade-off. No on-page moment narrows options or forces a sacrifice. The "reject false comfort" attribute is mentioned but not tested. Escalation is absent; the bottle's release is a set-piece spectacle, not a pressure-driven turn. The ending declares success without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the prophecy embedded in her grandmother's recording and hearing the dead's accumulated oaths—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure accumulates through textural density (layers of time, language, memory) rather than causal confrontation, appropriate to the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: the wax immersion shifts her from wondering to hearing. However, agency is largely receptive; Seraphine does not face a trade-off or make a decision that narrows options. The cost—"velvet disquiet," promises "waiting for those who knew how to listen"—is atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. Under the Accumulative lens this structure is valid, but the tightening remains subtle and the price implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—performing the vortex inheritance ritual to pass temporal awareness—is signaled early and pursued with single-minded focus. However, escalation reads as steady intensification rather than a meaningful narrowing or tightening: no live option is foreclosed, no reversal forces trade-off. The seedling's emergence and vortex sealing unfold as planned ritual steps without visible friction or cost that alters Elara's tactics, leaving pressure more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—ensuring the warning system works before zero hour—is signaled early and pursued cleanly. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric data and the approaching storm, then tightens when Elara begins the test sequence. The switch-throw is a decision with systemic stakes (30,000 people), but it unfolds as planned execution rather than an escalation that narrows options or forces a trade-off on the page. The invisible front revealing itself provides external confirmation, not a reversal driven by protagonist agency. Cost is implied (responsibility, precision) but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and understanding fallen stars—is signaled early but remains static. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the janitor encounters a star fragment exactly as expected and handles it exactly as described in prior reflection. No escalation under any lens: the fragment's discovery does not complicate, the janitor's method succeeds without friction, and the ending recapitulates the opening philosophy. Agency is observation, not decision with cost. Coincidence (finding the fragment) initiates the beat but no protagonist choice alters trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the covenant of unspoken words—is signaled early but remains abstract; the ghost's need and Mira's acceptance lack concrete opposition or trade-off. The single tightening (ghost gesture → excavation → transfer) is present, but no live option is foreclosed on the page; Mira's recluse life continues without visible alteration. The cost is asserted ("crushing weight") rather than shown through a forfeited path, missed opportunity, or on-page price. Agency is present (she digs, accepts) but the choice feels inevitable rather than pressured by competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; her "rediscovery" three days ago is told in summary, and her garage-sale-listing method never encounters resistance or complication. The ending delivers thematic insight without protagonist agency or visible cost, failing the escalation test for Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and tightened once when the poet realizes "the string was missing" and must choose whether to view this as failure or invitation. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening under its Accumulative lens: the kingfisher's return and clumsy flight demonstrate that incompleteness does not preclude gesture or meaning. However, the escalation is contemplative rather than high-pressure; the poet faces no competing goods or unavoidable harms, and the "recognition" arrives without visible friction. The conceptual cost (accepting that "completeness was not the point") is undeniable in the final image but the stakes remain abstract—no live option is truly foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: completing the remodel before death, signaled early. The diagnosis tightens options (six months), and Maren's choice to double workload rather than retreat narrows her path. However, escalation is muted—no on-page reversal complicates her labor, no competing demand tests her commitment. The final beat reaffirms her stance ("Death was simply another transition") without a turn or visible price paid in the moment. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (ladder climb + acceptance) but pressure remains static rather than compounding.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is stated but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elena's "artificial pilgrimage" involves no visible obstacles, trade-offs, or costs; she walks up, meditates, walks down. No escalation or deepening occurs; the piece is a continuous reflective mood without pressure points. The aliens and her lost academic position are backstory context, not present forces that complicate her choices. Agency is entirely internal observation without a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring life to the dead reef—is signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs: the coachman's ritual plants become the green thread that breaks the water. However, the escalation lacks friction; no setback tests his commitment, no competing obligation forces a trade-off, and the reef's response arrives as reward rather than consequence of a costly choice. The birds' silence and the "first stirrings" create atmosphere but do not narrow options or impose a visible price. Agency is present (planting, speaking the spell) but uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (find brother's message) is signaled early and pressure tightens once: the narrator shifts from scent-based search to tactile decoding, a meaningful turn under the textural lens. That turn arises from protagonist agency (months of device construction, trial methods) and demonstrates one escalation. However, the resolution lacks visible cost—unlocking the cylinder confirms existing hope rather than forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a pursuit. No live option is narrowed; the "wild hush" and waiting posture persist unchanged, limiting band entry to mid-6s under the escalation guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—is declared but never tested by a competing pressure or cost on the page. The "glimpse" delivers insight without requiring Mira to forfeit an alternative path. No reversal tightens options; the shutdown is backstory, and the final sketching act unfolds without obstacle or trade-off. Accumulative lens allows this, but pressure remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (amending the theft) is signaled early, but the conflict remains static: Caelius arrives with the solution already in hand, and Seraph's appearance triggers no reversal or tightening. The chess pieces arrive as a deus ex machina; their mechanics ("secrets inside waiting like trapped birds") are invoked but never tested or resisted. Seraph's line "This is impossible" hints at complication but is immediately deflated by Caelius's platitude. No visible cost accompanies the exchange—he kneels, hands over the pouch, and the narrative asserts resolution without on-page price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—releasing the sister's memory—is signaled early and remains coherent. Mira's movement from spelling the sister's name "one final time" to spelling "beginning" constitutes a single tightening under the Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length. However, the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff or cost on the page; the shift from holding to releasing is declared rather than dramatized through a contested choice. The interregnum provides ambient pressure but does not force Mira to forfeit a live option, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding home and reclaiming buried talent—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seven-night consideration and the eighth-night question, creating one meaningful deepening when the seer speaks aloud. However, escalation occurs largely in reflection; the keeper's challenge is met off-page across "seven nights." No on-page reversal tests her commitment with visible cost during the attempt. The decision to leave carries implied cost (vulnerability, unknown reception) but the final image declares rather than dramatizes the price.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: self-forgiveness for past pedagogical failure. The lull and tapestry discovery provide one meaningful tightening when Mira begins decoding the border threads. Thunder resuming and villagers moving supply external escalation that mirrors her internal shift. Agency is present—she chooses to approach the labyrinth, decode the tapestry—but the work itself is contemplative rather than conflicted; no live option is tested or refused on the page. The cost is emotional release rather than a visible trade-off, fitting the accumulative lens but limiting band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: Sera must distribute truth before the ritual erases it, risking exile or worse. The pressure tightens when children appear and multiply her words, then escalates when priests arrive—though their arrival feels slightly inevitable rather than caused by her choices. The escalation is clean under the Accumulative lens: density increases from solo act to chorus. Agency is strong: Sera's decision to teach children (rather than shout) drives the key turn. Cost is visible but not fully tested on the page—the priests arrive, but we don't see Sera lose anything concrete in that moment, only gain rhetorical freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning before death—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal; the ritual of matching scars proceeds without meaningful tightening or obstacle until the final breath delivers understanding. The alchemist's agency is primarily contemplative; she narrates and traces rather than makes choices that foreclose options. The "perhaps three breaths left" timeframe creates situational urgency but never forces a trade-off or cost that alters tactics. One deepening moment (the final realization) meets the 600–800-word threshold but lacks the visible price that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Marcus rediscovering why he painted—is signaled early and deepened by the shell's appearance and the pool's reflection. The piece tightens through accumulation: wandering → discovery → recognition → release. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, and the final act of placing the shell forecloses his three-year refusal with felt cost. The "temporary eternity" reweighting narrows his options from possession to witness, satisfying escalation requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: guide the sailors safely using the old technique Thessaly entrusted to her. The heat wave's thermal currents create urgent pressure; sailors' signals grow desperate. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira uncorks the vial and must purify her intention without needing recognition—a credible internal escalation under the Accumulative lens. The first ship turning within the hour provides an on-page result, though the reversal is understated. Agency is present (Mira's choice to send the vibration), but the climactic act feels more like enactment of learned wisdom than a decision under competing pressures. Cost is implied (solitude, ego renunciation) but not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—navigate grief geography for the lost—is signaled early. The midnight call provides a meaningful tightening: the woman tries to walk north against collective advice, and Mara's decision to meet her and walk together forecloses the option of passive listening. The cost is visible: Mara will repeatedly descend into the marsh, enduring the fluctuating clarity of lunar cycles. Under an Accumulative lens, the single on-page reversal (call received → descent committed → woman found) narrows options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety by finding the rumored cure—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Mira climbs, reflects, and arrives at the hollow without meaningful obstacle orChoice under pressure. The "storm had battered this place" is past-tense description, not present escalation. The ending offers symbolic persistence rather than a decision that forecloses options or reveals cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is expected but not delivered; the piece circles its premise rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early, but escalation occurs via flashback revelation rather than present-scene pressure that narrows options. No reversal tests Aldric's commitment; the solution arrives through a discovered note rather than investigative cost or trade-off. The stranger's disappearance and Aldric's investigation method ("observing gaps") are asserted without dramatized friction or failure that would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the path her father promised—is signaled early and tightens as Maren descends with the rising creek serving as a live clock. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversals: each discovered element (ants, flowers, doorframe) deepens the pattern until the final door choice. The rising water creates genuine urgency and forecloses the option to delay. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is the irrevocable step through as water rises.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (unraveling the recurring dreams) is signaled early and tightens through the climb, with one meaningful deepening when the bleeding starlight reveals itself as the source of her dreams. The queen's agency is primarily observational at closure ("she understood," "the disenchanted queen smiled") rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final warning and three-year timeframe add pressure, but the resolution arrives through witness and realization rather than a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing presence—is signaled early but never tested with a live on-page choice that forecloses an option. No reversal or tightening occurs; Maren arrives with understanding already achieved and simply explicates it. The whispered secret is mentioned but not dramatized, and its content or consequence remains off-page. Escalation is absent; the piece plateaus in reflective mode without pressure or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative before the grave becomes literal—is signaled early and recurs. Pressure accumulates through reflection and image layering rather than causal escalation; the piece deepens rather than tightens, consistent with Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or choice narrows options with visible cost; the protagonist's final stance ("I will let the feral nostalgia take me") reads as surrender without a trade-off or foreclosed alternative dramatized in scene. Agency is renunciation, but the endurance lacks visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elena's effort to reconstruct purpose after sensory loss. Pressure deepens through accumulation—thirty-seven days ago, learning clock architecture, the screw revelation, tea moment—rather than external reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency manifests as sustained attention and reframing rather than decision; the cost is visible in her forfeited identity as aromatherapist. One meaningful tightening occurs when the screw's history reweights her understanding of "beginnings." The piece lacks a second live option or visible trade-off at the closure beat, keeping it mid-band for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why runes resist her and successfully inscribing them—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara stops forcing academic symbols and lets intuition guide the quill, narrowing her method to one authentic path. The cost (shedding cynicism, accepting the crystallizing affliction publicly on this platform) is legible in the final act. The piece does not require multiple reversals at this length; the single pivot from textbook precision to intuitive memory-driven inscription is sufficient escalation under the Accumulative lens. No convenient luck resolves the problem—Elara's shift in approach drives the successful inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology before the induced current fails—is signaled early and tightens as the chainsaws start and the connection fades. Eleanor's speech constitutes agency (renunciation of her prior silence) with visible cost: the miracle is "imperfect" and "delivered too late to matter." The pressure accumulates and narrows options under a causal lens, though the escalation relies on time running out rather than a protagonist decision that raises the stakes mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    No dominant stake is dramatized—observation replaces decision throughout. The Spiral of Arbitration is described but never engaged; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The piece delivers pure accumulation of atmosphere without escalation, agency, or a trade-off that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing is at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding what clocks really measure, braided with her devotion to shepherding. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density ("fjord quiet...a living thing holding its breath") and her solitary status, but no on-page reversal or competing option tests her commitment. The arrival of dawn and her epiphany about clocks measuring "change itself" deepen understanding without narrowing tactics or forcing a trade-off. Her decision to continue "for seventeen years more" is stated but not dramatized against a visible alternative, leaving the cost implicit rather than sharply legible.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking to understand her father's gambling and her own relationship to risk—is signaled early. The story deepens rather than escalates: her realization about the scrawls represents a shift in understanding, not a tightening of options or a forced trade-off. The "traverse" from library to hospital is summarized rather than dramatized, and no visible on-page reversal narrows her choices. The closure reconfigures meaning (CR under the accumulative lens), but the lack of a concrete pressure point or live cost in the final third keeps this in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mira's practice of witnessing strangers through wrong numbers and teaching endings how to begin. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options—she describes her method and waits, but the story delivers exposition of past loops rather than a live escalation. The final beat ("The phone rang") promises pressure but does not show her tested or altered within the text, leaving escalation potential rather than realized.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: accepting that preservation means allowing change rather than freezing moments. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist overcomes her fear that "looking too closely would diminish the image" and finds the photo enriched instead—this shifts her understanding and enables the final promise. Agency is renunciation (releasing impossible expectations) with conceptual cost legible in the metaphor shift from amber to breathing. No on-page antagonist; pressure accumulates through internal conflict and the liminal timeframe. The tightening is modest but present; a sharper trade-off would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—curing the logistician's loneliness—is signaled early and escalates through the revealed trade rule that requires vulnerability. One meaningful tightening occurs when the reciprocity mechanism is explained, forcing the protagonist to recognize their own need. The promise to stay until midnight and talk to whoever wanders in represents agency with visible cost: the end of their elusiveness. However, the woman's role is mostly expository, and the final turn feels more conversational than high-pressure. The escalation is sufficient under the Accumulative lens but lacks visceral urgency in the exchange itself.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (reaching the stillpoint to map emotional depths) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal—Elara walks, the ring warms, she arrives. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the melody "revealed itself" and the stillpoint simply "waited," implying passive discovery rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The assertion that the stillpoint is "not a destination but a doorway" occurs after arrival without prior setup, reading as a late conceptual claim rather than an earned turn. No visible cost attaches to the journey—time passes ambiguously, no stamina or resource is spent, and the final state ("never be lost again") suggests resolution without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: decoding the folded signal to prove her interpretive skill after the Proxima Centauri misidentification. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira shifts from isolating frequencies to tracing contingent relationships, and the payoff—recognizing the signal as a response—deepens understanding and validates her unorthodox method. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive rather than enacted under rising pressure; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the cost (delaying her report) is soft. The gravitational anomaly complicates but does not force a trade-off with felt stakes. Agency is present but operates more as patient discovery than decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: translating/mapping her grandmother's silence into communicable form. One tightening occurs when Elena appears and Marina must move from practiced tales to spontaneous grief-signing, but this shift feels coincidental (Elena drifts in) rather than driven by Marina's prior choices. The cost of this new signing is asserted ("love folded into shapes her grandmother had never taught") but not demonstrated as a foreclosed alternative or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (fulfilling grandmother's promise) is signaled but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening. The portrait's hidden mechanisms open without resistance; no choice narrows options or imposes cost. The three-year stay is told in summary, not dramatized. Agency is absent—Mira discovers rather than decides, and the resolution ("she carried...a promise fulfilled") lacks a visible price or foreclosed path. Escalation under any lens is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—to externalize/realize Mira's dream—is signaled but remains abstract until the ending. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is subtle: the drumming pattern deepens from solo practice to a garden-wide cascade. No live tightening or trade-off narrows Elara's options; she performs the ritual without cost or complication. The scientists' future discovery is mentioned but not dramatized, undercutting closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "whispers travel farther than shouts" frames the challenge against official channels. One meaningful tightening: the storm disables all tech, forcing reliance on the whisper network. Agency is clear—Mira's decision to trust her annotated maps and send workers by word alone. The cost is conceptual (proving her network against Reyes's hierarchy) but remains somewhat abstract; we see two hundred workers guided but the escalation reads more as validation than a narrowing gauntlet. The reversal when Reyes concedes lands cleanly but the path feels more accumulative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether the boy will remain "drowning in his own shadows" or find a reason to stay. The guardian's patient presence and light patterns create one meaningful tightening when the boy notices and lifts his head, narrowing his despair into attention. No second reversal occurs; the escalation is subtle—a shift from isolation to witnessed solitude. The cost is felt in "stillwater tension" and the boy's unspoken acknowledgment, but agency remains ambiguous; the boy does not make an on-page choice that forecloses suicide, only observes. The guardian's action drives the turn, yet the boy's passivity limits the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page moment shows Eleanor facing a trade-off or forfeiting a live option. The window displays and chess teaching are described as effects (mother reconsidering college, teenager asking father) but these are narrated outcomes, not dramatized pressure that Eleanor navigates with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; the text offers only repeated assertions ("not grand gestures but humble rebellions") without tightening Eleanor's tactics or reweighting her risk. Escalation is absent—each paragraph restates the same idea (quiet rebellion spreads) without narrowing options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Maren's choice between guarded self-preservation and vulnerable liberation—is signaled early and tightens when the whale's call forces her to act. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes the scrimshaw unlocks her own heart, not others', and steps into the water. Agency is present: she detaches from the talisman and moves toward transformation. The cost is felt—she forecloses her known life and steps into mystery. Pressure accumulates through the whale's repeated call and her interior shift, though the escalation leans more on reflection than on competing live options dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserving interiority (grief, memory) under the happiness mandate. One meaningful deepening occurs when she holds the finished wooden rose beside the dried bouquet and the narration shifts from compliance performance to claiming "peace…the weightlessness of having survived both." The ending reconfigures her blank face from professional costume to "defiantly blank," foreclosing performance as mere survival. Cost is oblique but present: she remains in the emotional void, isolated, her grief "made light" but never resolved. Agency is renunciation and endurance with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—crossing the sacred colonnade—is signaled early but remains abstract. The narrative presents walking through as inevitable discovery rather than escalating pressure: each column "seems to draw closer," boundaries "dissolve like morning frost," with no resistance, trade-off, or credible obstacle. The tremor of certainty functions as authorial guarantee, eliminating genuine stakes. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the proclaimed transformation lacks visible cost, preventing escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's desire to communicate and share her way of seeing—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the apprentice asks "You're speaking to me," which narrows options and she responds by escalating her arrangements and ultimately gifting the reed tongue. The apprentice's agency ("began to learn") provides closure participation, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral: we see the gift handed over, yet what Mira loses or risks by passing forward her "bartered awakening" is not dramatized with a felt price. The escalation reads as deepening through accumulation of plant-language complexity rather than a causal reversal that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether artificial pilgrimage can carry genuine weight—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. However, pressure remains constant rather than escalating; the trial run is announced but not dramatized, so no on-page tightening occurs. Elara's agency is entirely internal and reflective; no decision forecloses a path or tests competing priorities. The piece operates as design and contemplation rather than conflict under pressure. The final understanding reweights the concept but does so through assertion rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: guiding the new arrival toward illumination. The tightening occurs when Elara descends and offers the pendant—a single meaningful gesture. Yet the new arrival's acceptance unfolds without resistance or complication; no reversal tests Elara's centuries of practice. The cost is implied but not legible: we don't see what Elara forfeits or how this encounter differs from prior guidances. The promise to "meet yourself, a few years from now" is declaration, not on-page constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Soren's need to find the collapse's cause and assign blame, versus the necessity of accepting complicity without solution. The measuring-tape gesture and card spread deepen pressure by externalizing his internal mapping compulsion. His confession "I helped build it" is the key tightening that forecloses his analyst stance and opens a path forward. The cost—his voice breaking, the twelve-foot span symbolizing distance he must cross—is legible. One meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding purification of nostalgia atoms—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the dance and the pagoda's response, but escalation is textural rather than driven by protagonist choice that narrows options. The "steadily unpredictable" method is enacted but does not face a test or reversal that forces a trade-off. The ending posits transformation ("I would emerge changed") without showing what specific path or capability is foreclosed by stepping into the pagoda's embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope as it transforms—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation remains abstract: Mira watches footage and reflects, but no live option narrows on the page. The "argument" she is building has no on-page recipient or test. The piece deepens our understanding of the Unbinding and hope's metamorphosis, consistent with Accumulative/Textural lens, but the final beat does not tighten options or force a trade-off. Agency is present (she continues her vigil) but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a moment that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: can Mara reconstruct self-respect after Aldric's betrayal? One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes "certainty had been a cage as much as a foundation," narrowing her tactical options from restoring blind trust to accepting imperfection. The tail tip's irreparable damage becomes the pressure point—she cannot make it whole, only "whole enough," forcing a tradeoff between perfection and honoring the creature. Agency operates through endurance (continuing the work, preparing to face staff tomorrow) with visible cost: the loss of her former beautiful certainty. No antagonist appears on the page; pressure remains internal and accumulative under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting buried guilt over her brother's death—is signaled early and tightens through the tunnel discovery and handprint revelation. The coffee rings provide a meaningful reversal (grandmother was waiting, not abandoning), and the final handprint moment forecloses Maya's self-blame with emotional weight. The scars shift from shame-objects to love-evidence. However, the resolution arrives through discovery and reinterpretation rather than a choice that costs Maya something in the present; she finds answers rather than sacrificing an option to earn them.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is Mira's quest to understand where unused love is stored. Pressure accumulates through layered visions (mirror, letters, final performance), but Mira faces no reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The sisters' unuttered goodbye and hidden canister supply emotional escalation in backstory, yet Mira's present-tense arc is a straight line: locate, witness, return. No on-page cost or trade-off shapes her final action; the resolution is philosophical rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice occurs; Seraphine's shift from grasping to stillness is a posture change, not a decision that narrows options or incurs visible cost. The narrative tells us "creative imprisonment crack[s]" and stardust "pour[s] forth," but no concrete action, forfeiture, or trade-off demonstrates the price paid or the new constraint she now faces. Escalation is textural (repetition of "remembered stardust," aurora imagery) but does not compress options or force a stakes-based choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: protecting the cargo against those who would claim it. The merchant's offer supplies one meaningful pressure point that forces Mira to articulate her purpose. Her refusal and explanation constitute agency with conceptual cost (she accepts the loneliness of her mission). Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening occurs when the merchant quotes the old phrase and Mira must respond with her own answer, narrowing ambiguity. The stakes remain somewhat abstract; a second on-page complication or a visible tactical trade-off would have sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Cyrus seeking to "rediscover the wild frontier of your mind"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One pressure point appears when he reaches the tangle, kneels, and places the gear, but the barrier dissolves without resistance or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid on the page. The "hum of insight rising in his chest" substitutes for escalation, and the resolution arrives through epiphany rather than agency-driven choice under stress. No secondary complication tests his commitment; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist action narrow options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and tightens through the vigil's end and the leash's release. The guides' silent question and the elder's horizon gesture deepen pressure by externalizing the woman's internal reckoning. The middle path choice narrows options with visible cost (the leash falls away, decades of safety are forfeited), and the star-stamp token marks earned passage. No antagonist is required; the woman's own decades-long avoidance supplies resistance until the ridgeway crest.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety versus movement—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus finds the bolt and must choose whether to report or follow. The discovery narrows options (remain/flee, see/look away) and his choice to pocket the bolt and continue upward constitutes agency with on-page cost: he forecloses the path of protocol and re-engages with risk. However, the escalation is more contemplative than pressured; no external antagonist or urgent consequence sharpens the trade-off, keeping the felt price moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (unmask the pretender), but no on-page pressure materializes. Threnody faces no opposition, no reversal, no tightening choice that narrows her options. The "trap from paper and ink" is described in summary; we never see her encounter resistance, adapt tactics, or pay a cost. The piece tells us she has prepared across eleven generations without dramatizing a single escalation beat. No agency is exercised on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "which underwater highways might regenerate and which had vanished forever." One meaningful tightening occurs when the buoy data reveals the unexpected coral colony, forcing Elara to confront her assumption that "some paths had simply disappeared." The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing. Her final action—inventing a new tapping pattern to communicate with the buoys—shows agency (endurance transformed into exploration) with conceptual cost (abandoning the seven-year rhythm). Pressure coheres through interleaved reflection and the surprise discovery, though the trade-off is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: what will the rebellion become during the lull? Pressure accumulates through Kira's observation of the circle's changing hum and her internal debate about meaning. The tightening occurs when she presses her palms to the stone and hears "a chord of possibility rather than memory," which narrows her options to action. Cost clarity is weak: no live option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical trade-off shown. The resolution—walking barefoot toward the exit to carry the hum to others—feels like an intention rather than a decision with on-page consequence. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of felt price caps this in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (whether to unseal the chamber versus rebury the embryo) is signaled by mid-story. One meaningful tightening occurs when Yara recognizes the kite script as a map and chooses to decode it with Anya. However, the resolution lacks visible cost: plants "calm," the embryo pulses warmth, and the decision reads as mutual affirmation rather than a trade-off that forecloses safety or violates community trust. Pressure coheres but does not narrow options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—building survivable relation to trauma—is clear from paragraph two and tightens through the four-year cereus arc. Pressure accumulates through the accumulative lens: daily greenhouse work, freeze episodes, photograph handling, until the bloom forces crystallization. The protagonist's agency appears in micro-choices (never smoothing the photograph, letting wild plants be, waiting out freeze responses) and the final choice to recognize the space she's built. Cost is legible: years of solitude, permanent distance from conventional healing, acceptance of grief as weather. One meaningful deepening (cereus realization) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Mira's need to understand and reclaim her fractured artistic vision. The discovery of the scattered cards tightens the problem, and the untangling action deepens when she follows threads downward, narrowing her options toward acceptance rather than repair. The resolution is protagonist-driven—her hands work where her eyes cannot—and the cost is legible: she forecloses the path of singular portraiture. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes the cards are "waiting to be seen differently." The stakes remain coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is quiet and the visible price (abandoning her former method) could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and braided with finding Vasquez. Pressure accumulates through textural layering: the ink patterns, the temporal thinning sensation, the "consciously wild intelligence" waiting. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist choices; the tracker observes, kneels, watches, then touches ink without visible alternatives or tactical shifts. The resolution (dissolution into the mystery) happens to him rather than through his agency. One deepening occurs when the ink glows and time begins to thin, but the cost of his final action—becoming part of the phenomenon—is told more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (whether to release the contraband letter) is signaled early. Escalation under the causal lens requires a tightening that narrows options or raises cost; here, the piece offers contemplation but no reversal or complication. Kira's agency appears as decision, but no obstacle tests her commitment—the networks "wait" for her, the system "had learned" she was ready, and transmission proceeds without friction. The resolution is driven by her choice, yet the cost ("everything changed") remains declarative rather than a visible forfeiture. One meaningful pressure point is present (the letter's revelation) but it does not force a trade-off with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—choosing nurture over violence—is signaled early but operates entirely in retrospective mode without present pressure. The "chaos beyond the dome" and refugee encounter exist as summary rather than on-page escalation. No live reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the piece delivers one consistent philosophical stance from start to finish. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening would suffice, but the retrospective frame prevents visible cost at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled clearly and drives the piece. One meaningful tightening occurs when Morwen realizes others' noise scatters the echo, forcing him to "voice silence itself" as counter-tactic. The zigzag movement and choice to receive rather than strike narrow the approach. Cost is present (he becomes permanent vessel, isolation implied by "only he could hear") but the escalation feels more like progressive revelation than pressure that tests commitment; the garden essentially guides him to success rather than forcing hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—clearing her name and breaking the family cycle—is signaled early and remains coherent. The "proof by contradiction" moment narrows options (she moves from defense to offense), creating one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is cerebral: the reversal happens through logical deduction rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. The journalist's claim and Eleanor's counter-evidence remain abstract; no on-page confrontation or tactical trade-off dramatizes the price of her decision to "intervene."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—resolving guilt by hearing her sister's message—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. Every step (finding letters, entering lab, using amber, following coordinates) succeeds without friction, cost, or trade-off. The "one chance to translate her guilt into action" arrives as declaration, not dramatized narrowing of options. The story ends at the threshold of action ("began to work") rather than showing a choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering meaning in the mess) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory alignment and the tile's discovery, then deepens when Elara interjects the tile—a micro-turn that feels inevitable rather than forced, narrowing her path from avoidance to acceptance. The cost is legible: she releases her grip on permanence, accepts impermanence as method. However, the escalation is gentle and accumulative rather than sharply forked; no reversal truly tests her against a competing want or visible loss beyond internal permission. Strong for a textural lens but lacks the trade-off visibility that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to preserve meaning after total destruction—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when Lysara encounters Soren and realizes she can "rename what remained." The reversal that she cannot undo the fire but can gift the living narrows her options and forecloses the path of literal restoration. The cost is legible: she accepts that the dead are lost and commits to a transformation that will look like madness to others. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through the tessera's discovery, Soren's recognition, and the final act of pressing the stone into his hands, which reweights the stakes from preservation of artifacts to preservation of capacity for empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking an encore, Mira facing despair—is signaled early. The orchard encounter provides a single tightening (Mira's presence forces Elara to act), but no reversal narrows options: the echoes appear on command, Mira accepts without resistance, and the coin transfers without friction. Coincidence dominates (Mira "had come to the emporium because she had nowhere else to go"), and the resolution is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (finding connection without the pills' harm) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira applies the crystal and perceives the "intricate web" of connection, reweighting her understanding of the pills' failure. Yet this deepening is delivered to her—no protagonist agency tightens the screw. The resolution (devise a gentler method) is declared, not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the ending reweights meaning but does not narrow options or impose a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Maren's search for purpose as a sensory cartographer—is signaled early but never faces on-page pressure that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The piece offers a deepening of understanding (theoretical work → active voice) but this shift is declared in reflection rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost. No reversal, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a prior path; the algae's brightened pulse and the fossil's "ancient permanence" are atmospheric rather than stakes-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the canyon echo to reveal prophecy's pattern—is signaled early. Yet the piece offers no meaningful tightening: the jar opens, the whisper speaks, Elara cross-references, the Seers approve, she resumes work. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the protagonist encounters no resistance. Cost is gestured at ("unfinished stories") but never materialized in a trade-off or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver proof and reclaim courage—is signaled early. The arrival of the second spy provides one tightening that forces Elena to decide whether to trust. However, the piece leans on Elena's internal conviction rather than external resistance; no credible loss or visible cost alters tactics before the handoff. The tightening narrows options but the price remains more felt than demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—carrying forward what deserves preservation—is signaled early and coherent. Yet pressure remains static: the coachman waits, reflects, then boards the barge without complication or tightening. No reversal or deepening changes options or knowledge; the ferryman's arrival feels summoned rather than earned by protagonist agency. The ending delivers thematic resonance but lacks the on-page escalation or visible cost required for higher bands under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding why places resist change. The journey and discovery provide one meaningful deepening—Mira perceives fractured timelines and realizes gentleness can be "sharp enough to cut through any timeline." However, escalation is primarily perceptual; no on-page reversal forces a difficult choice or forecloses an option with visible cost. The lantern's thrum and Mira's phototropic response create coherent pressure, but the final beat recounts future intention rather than immediate agency. Cost is conceptual (carrying the oasis inside her) rather than a live tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—consoling the grieving child and instilling hope—is signaled early. The tightening arrives when Maren invites the girl up and explains the gauge tooth, shifting from observation to teaching. Yet no on-page reversal narrows options or imposes a trade-off; the girl's progression from tears to planting feels smooth and uncontested. The cost (waiting, pruning, faith in roots) is discussed rather than dramatized as a foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present, but escalation pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is diffuse: Elara walks, reflects, and discovers the new volume without visible opposition or cost. The tide rising functions as atmospheric pressure rather than a constraint that narrows options. The final moment when she wades toward the eastern stacks carries charged poise, but no on-page price is paid; the discovery arrives as gift rather than earned turn. One tightening (the sundial's shadow pointing east) deepens meaning without forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is Mira's search for connection between her scattered letters and herself. The nest discovery triggers one meaningful deepening that narrows her stance from passive keeper to active weaver. However, there is no on-page cost or trade-off dramatized—no client refused, no secret reconsidered—only the decision to proceed. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (stop the tricksters' manipulation) is signaled early and pressure tightens once when Maya realizes the interference pattern and decides to act. The counter-broadcast is a meaningful escalation, but coincidence plays a role—she happens to possess the exact charts and training needed, and her solution works on the first attempt without tactical adaptation or visible cost. The protests softening is shown on-page, but Maya herself pays no price; no friendship lost, no equipment damaged, no personal vulnerability exposed. Agency exists but the tradeoff is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the key) is signaled early and Elara's agency drives each beat: she chooses to enter, to push past paralysis, to take the key. The organ music creates one meaningful tightening by transfixing her, forcing a choice to continue. The cost is visible—her grandfather died on this quest and she must conquer lifelong claustrophobia—though the resolution feels slightly soft because the tunnels no longer "feel like prisons" without dramatizing the price of that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy for Marguerite's sister—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elena's options; she arrives, paints, and finishes without obstacle or visible trade-off. The "unifying opposites" method is declared but not tested under pressure. Marguerite's disappearance and the sister's plea provide context but do not escalate into a choice that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (honor ancestor's erasure vs. risk career) is signaled early and coheres under a causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when journals reveal the predictions were correct and the exile was institutional suppression, raising the moral cost of silence. However, escalation is entirely summarized: "senior researchers exchanged glances," "journals yielded," "jet stream's shift validated." No on-page reversal tests Maren's commitment—she encounters no blocking move, no resource constraint, no conflicting loyalty that forces a trade-off in scene. Agency is present (she decides to rise and act) but the decision arrives without visible friction or a price paid on the page; the alternative (perpetuate silence) is named but not dramatized as a live temptation. The cost is conceptual (institutional shame, career risk) but not legible in a specific forfeiture or action at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hitchhiker's vanishing and its meaning—is signaled early and tightens once when the glass flake reveals the scaffold-map secret. Agency is present: the fiddler stops, searches, lifts the glass, and decides to carry the fragment forward. However, the escalation is a single revelation rather than a series of narrowing choices, and the cost is conceptual (commitment to recounting) rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The hitchhiker's vanishing itself happens off-stage in summary, reducing the pressure legibility of the inciting loss.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to sell the startup—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Elena announces the offer, Marcus responds with a philosophical counter-argument, and she agrees. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the "choice" to dissolve instead is presented as a clean alternative without dramatized friction or loss. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure; the train visit functions as exposition rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding ancient inscriptions via dream correlation—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara ascends the stairs, reviews journals, and recognizes a pattern without obstacle or complication. The telegram summons her, yet no tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The final decision to "write not just for herself" is declared rather than earned through a visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Escalation exists only as intellectual recognition, not as on-page pressure that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—undoing the failed spell and transforming cursed ground—is signaled immediately and drives every beat. Kaelen's agency is expressed through his counter-rotation movement, calculated shattering of the ice, and planting of the seed; each action forecloses the previous state. The escalation follows the accumulative lens: the vortex responds, ice cracks, curse loosens, shoot emerges. Cost is visible: his reputation damaged, his hubris acknowledged, and the acceptance that "failures had taught him more than successes." The price alters his self-perception at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the visionary awaits the eclipse of the covenant to fulfill her bridge role. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the future had arrived early" and she must act now rather than wait. The decision to plant the clipping narrows options—she commits to transformation—but the pressure feels ontological rather than urgent; no live opposition or trade-off dramatizes cost. Agency is present (she chooses to plant), yet the escalation reads as inevitable fulfillment rather than a turn that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake (retrieving her sister's spirit) is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation occurs through spatial descent and the warming card, culminating in the barter's completion when Elara releases the card and watches her sister integrate into the orchard. The cost is legible—"golden moments of joy that now existed only as hollow spaces"—and alters her internal landscape permanently. However, no on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; she moves linearly from entrance to transaction without a moment where she might refuse or recalibrate, which limits pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will remain insulated or confront his past—is signaled through the opening paragraph's public failure and his defensive fact-cataloging. The collector's message provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options to a binary: stay or drive to Elko. Marcus demonstrates agency in the phone on-off-on gesture, and the piece avoids coincidental resolution. The cost is emotional anticipation ("terror in equal measure") rather than a visible price paid on the page—no immediate forfeiture or consequence that alters his present situation. The escalation is clean under the Causal lens but the stakes remain more psychological than materially tested.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's drive to understand transition—is signaled early and deepens through layered reflection. However, escalation is primarily textural (thickening layers of analogy) rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The seed's opening reweights her ambition, but the transformation occurs without on-page friction or a trade-off that forecloses a path; the "transition itself felt like coming home" tells resolution rather than showing a contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving identities and wonder in routine—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or internal friction. Asa performs her duties "without fear of vanishing," and the identities arrive "as they always did with each tide" with no complication. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; smelting days arrive "as reliably as the tide itself" without cost or consequence. The resolution is not earned by protagonist agency but by the repetition of an unchanging ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Margret's professional duty versus the pull to honor the confessions. The pool hesitation ("heartbeat of a hesitation held her suspended") is the tightening beat where she registers the shells and their cost, narrowing her from retrieval-as-inventory to retrieval-as-witness. Her agency is clear: she lifts the pearl and commits to send the shells, accepting the bureaucratic friction ("facility would be sealed, preserved, forgotten" while she acts covertly). One felt cost: she will violate protocol to honor the messages, foreclosing her purely evaluative stance. The escalation is modest but earned under the accumulative lens; the pearl glowing brighter in response to understanding is slightly convenient but does not erase the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (path to self-forgiveness) signaled early and tightens through the graffiti encounter: "THE RIVER DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR FLOODING" and "YOU WERE NOT DESTROYED, JUST INTERRUPTED" reweight her self-blame. The decision to hold the bellows rather than play, then to map the station, narrows options with visible cost (she abandons the expectation of "sudden clearing" absolution). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Minor issue: agency leans observational; the protagonist receives wisdom more than she wrestles with a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. She follows the watch without obstruction; the door appears "at exactly the stroke of twelve" by coincidence, not protagonist agency. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the watch simply leads and she documents. The "infinite" final claim asserts continuation without demonstrating what she forfeited to enter.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—dream versus empire—is signaled early and tightened by the coffee-stain vision and the wisteria's story. One meaningful deepening occurs as the futures "fade at the edges." However, the bow-lift does not narrow options or show a visible trade-off on the page; the resolution remains gestural. Agency is present but the cost is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the spark before it fades—is signaled early but never pressured. Mira works "with lucidly watchful focus" as the spark "threatened to fade," yet no on-page moment shows her adjusting tactics or paying a price. The young man's backstory (musician, final song) is told rather than tested. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the capture succeeds as outlined. Cost is asserted ("weight of her responsibility") but not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: finding the source of contentment. The searching is signaled early and deepens through repeated climbs. However, the escalation is reflective rather than action-driven—no live option is tested and abandoned under pressure. The "hollowness" is told, not dramatized through a failed attempt or sacrificed alternative. The final insight reconfigures understanding but doesn't narrow tactical options or force a trade-off with on-page cost. One meaningful deepening is present but agency remains contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—helping others welcome nuance—is signaled early but never tightened or deepened by external opposition. Thomas's breakthrough is recounted in summary ("he finally cracked"), not dramatized, and Mara encounters no resistance or cost in her own arc. The dawn chime message ("something new is coming") projects future tension rather than delivering on-page escalation. No live option is foreclosed; the protagonist's agency is observation and preparation, not a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: Mina seeks the vanishing technique. Pressure accumulates through the ring sequence—each wave brings memory, scent, sound, understanding—forcing Mina from passive waiting to active participation. The researcher's warning that "truth woven carefully could not be rushed" establishes a credible constraint. Agency at closure is renunciation of passive stance; Mina's stone-throw forecloses the student role and accepts "the rest of her life learning," a felt cost that narrows options. The cost is more temporal/conceptual than urgent-physical, fitting the Accumulative lens but preventing entry to 7.5+ where a sharper trade-off would land.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and sustained. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist's mastery is presented as complete from the outset. The birds' patterns and the warming arrowhead describe her navigation but never test it with conflicting pressures or trade-offs. The resolution ("she had found something like peace") is asserted rather than earned by a prior choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final paragraph restates theme without demonstrable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to find magic that cannot be automated. The wards-die beat narrows options (system failure), the mist-walking deepens stakes by literalizing liminal space, and the garden arrival forecloses return to automation. Agency reads as acceptance rather than refusal, and the cost—leaving the spire, abandoning predictable duty—is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (mist acceptance) suffices under the accumulative lens, though a second micro-obstacle would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering "the color of sound") is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor flash and resulting "hush" shift Elias's understanding from active search to receptive waiting. However, escalation is primarily conceptual rather than situational—no live choice forces a trade-off, and the resolution arrives through passive perception rather than a decision that narrows options. The three-year vigil demonstrates commitment, but on-page pressure in this particular night remains gentle; Elias waits, the meteor passes, he sees. Cost is implied (years spent, worn key tag) but the final beat does not foreclose a path or exact a visible price beyond the understanding itself.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose through divination—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening occurs; Kira's process of casting coins and listening to static doesn't face opposition or escalate. The "realization" arrives without cost or trade-off—she simply confirms what she already believed. Agency is present (she chooses to continue her practice) but the choice doesn't foreclose a live path or alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to carry grief as a reaper—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the recording's emotional impact and culminates in the naming act, a meaningful deepening that forecloses aimless sorrow and narrows her path to purposeful collection. The cost (accepting a hollow that "was enough") is legible. However, the escalation relies more on thematic intensification than protagonist agency forcing a harder trade-off; the atlas and recording guide her rather than her wrestling conflicting options.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (cosmic imbalance causing fish famine) is signaled early and clear. One meaningful tightening: the mage's application of lukewarm-infused droplets narrows the crack from full fracture to hairline to vanished, with visible cost (hours, aching arms, thin magic stretched). Agency is decision and endurance; the mage chooses the modest persistent method over extreme temperature, and his faith in inadequacy drives the repair. The fishermen's return with abundant catches demonstrates the imbalance righted, with the mage's ongoing bell-ringing as the price paid. Escalation is textural (density increase via repeated droplet application) under the Accumulative lens, and cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the drowned town's memory against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara discovers intact bottles and her childhood home's walls, intensifying the urgency before other wardens arrive to "calculate what could be salvaged and what should be buried again." However, escalation is more textural accumulation than narrowing pressure: Elara faces no live obstacle or trade-off, and her systematic trail-laying proceeds without friction. The ending reconfigures understanding but does not foreclose a path with visible cost on the page—she prepares to present evidence, but we do not see resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early ("balance what she knew with what she felt"). The piece offers a single deepening via the starling patterns ("the answer she had sought for twenty years"), but this arrives as revelation rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live path; the transformation simply occurs as predicted insight. Escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven, leaving pressure coherent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elena's safe passage—is clear early, and the cold front shift provides one meaningful tightening that forces a revised heading. However, the narrator's agency is entirely observational until the single radio call; no choice trades one value against another, and the revision itself carries no visible cost (no competing option is foreclosed). The ending resolves through Elena's skill, not the narrator's sacrifice or transformation, undermining protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting to feeling) is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or pattern break that reweights cost—here the "battle" metaphor dissolves without tactical friction. The blade-touch moment is the sole pressure point, and it resolves instantly ("gasped, and so did I") without visible trade-off or complication. No credible loss (time, stamina, relationship shift) alters tactics after the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early but never tested on the page; no reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or forces a trade-off. Pressure is asserted ("mournfully eager," "delicate nature of the work") but remains static across all beats with no escalation or visible cost. The ending declares continuity without consequence, and no agency forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming dimensional homesickness and ending the wait—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the guardian encounters the pendant, reflects, and then walks forward without a visible trade-off or price. Pressure is declared ("the waiting had become something else") but not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is absent: no decision, renunciation, or endurance with cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—interrupting a stifling destiny through alchemical transformation—is signaled early and sustained. The piece traces Mara's successive-approximation method across eleven years, and the climactic insight (subtraction, not addition) narrows her options to one irreversible act. However, escalation is intellectual rather than pressured: hours pass with no visible cost or tactical adjustment until the epiphany arrives, and the final snapping feels like solving a riddle rather than a forced choice with competing goods. The resolution ("her hands empty, her purpose fulfilled") declares fulfillment without showing what she sacrificed or what path she foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—catching signals during perigee—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the "geometric silence" that grows and holds. The piece offers one meaningful turn when Mara shifts from trying to decode to tuning herself to the silence. However, this shift is not dramatized as a trade-off with visible cost; it happens through passive adjustment ("she reached for her notation device, but stopped") rather than agency that forecloses a live option. The final "understanding" is received, not earned through a choice that alters tactics or pays a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines—is signaled early via the urgent radio transmission. However, escalation is told rather than dramatized: the "terrible instability that made passengers dissolve at the edges" never manifests on the page, and Maren's decision to "stand at the intersection point" encounters no visible obstacle or complication. The merger succeeds without tactical adjustment, loss, or price; "passengers would return home to lives that had gently realigned" soft-resets consequences. Under the Causal lens, one meaningful tightening is present (radio urgency → decision) but lacks cost clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: completing the installation and testing the rational enchantment principle. One meaningful tightening occurs when reflections show her "doing things she had not yet done," narrowing her epistemic agency. The eruption ("a hum...from the space between atoms") deepens pressure by asserting the dream's autonomy. Cost becomes visible when she feels "the accumulated dreams of a decade and a half pressing against her consciousness," foregrounding a decade-long epistemic erosion rather than a single-beat price. Under Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase with a cadence shift at the eruption that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (learning edge-geometry navigation by starlight) is clear and tightens through Mira's hours of calculation. However, escalation is minimal: the work proceeds in "slow and meditative" rhythm without reversal or complication until the off-stage news arrives. The visitors' departure adds conceptual weight but does not force Mira into a visible tradeoff or narrow her tactical options on the page. The resolution—continuing her journey home with renewed understanding—is more thematic deepening than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt cost. Agency at closure is present but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is Elena's task to trace Margot's thread. One escalation occurs when the whisper emerges ("The atrium. Tonight. Come find me."), forcing Elena to act. However, the final beat does not show a tightening or trade-off—Elena "understood finally" without an on-page choice that forecloses a path. The phrase "to protect vulnerable voices" is told as mission statement rather than tested under pressure, and no visible cost lands in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieve notes versus understand Elara's fate—is signaled early and tightens when Maren touches the codex. The six-hour tidal window promises temporal pressure but never resurfaces to complicate tactics. The final choice to stay feels insufficiently tested; the claustrophobia that should create genuine conflict melts away with "the invitation to stay," reducing what could be a brutal trade-off to a painless merge.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding solace or wisdom after erasure—is signaled early, but escalation remains static. Mira's ritual drawing and the ghost's transmission unfold without reversal or complication; no tightening forces a trade-off. The architect's regret and Mira's anger are told rather than tested through on-page friction, and the final "understanding" arrives without a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: translate the dying language into something others can hear. Pressure accumulates through the elders' final phrases, the diamond's warming, and the birds' response. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs when Elara speaks and the birds shift formation. Agency is present but the cost is abstract—"had given everything" is summary. The curse lifting feels like relief rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path, limiting escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the cryptid research valid—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. Mira's progression is observational: she listens, understands, and steps forward without visible cost or tradeoff. The garden's response and creature's emergence are triggered by Amari's voice (external coincidence) rather than Mira's decision. One tightening occurs when the vines uncoil and gravity intensifies, but this complication resolves into harmony without friction. No live option is foreclosed; the ending grants cosmic revelation without dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and coherent. But escalation under the Accumulative lens is shallow: the statues begin to move, then simply yield. No reversal or deepening narrows Elara's options; she encounters no friction, trade-off, or tactical cost. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks a tightening that forecloses a live path or forces a choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—delivering medicine across the border—is clear, but the story never dramatizes genuine risk or opposition that would test Marcus's commitment. The phrase "official patrols looked the other way at twilight" defuses tension before it can build, and no patrol, consequence, or competing obligation appears to force a costly choice. The boy's mention of drones establishes an alternate method but Marcus dismisses it in dialogue rather than facing it as a tactical dilemma. The ending restates his established routine ("as he always did") without a meaningful tightening or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: finding purpose/completion in work. The discovery of the halo deepens rather than reverses—transition from routine to calling is gradual and textural rather than conflicted. The singing moment provides one meaningful tightening where the carpenter's emotional release earns the fragment's responsive pulse, but no prior on-page obstacle or loss tests this turn. The closure gesture (holding the fragment, planning the carousel) crystallizes intent but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclose an alternative path with visible cost on the page, meeting accumulative escalation standards but not the higher conflict test.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early but remains abstract. Miriam performs her ritual without opposition, risk, or visible trade-off; the scarf simply responds, the woman returns exactly on cue, and the reawakening succeeds. No reversal tightens options, no failure forces adaptation, and the ending grants recovery without cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it flattens into a demonstration rather than a contested escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing dreams leaked from old photographs—is signaled early and sustained through repeated vitalization experiments. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the runaway dream arrives and Mira realizes it is her own, but the pressure feels more like accumulative density than a narrowing of options. The resolution shows her hanging the photograph and continuing her work, an Earned Stasis, yet the visible cost (what path is foreclosed, what she sacrifices to settle the dream) remains abstract. Agency exists in her choice to paint the photograph, but the trade-off lacks on-page specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing the sealed idea—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through layers (arrival, broken wall, fountain, chamber) but never tightens into a choice that forecloses a live option. The locksmith encounters no obstacle, doubt, or trade-off; she simply works "through the night" and succeeds. The philosopher's sentence is a thematic payoff, not a reversal earned by protagonist agency. No visible cost is paid; "improbable longing fulfilled at last" tells completion rather than showing a price.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering his grandmother's stolen face—is clear and emotionally resonant. However, the piece lacks meaningful escalation or reversal; Elias swims to the ring, touches it, and succeeds without complication. No tightening choice narrows his options, and the outcome (memory recovery) arrives without dramatized resistance or trade-off. The ending gesture (planning tomorrow's expedition) adds scope but no felt cost or foreclosed path, leaving the stake resolved too smoothly for the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the children will trust and stay—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates (their cautious approach, the girl's defiant chin, the boy reaching for tea) but no reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The ending grants resolution (they begin to trust) without a dramatized price or foreclosed alternative. Maren's backward-walking and tea-leaf reading are present but do not narrow tactics or test commitment under escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder by planting the seed—is signaled early and remains coherent. No meaningful tightening or reversal: Elara moves from pruning to pocket to planting without obstacle, cost, or tactical shift. The heirloom seed's warmth and the prepared alcove remove friction rather than creating pressure. Agency is present (she chooses to plant) but no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The resolution unfolds as ritual completion rather than earned choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: releasing the bound spirit by unraveling the net's knots. Pressure accumulates steadily as each knot opens and the spirit grows luminous, and the reversal—realizing the net was a mask, not just a prison—provides a meaningful turn. However, the escalation is textural rather than decisional: Mira never doubts, hesitates, or confronts a competing cost on the page; she works "through the night" in a smooth progression. The final understanding arrives as revelation rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative, so agency at closure is muted and the felt price is indirect.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—interpreting the reopened chamber's significance—is signaled early but never escalates through on-page reversal or tightening. Elena's methodical documentation proceeds without meaningful resistance, complication, or trade-off. The decision to leave the chamber "exactly as she found it" is framed as wisdom but no competing desire (to excavate further, to claim credit) exerts pressure in the scene. The narrative declares stakes ("profound discoveries") rather than dramatizing a choice that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam discovers Eleanor's note. The tightening is conceptual rather than plot-driven: Eleanor's message reweights Miriam's career-long search. However, escalation is minimal; Miriam faces no on-page obstacle or trade-off during the descent, and the decision to find the daughter costs nothing visible in the moment. One meaningful deepening (the note's revelation) is sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the lack of visible price or narrowed options keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to articulate unspoken needs and be heard—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is thin: the ghost has called for three nights, and now Mira responds by singing, but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The "between lightning and thunder" window creates atmospheric urgency without dramatizing a tactical trade-off or forcing a harder choice. Agency is present (she chooses to sing) but the decision feels like the logical next step in her established practice rather than a turn that narrows options. One tightening (three nights of calling → finally answering) meets the length's floor, yet the cost—"unspoken needs found their articulation"—reads as thematic satisfaction rather than a felt sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether to intrude on Jansen's privacy or honor the accidental discovery. The diary's hidden compartment and Mira's choice to open it constitute the inciting pressure; the cipher's unfolding and revelation of grief/joy deepen her understanding in one meaningful turn. Agency is renunciation: she closes the diary, returns it with "nothing more than her usual brief nod," and accepts the burden of silent knowledge—a visible cost (carrying unspoken intimacy) that alters her stance toward Jansen. The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens, and the final choice forecloses confrontation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: proving absence is presence, that the sky remembers. The story deepens through cloud categorization and telescope use but lacks a discrete on-page turn or tightening that narrows options or imposes cost. Miriam's final understanding ("strings could be rewoven") arrives as epiphany rather than a hard-won choice or sacrifice. Pressure accumulates texturally without a pivot that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the library's knowledge before demolition—is signaled early and the ticking clock creates coherent pressure. However, escalation remains gentle: Mira finds the safe, studies the coin, paints through the night, and departs without meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The work proceeds smoothly without visible obstacles, trade-offs, or a moment where the cost of her choice becomes legible. Dawn arrives but the consequence (demolition) occurs after she's gone, placing the price off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—charting a discovery—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mira's observation, measurement, and cross-referencing constitute agency under an Accumulative lens. However, the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or cost: no option is foreclosed, no competing desire tested, no visible trade-off paid for the all-night effort. The starlings' dispersal at dawn is atmospheric rather than causal, and Mira's success is frictionless. A single deepening with felt pressure would lift this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (learning the rhythm of repair) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition. Thessa encounters no obstacles, makes no difficult trade-offs, and experiences no escalation—she descends, finds the mirrors, offers the gears, and the mirrors comply. The "sacrifice" of the gears is framed as offering rather than loss; we never see her hesitate, fear failure, or pay a visible price. One micro-tightening occurs (realizing the gears are offerings, not tools), but it arrives without friction or cost, reading more like exposition than a pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering communal purpose through the garden—is signaled early via Mira's messages and the whispered legend. Pressure accumulates (messages, maps, gathering, restoration) but never tightens into a trade-off or foreclosed option; the garden waits, the community labors, the bell rings, rain falls. No reversal, escalation under pressure, or visible cost appears: no resource scarcity, no dissent, no failure that alters tactics. The final act (ringing the bell) is enabled by collective faith, but the price paid is abstract ("loss of isolation") rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—to document beauty at the world's ending—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or internal conflict. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she performs the adjustment she intended from the first line without friction or cost that forecloses a live path. The clock's mechanism and the puppet are handled, but no escalation or choice under pressure emerges. Agency reads as ritual enactment rather than a decision that trades one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (rescue the lost travelers before frost locks the mechanism) signals early and tightens through the birds' escalating cries and Mira's descent. The nut placement is a clear protagonist-driven choice with visible cost: she accepts the inherited duty and opens herself to ongoing caretaking ("Mira rose to guide the travelers home"). One meaningful tightening occurs when she reaches the central plaza "just as the first stars appeared," narrowing the window. The travelers remain largely abstract—a woman and crying child heard but not encountered—which slightly softens emotional urgency, but the mechanical and temporal pressures cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—atonement and resolving guilt over her mother's death—is signaled early and sustained. The piece deepens understanding rather than escalating external pressure: Miriam moves from "guilt was not rational" to "the grief loosen[s]…a weight that has shifted." Under an Accumulative lens, the foam-tracing moment functions as a meaningful turn that reweights her stance. Yet no on-page choice forecloses a competing path with visible cost; she arrives already having chosen to come, and departure is uncontested. The insight is granted by observation, not wrung from a decision under pressure, and no secondary complication arises to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of story origins—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced choice or visible trade-off. The vendor moves through discovery without obstacle; her epiphany arrives through contemplation rather than agency under pressure. No reversal narrows options, and the "lull of opening day" remains atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint. The piece deepens meaning but does not escalate cost, leaving pressure coherent yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam can lighten the pavilion's accumulated remorse—is signaled early and sustained. The work sequence provides one meaningful deepening: she shifts from absorbing emotions to counterbalancing them with prepared dishes, a tactical change that narrows options (she cannot simply empty the structure). The cost is felt in her "sturdy brittle" emergence, though the escalation reads more as patient craft than high-pressure reversal. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her particular skill enables the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—bridging fractured community—is signaled early, but escalation remains conceptual rather than on-page pressure. The key turn (Antonescu agreeing to help) is told in summary across "weeks" without a visible moment where options narrow or cost is paid. No on-page reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade one goal for another; her competence smooths all friction, leaving insufficient escalation under any lens to enter the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding the mirror's purpose) is signaled early, and the discovery of entangled memories provides one meaningful deepening. However, escalation lacks agency-driven tightening—memories simply arrive as "understandings," and Mira's decision to become an archeologist feels received rather than wrestled from competing options. No visible cost appears: she gains insight, purpose, and restored mirror without forfeiting prior goals or enduring friction. The work "through the night" is summarized without obstacles, and the transformation completes without trade-off or renunciation visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: recover the forgotten combinations to preserve knowledge against time's erosion. The inversion tightens urgency (one-hour window), and Calyx's choice of the left passage narrows options. However, no on-page obstacle opposes her—she swims upward, presses the stone, and succeeds. The escalation is environmental (gravity inversion) rather than protagonist-driven; she encounters no reversal or cost that forces a trade-off. The resolution feels more like discovery than earned victory over resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and sustained. The piece offers a single meaningful tightening: Elara discovers the stress cracks' potential, constructs an instrument, and strums it, yielding unexpected resonance. However, agency is minimal; the insulator's properties solve the problem rather than a choice Elara makes under competing pressures. No reversal tests her commitment, no visible price is paid (time, stamina, social cost), and coincidence (finding the insulator, discovering its acoustic properties) drives resolution. The escalation reads as discovery rather than decision, keeping the score mid-band despite coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—sustaining purpose in exile—is signaled early and held throughout. However, no on-page escalation or tightening occurs: the tutor performs the same reflective stance from opening to close without a reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options. The piece substitutes thematic restatement for pressure, and the final image offers no visible or felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the ending merely echoes the opening's posture without reweighting it through action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: recover the locked diary's catalog of silences. Pressure is accumulative (the fireworks approach, neighbors suggest force, Mira commits to patience) rather than causal escalation with reversals. The single tightening is the firework explosion that provides the breakthrough note, but Mira's choice to listen rather than pry is static—she never wavers or faces a trade-off on the page. No visible cost accompanies the clasp opening; she simply succeeds. The reflection on empathy as "losing sounds" is thematic commentary, not a dramatized stakes shift.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens once through the corpse flower's bloom, which forces Kalia to endure rather than flee. Her agency appears in the decision to "breathe through aversion rather than fight it," and the harvest at closure demonstrates earned capacity. However, the escalation is durational (three months) rather than beat-driven with reversals; the flower simply grows while Kalia journals. The cost is conceptual (ambition reorganized) but not a visible forfeiture of a live option on the page. One meaningful deepening satisfies this length under the Accumulative lens, but the middle lacks tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering resilience's source—is signaled early and tightens through the inversion hour. Cora's agency at closure (leaving the artifact) forecloses exploitation with visible cost: she carries knowledge but renounces profit. However, escalation is somewhat muted; the echoes hand her the moral framework rather than forcing a hard trade-off. The gravitational window provides time pressure, but no live tactical dilemma tests her commitment before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding the freighter disaster cause) is signaled early and sustained. The convergence-point discovery provides one meaningful deepening of knowledge that reframes the accident as environmental design. However, no live options narrow, no visible tradeoff occurs, and Mira's agency is purely observational—she documents rather than decides. The evacuation and military return remain off-page threats without on-page consequence. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density but never forces a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("certify wonder as essential") is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened or tested. Yara lifts the bell, rings it, and wonder flows outward without opposition, error, or a choice that narrows options. The "sculpted hush" transforms smoothly into "symphonic presence" with no reversal, friction, or cost visible on the page. Accumulative lens allows for deepening through density, yet the story offers only additive layering without a pressure point that forces Yara to trade one value for another or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Kira's reckoning with failure and her role as keeper—is signaled early and sustained through the vigil. Pressure tightens when she reaches the Listener's Crossing, the site of her original failure, and the flute shifts from weight of failure to symbol of witness. The final insight forecloses the guardian-as-intervener path with felt cost: she must accept witness over action. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient. However, the escalation is entirely internal and reflective; no external opposition or secondary pressure tests her new understanding, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the vanishing stars and the halo fragment's arrival, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Maren's options; she continues her transcription work without visible obstacle or trade-off. The ending crystallizes her methodology ("endless transcription of questions") but does not foreclose a path or impose a felt cost—she smiles and her workshop glows, which reads as confirmation rather than renunciation or decisive change. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the stars' final vanishing does reweight the opening's condition; however, the lack of a visible price (time, tool, social credit, or internal contradiction forcing a hard choice) keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: understanding the pendant's purpose and Mira's absence. Pressure tightens when the pendant vibrates and Mira appears, deepening Elara's grasp of her mentor's lesson. However, escalation is dialogue-driven—Mira explains rather than Elara discovering through action—so agency is diluted. The "fade from memory to myth" frame accumulates atmospheric weight, but no on-page trade-off or reversal forces Elara to choose between grief and mission; acceptance arrives as realization rather than enacted cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is present, but the protagonist remains reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative lens. Pressure deepens when Mira sees her own reflection overlaid with her grandmother's, tightening the frame from documentation to self-recognition. However, the escalation lacks a live trade-off: no external constraint forces a difficult choice, and the realization arrives without visible cost on the page. The woman arriving tomorrow is mentioned but never dramatizes conflict or complication. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the absence of a felt price or foreclosed path limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—sending a message across impossible distance—is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal narrows options; the spinner sits, remembers, then decides in a single epiphanic move without visible cost or trade-off. The "latent sacrifice" is named but not dramatized: what exactly does she give up, and how does it foreclose a future path? Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does agency: the fabric "completed itself" and the edges "shifted...without her hands." Escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring life to a blighted planet—is signaled early, but escalation is summarized rather than dramatized in scene. "The awakenings came slowly" compresses months of effort into a single sentence, and no on-page reversal tests Cael's commitment or narrows his options. The first blossoms arriving "on a morning when Cael was tending his forge" places the payoff off-stage, undercutting agency. The story's quiet mode is valid, but the lack of visible cost or tactical shift in a high-pressure beat keeps this in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering her mentor's withheld truth—is signaled early and drives the catwalk climb. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kira sees her parallel self and realizes she has cycled through this junction many times. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed with on-page cost. The final act (lowering her hand, letting the shimmer fade) reads as acceptance rather than a forced choice under pressure. The coincidence that the shimmer delivers the exact realization she needs without complication or resistance undercuts agency. Cost is asserted ("no longer the same person") but not visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reignite the lamp to honor the drowned—is signaled by midpoint. Pressure accumulates through stone discoveries, yet the escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; Maren learns the tradition from Ashford and enacts the ritual without on-page complication or cost. The lamp's restoration occurs immediately upon her final stone placement, with no failed attempt or visible price (she retains the sea glass metaphorically but loses nothing tangible). No meaningful reversal narrows options before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—guiding ships to safety—is signaled early but lacks escalation. The three vessels appear in sequence without complication; no reversal or deepening alters tactics. The keeper's laughter and words succeed without resistance, cost, or trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should tighten through pattern break or cadence shift; instead, the beats loop without meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Yuen's contemplation does not narrow options or face a concrete cost; he arrives, observes the wing, and concludes. No reversal or tightening occurs: the grandmother's example and the donor's legacy are recalled, not tested. The piece claims transformation ("would return changed") without demonstrating a forfeiture or trade-off that makes the before/after legible with on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the labyrinth's sorrow—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through storm, moonlight, and vision, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options. The astronomer's gift and her nineteen autumns set up her competence, yet the final descent is intent without visible cost: no resource spent, no path foreclosed, no tactic altered by prior moves. Under Accumulative, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the cost here is conceptual only and not legible in a specific sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm—is signaled early and sustained. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through atmospheric intensification (silence, absence, dimming light) rather than causal reversals. The swaddling and singing constitute one meaningful tightening that changes the situation, but Elara's agency is ritual performance rather than a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The cost of "becoming less whole" is declared at the climax but not dramatized as a visible price that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will respond to her dying mother—is signaled early and present throughout. However, escalation operates primarily through temporal accumulation (three weeks, "still time") rather than a dramatized tightening that narrows options. The decision to write "tomorrow" is declared rather than enacted, and no on-page reversal or cost-bearing choice forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the recognition that "the answer had been learning to stay while leaving"), but the closure lacks visible agency or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: sustaining ritual care as a form of meaning and absolution. The stake is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through the season ("after the birds fly south"), the discovery of the bread, and the butterfly's emergence, but no sharp reversal or choice narrows options. The final act—breaking bread and offering some to soil—is acceptance rather than decision with competing cost. One meaningful deepening (recognition of absolution's tenuous nature) is present, meeting the length expectation, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is clear: measure the fading vows before they dissolve entirely. Pressure is present but primarily observational—she selects a slide, uses the resonator, discovers transformation rather than simple decay. The story offers one meaningful deepening when she realizes the vows are "not dying but evolving," which reweights her mission. However, agency is limited; the archivist observes and records rather than choosing between competing goods or facing a trade-off that narrows her options. The escalation is conceptual rather than driven by protagonist decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning her father's fate versus surrendering his watch fob—is signaled early and remains coherent. The false starts provide modest escalation by teaching Mara patience and market dynamics. Yet the final confrontation with the scarred woman introduces no new complication or tightening; Mara's question is posed but not answered through action. The story ends at the threshold of a choice rather than after one, and no visible price is paid on the page. The sunrise deadline approaches but does not force a decision within the text.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some carry weather—is signaled early but never tested. Seren's arrival answers the question through exposition ("perhaps because some people are already storms themselves") with no reversal or tightening. Mira's skepticism does not narrow options or force a trade-off; she simply accepts the answer. The accumulative lens requires a cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the shift is thematic assertion without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rectifying harm done to Elena's suppressed creativity—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The discovery of the unfinished portrait deepens pressure by confronting Mira with Elena's intentional remedy. The kneeling decision forecloses the path of avoidance and judgment with visible cost (facing complicity, the years of creative choking). One meaningful tightening is sufficient under the accumulative lens. The cost is felt but somewhat abstract; the final "I begin" crystallizes agency but the trade-off remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens through the map's revelation of coordinates and the phrase itself. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: fragments → map → room → thousands of letters → her師傅's pages. However, the journey lacks sufficient resistance; Mira encounters no meaningful obstacle between deciding to follow the map and discovering the room. The final act of writing offers agency with felt cost (she accepts the burden of continuing silenced speech), but the path there is too smooth to enter high bands for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the fragment's color and completing the sculpture—is signaled early but never meaningfully tested. No reversal or complication appears; Elara finishes the work, Juniper approves, satisfaction follows. The piece accumulates atmosphere but offers no escalation, no tightening of options, no cost legible on this page beyond the abstract "decades of listening." Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is expected; here the final paragraph restates the opening's mood without reweighting it. Agency is present in the act of tuning, but no path is foreclosed with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: the roses are dying from magnetic chaos, and Cara's static is unbearable. The controlled burn/miniaturization deepens pressure by forcing Cara to do "something she had never done before." Agency is clear—she carries the box, opens it, contains the fears. One meaningful tightening through the choice to miniaturize chaos rather than repair mechanically. The cost is visible (fragmentation) but the trade-off could be sharpened; the resolution feels somewhat assured rather than forecloses a clear alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the mailbox mystery and understanding its healing power—is signaled early. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when the locket reveals the grandmother-sister rift. However, escalation is mostly expository: Mrs. Okonkwo explains, Elena learns "through neighborhood storytelling," the sister reads and weeps—all told rather than dramatized. Elena faces no obstacles, makes no difficult trade-offs, and her agency is passive reception rather than active choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—escape and liberation—is signaled but never tested on the page; Mira has pre-rigged the solution and executes a rehearsed sequence without opposition or cost. The regime, the procedure that took her voice, and the cure she hid are all off-page; no antagonist applies pressure in this scene. The dance sequence is presented as necessity but functions as exposition of prior encryption work rather than a live choice with failure risk. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the water drains as planned, and she steps forward unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—finding her mother's deleted memory—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page obstacle tests Mira's commitment or forces a trade-off. The gravity fluctuations and coffee-ground navigation are described as solved problems rather than live difficulties. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mira's descent proceeds without friction, and the final touch occurs without visible cost (no renunciation, no foreclosed alternative, no price paid). Agency is minimal: the story moves her rather than her choices driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy that threatens the court's future—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the summoner's gradual understanding rather than escalating conflict: she traces the prophecy's nature, performs the ritual, and receives the warning. The ritual itself proceeds smoothly without reversals or complications; the wing lifts "not summoned but invited," frogs quiet mid-note, and the revelation arrives cleanly. Under an Accumulative lens one deepening moment suffices, but the absence of visible cost or a tactical trade-off limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (Elena's need to understand why she ended up in this building/life) is signaled early and tightens through the tutor's lessons. The meteor-shower interrogation is the key pressure point, where Elena's question forces a choice between comfort and truth. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a single deepening rather than multiple turns, and Elena's agency at closure (placing her hand, saying "I don't need to know") arrives somewhat passively—the tutor does not resist, buildings exhale, stars continue. The cost (foreclosing full knowledge) is legible but muted. No major mid-story reversal; pressure accretes but does not visibly narrow options until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother's disappearance and legacy—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates texturally as the whispers resolve into Elena's voice, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows Mira's options. The moment of "quiet acceptance" is a declaration, not a choice under fire. No visible cost accompanies the decision to find the other half; the resolution feels more like a mission statement than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring buried truth—is signaled early but never materially tested. No on-page reversal tightens options: the wall crumbles at Yuki's touch, the key's metaphorical function is revealed without friction, and the decision to carry knowledge rather than documents lacks a visible trade-off or price. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require deepening through pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the work proceeds smoothly from setup to completion. The final act is a renunciation (leaving documents behind) but the cost is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—learning why echo people exist and how to restore them—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through backstory of investigation and converges at the alignment, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice alters Elara's options; the universe's hum swells and she steps forward as planned. The escalation reads as atmospheric intensification (starlight shifts, seashell warms) rather than a decision under competing costs. One meaningful deepening occurs (voice "that might have been her own") but without visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—giving the nameless child her voice—is signaled early, but the investigation proceeds without meaningful escalation or tightening under pressure. Dream analysis, diving, and shrine work are recounted as completed actions ("had revealed," "had traced") rather than shown as live attempts that narrow options or force trade-offs. No reversal or deepening occurs; each step (collecting dreams, identifying the photograph, learning the girl's name) simply adds information without raising cost or foreclosing a path. The final move—finding the living relatives—is declared as future intention, not dramatized with agency or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and accumulates through observations of nets, father's fishing, water spiders, fireflies. The whistle moment tightens pressure slightly, converging disparate threads into a single recognition. However, the piece lacks a meaningful choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The descent to mend nets reaffirms her existing stance without visible trade-off or loss. One deepening (whistle召唤 fireflies, pattern completes) is present but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains gentle; cost clarity is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: excavate truth from competing narratives. The orchard keeper's arrival and the letter reconstruction provide one meaningful tightening, but both events are told in summary ("over the following weeks") rather than dramatized with reversals. Mira's transmission of findings and decision to stay do not visibly narrow options or force a trade-off; the factions' persistence is predicted, not tested. Agency remains observational; no on-page choice forecloses a live path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is implicit: validating prophecy/ancient knowledge against scientific orthodoxy. Pressure accumulates through repeated prophecy fragments and the storm's intensification, but escalation is textural rather than driven by Elara's choices narrowing options. The portico cracking and the prophet's arrival constitute a reversal, yet Elara is passive observer rather than agent—she listens, walks, places her hand, smiles. No on-page trade-off or tightening choice with visible cost; coincidence delivers the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the purpose of his sound-collecting—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. The music box discovery prompts reflection rather than a difficult choice with visible cost. Handing the box to the granddaughter is frictionless; no competing want (keeping it, using it for his own work) is dramatized. The shift from "verses for coins" to commissioned memory-work is told in summary across an unspecified span, not tested in a single on-page decision that forecloses another path. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not tighten into a moment where options narrow with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (preventing ice maelstrom, protecting the harbor) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the crystal's tone warps, temperature drops faster than predicted, and subsonic tremor threatens the resonance. Maren's agency drives the resolution (she adjusts the key in real-time), and the harbor's safety depends on her action. However, the escalation is summarized ("with each passing moment the ice outside shuddered with increasing violence") rather than shown in a beat that narrows her options on the page. The cost at closure is told (exhaustion, relief) without a visible price that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake ("patient revolution") is declared but never dramatized as a live dilemma with competing options. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Kira's choices; she proceeds from observation to ritual completion without obstacle or cost. The climax—releasing "ancient energies"—occurs without resistance, error, or price, reducing escalation to a ceremonial enactment rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will honestly document Thomas Wright's death despite institutional pressure—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: Elena receives the call, descends, discovers remains, experiences psychic revelation, and decides to act, all without meaningful resistance or complication testing her commitment. The core conflict with Chen is told rather than dramatized, and no on-page pressure from him materializes to force a costly trade-off. The final act (filing with backup copies) shows agency but the decision faces no immediate visible consequence or price beyond Elena's anticipation of Chen's reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to repair the mechanism as mere technique or infuse it with intentional blessing. Thomas's hesitation—"always step back, always ask whether the surface solution served the deeper need"—creates one tightening that narrows his options. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral: adding the inscription is a renunciation of simpler restoration, but we don't feel Thomas give anything up on the page (time, ease, alternate obligation). No on-page reversal tests his commitment; the woman's return confirms success without complication. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate through a second turn or visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (transliterating the universe's poetry to ring an unheard bell) is signaled early and sustained. The discovery of the arrow tip provides one meaningful tightening: it narrows the method and enables the final success. However, the escalation is more accumulative than agentive—the protagonist turns the scope and waits for the image rather than making a high-cost choice under pressure. The "bell that no one hears yet" lands with conceptual weight but lacks immediate, on-page friction or loss that would charge the resolution more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is established early: uncovering Yuki's disappearance and deciding what to do with the discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren learns the Prometheus mission succeeded and the company deleted Yuki to hide findings—this narrows options and raises ethical stakes. However, the final choice is presented as a fork without on-page resolution or visible cost paid; "began to trace" signals intent but does not dramatize a trade-off or consequence. Escalation is present but the closure lacks a decisive action or felt price that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to repair or reconstitute—is signaled and resolved, but escalation is gentle; the fragment's faces "form and dissolve" without narrowing Mira's options or imposing visible trade-offs. The final turn (using fragments to see clearly) emerges from calm intuition rather than pressure-driven agency. No reversal tests commitment; the ice softening feels like validation rather than a price paid for her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to face her chosen ending—is signaled early and shapes the volunteer work. Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: the "raw and evident" endings, the "particular weight" of recovered bodies, the ice's patient grinding. One meaningful tightening occurs when irony becomes gift in the grandmother comparison. However, the escalation reads as contemplative accretion rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options; the cost of departure is felt but not foregrounded in a decisive on-page moment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—coming to terms with irretrievable love—is signaled early and sustained. Yet escalation is missing: Elias begins in acceptance ("he no longer called it loneliness") and ends in acceptance ("quiet arrival of acceptance"), with the middle devoted to backstory rather than on-page pressure that tightens options. The piece offers deepening reflection but no meaningful reversal, cost-bearing choice, or tactic shift. Under an Accumulative lens, one expects density increase or cadence break; here the tone remains steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom through boundary-tending—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening. Mira encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and faces no narrowing of options; her walk is observational rather than pressured. The piece circles back to the starting state without escalation or visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the lack of a meaningful deepening or pattern break that reweights the stake limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—repairing fragmented history to enable collective healing—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Maren encounters no opposition, resource limit, or internal conflict; the photograph repair proceeds without reversal or tightening. The ending asserts "another piece of the puzzle had found its place" and frames healing as "practice," but no live option is foreclosed and no cost is paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here the reflective tone remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding the pattern of growth embedded in the library—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Accumulative/Textural means: the crystal amplifies mysteries, morning light approaches, Elias processes the pattern. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "the pattern of growth was not about accumulation but about completion," narrowing interpretive options. However, agency remains observational; Elias does not face a choice that forecloses a live alternative with immediate consequence. The crystal's return alters his stance but the cost is conceptual fullness rather than a trade-off that visibly limits later options.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the elusive sound of growing older—is signaled early and maintained throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sound arrives not as expected rust or ice but as the "almost-inaudible shift of a child's spine," reweighting her understanding and settling her tidal longing. However, escalation is minimal: Mira encounters no obstacles, makes no difficult choices, and pays no visible price; the garden yields its secret without resistance, and her alignment feels granted rather than earned through agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: how to capture the ephemeral without crushing it, rooted in forty years of grief. The seismic tremor forces one meaningful tightening—the narrator must restructure now, not later—which narrows options and leads to the camera's use. Agency at closure is a micro-choice: adjusting focus onto the spinning hand rather than the clouds, then clicking the shutter. The cost is opportunity: accepting the father's non-return and releasing the hope that stillness would bring him back. Escalation is more deepening than dramatic reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the single tightening is lean for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara executing a flawless goodbye for Margery while reckoning with her own mortality—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual beats. Pressure accumulates via Elara's method and Margery's gradual response, culminating in the wrist grip and mutual acknowledgment: a meaningful tightening where both women's isolation is reconfigured. Agency lies in Elara's choice to continue her work with heightened intentionality. The cost is felt but oblique: Elara's finite weeks lend urgency, yet no on-page tactical choice visibly forecloses an alternate path (e.g., stopping work, seeking treatment, addressing her own grief). The closure reweights the stake through shared recognition rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—find where shadows go at noon—is clear early. Escalation reads as pattern accumulation (one loop → seven loops) under the Accumulative lens, but no visible price is paid; each circle "clicks" without resistance or cost. Agency is present (she chooses to walk circles) but no live option is foreclosed. The "sealed awakening" unlocks smoothly without a trade-off or complication that forces tactical adjustment. Pressure coheres but does not tighten with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Elara's need to transform accumulated mistakes into something her son's replacement can carry forward. The choice to place the tooth and refuse identification narrows her options (no official closure, only personal gesture). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the tightening is internal rather than event-driven. One visible cost: she forgoes the ministry's resolution and accepts permanent uncertainty. The stake could be signaled earlier; it emerges clearly only mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnection to lost starlight—is signaled early but remains static until the convenient pearl discovery. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the pearl's arrival solves the problem it did not help create, and Elira's seventeen-year polishing practice is retroactively declared "preparation for this moment" without prior friction. The weeks-long sanctuary transformation is summarized rather than dramatized, eliding visible cost. Agency defaults to recognition ("she understood") rather than difficult choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: learning to heal after the mother's public confession. The piece deepens rather than escalates—three visits to the data center and the morning phone call add reflective density but no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The narrator's decision to "simply stay" is a stance crystallization (fits the accumulative lens) but the cost is atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture. No antagonist or complicating pressure beyond internal processing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming creative agency after years of paralysis. The encounter with abandoned characters deepens her understanding from mourning to acceptance, narrowing her path from avoidance to engagement. The young mother's toast-blessing serves as a meaningful pressure point that crystallizes the protagonist's readiness. Cost is visible in the years lost and the "hollow in her chest," though the escalation is more lyric accumulation than causal tightening. One meaningful shift is sufficient under the Accumulative lens; the final walk "against the current, not away from her fear but toward the page" forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restore the moonvine—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs when the golden threads emerge and the vine transforms, but this deepening lacks opposing pressure; no risk of failure, no cost if the song falters, no choice that narrows options. The harvest moon alignment functions as a timer, yet Elara's actions feel preordained rather than tested. The resolution is delivered by cosmic convergence and inherited knowledge rather than protagonist agency under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the heartbeat map ritual—is signaled early and pursued steadily. However, no reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara moves through a predetermined sequence without obstacle or internal friction. The arrival at the pattern's completion feels like fulfillment of intent rather than a turn that forecloses a live alternative. Escalation is textural (density of imagery) rather than driven by agency or a choice under pressure. No visible price is paid within this scene window; the cost is entirely backstory (grandmother's death, years of practice).

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding and repairing the timer—is signaled early. Pressure remains observational: Elira studies, infers, then decides. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the "wounded season's lull" provides time without urgency, explicitly removing escalation. The resolution ("repair…by redirecting purpose") is a conceptual insight without on-page cost or a narrowed option that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming into the pattern to release burdens—is signaled early. The piece shows one tightening: she chooses a burden, incorporates it, completes her section, and another silence-layer settles. However, escalation is thin; no option is genuinely foreclosed because she already accepted calcification and the grotto's terms before the piece opens. The final thread and settling layer deepen the existing process but do not narrow live options or force a visible trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs, but the cost at closure is atmospheric rather than viscerally felt as a forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: transforming loss into form through the carving. The piece shows one deepening when she touches the mane and recognizes "his face and not his face," but no visible tightening or reversal that narrows options. She ignores the kettle twice, continues carving, and picks up the chisel again—a loop rather than escalation. The cost of this containment practice is asserted ("the work was letting go") but not demonstrated through a forfeited alternative or altered tactic. Accumulative lens allows for pressure through density, yet the final paragraph's repetitive phrasing flattens rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: negotiate terms with her ghost. The camera wheel collecting fragments constitutes a tightening method, but the escalation arc is thin—Mira gathers stories, confronts the ghost, speaks, then accepts silence. No reversal narrows options; the ghost never complicates her stance. The closure speech articulates rather than dramatizes a choice, and the "exhaustion" endpoint feels declared rather than earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can she restore the terminal for civic use—is signaled early and pursued through mapping, calculation, and proposal. One meaningful tightening occurs when she identifies the aquifer angle and presents to the council, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment: the supervisors approve without friction, the carnival's departure is backdrop rather than complication, and no resource or interpersonal cost narrows her options. The final paragraph declares "stoic wonder" as the appropriate response, summarizing rather than dramatizing a trade-off. Agency is present but escalation lacks a visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and sustained throughout. The protagonist's agency is renunciation and acceptance, forecloses the path of indefinite avoidance, and the cost (letting go of the fantasy that finishing equals reunion) is visible. The accumulative pressure tightens through sensory accumulation (bear's arrival, sunrise touching the forecourt, the key in hand) and culminates in the winding act. No explicit antagonist, but the internal opposition (fear of finality) coheres and deepens under the Accumulative lens. One micro-turn (the bear's gentle presence models reverent stillness) supports without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why a canal was erased from memory—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: the realization that Konstantýn was complicit rather than a victim. However, this turn is delivered via summary ("she realized") without on-page agency or visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off enacted. The protagonist's serene confidence from opening to close leaves pressure static rather than escalating under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the weavers' philosophy—is signaled early and coheres under the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass reveals the knots' hidden logic, reweighting Elias's purpose. Yet the tightening is cerebral without a live trade-off or visible price that forecloses an option on the page. The resolution is a decision to plant seeds, but no competing want or cost tests his commitment in the moment. Agency is present but feels contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the geography of healing"—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece accumulates pressure through the traveler's reflections and the charged final image of staying, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options with visible cost. The missed ship is established as inciting lateness, yet the protagonist does not grapple with a trade-off or make a decision that forecloses a path; she arrives at a realization that "felt like the beginning of healing" without a dramatized price. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the lack of a legible cost or a turn that changes tactics keeps the escalation in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to destroy the Genesis Engine or integrate it—is signaled early through the prince's mission from his father. One meaningful tightening occurs when the egg's golden veins reveal integration instructions, narrowing the binary destroy/preserve choice into a third path. However, escalation relies on discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure; the egg conveniently presents the solution. The final stance crystallization ("he rose to his feet") reads as summary rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with dramatized cost. No visible price is paid on the page—only the implication of future burden.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving one can be a source of light rather than destruction—is signaled early and sustained, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; all conflict is retrospective (father's fire, her training, prior emergencies). The piece declares she fights fires "with graceful alertness" and names her compassion as "unyielding," yet no scene pressure tests either trait. The ending claims she "chose, every single day," but we see only one contemplative visit to the lagoon with no live decision or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure does not deepen; the piece circles the same thematic territory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the breadcrumb trail and the box's whispered emotions, but escalation is primarily spatial (fountain to fountain) rather than driven by opposition or narrowing options. Mira encounters no meaningful resistance, and the "unstick" process unfolds smoothly without visible cost or tradeoff at each stage. The ending reweights her skepticism, but the journey lacks a tightening moment where she must forfeit something live to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—faithful custodianship versus the gear's unexpected awakening—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the gear's ticking (a reversal: dormant object stirs) and Vael's recognition that "some part of its original purpose had slept within its teeth all along." One meaningful tightening occurs when the gear begins to solve for an unnamed variable, forcing Vael to reinterpret the mission. However, the final act ("knew that the next custodian would find the gear exactly where it needed to be") reads as realization without on-page agency or visible tradeoff; Vael does not choose between competing paths or forfeit an option. Cost is conceptual (mission redefined) but lacks the felt price or foreclosed alternative that would elevate this to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding collective grief before the butterflies depart—is signaled early and held. Yet the escalation is weak: Elara walks, reads, and realizes without encountering resistance or a moment where her agency narrows options. The butterfly departure functions as a deadline but does not tighten her choices; she simply achieves understanding and returns to the workshop. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off with legible cost. The ending recounts her decision to carve the epitaph tomorrow but does not dramatize the price of that commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—seeking absolution through ritual precision—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The pendulum's apex provides one tightening moment where Marcus allows himself to feel the full weight, but it doesn't narrow options or force a trade-off; he emerges as he always does. The story deepens our understanding of his endurance without a visible choice that forecloses a path on this page. Agency reads as sustained endurance (Earned Stasis), which qualifies, though the cost feels long-distributed rather than acute. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tapestry to understand the sovereign's intentions—is signaled midway but never tightens meaningfully. No reversal or escalation forces a trade-off; the gardener settles and decodes without friction, obstacle, or cost. The "unraveling threads" suggest urgency, yet the resolution ("he had received it") arrives as summary rather than a choice under pressure. Accumulative deepening is present but does not narrow options or impose a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—charting unknown futures through predictive modeling—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; Elara moves from contemplation to writing without a dramatized obstacle or choice that narrows her path. The constraint she places on herself (constellation of possibilities vs. single future) is declared rather than tested. The piece accumulates conceptual pressure through reflection, consistent with the Accumulative lens, but escalation is density increase without a turn. Cost is asserted in the final paragraph ("harder gift") but not made visible in action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving stories through pirate broadcasts—is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout. Mira prepares her broadcast "with particular care" tonight, yet no on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; she simply begins to sing as she has done before. There is no external opposition, internal conflict, or cost that narrows options or changes knowledge. The story reads as a portrait of ongoing work rather than a conflict with escalation and resolution scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring grandmother through ritual transformation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure operates via accumulative density rather than escalating conflict; Mira faces no external obstacle or internal dilemma that tightens options. The burning and scattering proceed as planned ceremony without reversal or cost that alters tactics. The final image deepens emotional register but does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off; the ritual completes as intended, leaving the piece in Charged Poise territory without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving truth against official narrative. The piece establishes intellectual opposition but lacks on-page escalation or a turn that narrows options. The chronometer discovery and sediment cataloging are ongoing work, not pressure points that force a trade-off. No reversal or deepening alters the narrator's stance; the final paragraph reaffirms existing resolve without visible cost—"someone will find these artifacts someday" reads as hope, not forfeiture. The accumulative lens permits gradual deepening, but here the ending does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preserving vanishing arts through patient teaching, signaled early. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through Eleanor's reflection and the young man's postural shift, but the tightening remains mild—his hands emerging from pockets and breathing steadying are micro-signals rather than a choice that forecloses options. The story deepens understanding of the stake but lacks a visible trade-off or price paid at closure that would push escalation into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving forbidden knowledge through gentle rebellion—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when Elena tastes the seed and the memories "explode," but this moment is rendered as summary epiphany rather than a choice that narrows options. The resolution (building a kitchen, teaching others) is declared intent without on-page trade-off or loss. Agency remains mostly observational; no live option is foreclosed with felt cost, and the ending reads as a manifesto rather than a hard-won stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city's power—is signaled early, but Elara faces no on-page obstacle or trade-off when climbing the tower or reading the riddle. The "drones were waiting" resolution is delivered without cost, resistance, or a narrowing of options. Mira's assertion that Elara preserves wonder tells us escalation has happened rather than dramatizing a tightening choice. No visible price is paid; the lights simply "flicker back to life."

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through displaced objects building "like sediment" toward recognition. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than causal: each observation deepens perception without narrowing options or raising tangible cost. The piece offers one tightening (attic shard discovery prompting cataloging) but no on-page reversal or trade-off. The resolution arrives through passive realization rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid—Mira's understanding costs her nothing and forecloses no path.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Thalassor's purpose as guardian versus witness. The alchemist's memory provides one meaningful deepening that reweights his certainty; his shift from "protection to presence" narrows his rigid definition of self. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective rather than driven by on-page pressure or agency; the diver arrives as a recipient of his new understanding rather than forcing a choice. Cost is conceptual (dissolution of "rigid architecture of his beliefs") but the price feels more told than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the structure—is signaled early and sustained. Maren's agency is renunciation-based: she stops seeking physical escape and accepts the staircase as "a space of infinite exploration." One meaningful deepening occurs when she revisits a dismissed formula, prompted by the chipped die, and realizes she had been "applying it to the wrong variable." The cost is conceptual (years of misdirected effort, the "vertigo of understanding") but not visceral or embodied in a forfeited path or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: decode the lost language and prove kindness is remembered. The stake is signaled early ("the lost language haunted her") and tightens when the daydream becomes specific, enabling her to read the symbols. The tightening is a deepening of knowledge rather than a confrontation, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is visible: she chooses to write and to leave the paintings. One meaningful turn occurs when the moonlight shifts and the daydreams sharpen. Cost is legible (loneliness ends, she finally sleeps), though the escalation is more internal than external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving dying arts under threat of discovery—is signaled early and sustained. The thaw introduces external pressure (voices outside), but escalation remains conceptual: Maren's decision to "bring their dying arts back into the world" is announced rather than forced by a reversal that narrows options. No on-page cost (forfeited safety, confrontation, resource loss) accompanies the turn; the bread delivery and lens gesture are symbolic rather than tactical moves with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unmaking her foreseen death by reversing fate—is signaled early. The yoyo puzzle deepens from simple toy to "repository" through Iris's weeks of analysis, but this escalation occurs off-page in summary ("Through weeks of careful analysis"). The final mechanism click narrows options (lighthouse begins dissolving), yet the cost remains abstract; we see no forfeiture of tool, time, or social bond that alters her tactics on the page. The hunger stone warns but never tests her resolve in a dramatized beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: finish grandmother's work by confronting fear in the funhouse. One tightening occurs when Clara unbosoms her true reason for drowning, but the resolution is more symbolic release than a choice with visible tradeoff—fear "could only hold power over those who resisted it" arrives as thematic summary rather than dramatized cost. The advisor's warnings and mirror reflections complicate but Clara's agency remains passive reception rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.1)
    No dominant stake is signaled—there is no problem to solve, no opposition, no cost at risk. The prophet performs her established skill without friction, error, or escalation. "To turn obstacles into instruments" is stated as a completed philosophy, not tested on the page. The "larger wave" at the end is incorporated smoothly, not as a reversal that narrows options. No agency, no tightening, no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the watchers and the expedition's fate—is signaled early and sustained through pattern-hunting and the forbidden question. Pressure accumulates via the spirals' changed resonance, the Council's prohibitions, and the watchers' patient vigil. The whistle sequence offers one meaningful tightening: Mira's choice to blow the three-tone signal narrows options and awakens the turtles, crystallizing a before/after threshold. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses a live alternative on the page; the spiral glow reads more as tantalizing complication than as a price paid. Agency is present in the decision to sound the whistle, but the consequence remains poised rather than paid, fitting Charged Poise but not yet demonstrating the felt cost that would lift this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to publish the letter—is signaled but never tested on the page through opposition, reversal, or a tightening choice that narrows options. The entire piece summarizes an internal debate already resolved before the story opens. No on-page escalation or deepening occurs; the final paragraph declares intent without dramatizing a turn or foreclosing a live alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren wants to transcend provincial survey work and become the "archeologist of abandoned dreams." The pavilion discovery provides one meaningful tightening—finding the inkwell and its inscription forces her to commit to this new identity by placing her own notes and carrying the artifact away. The rising water creates physical pressure and a ticking clock. Agency is clear: her choice to document and claim the site forecloses her old role, and the cost is visible in her wading out alone with "permission" earned. No antagonist required; the accumulative lens supports a single decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins and preserving hidden truths—is signaled early. The blackout and marginalia discovery deepen her understanding, but no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options with visible cost. Her final commitment is a declaration of intent rather than a decision under competing pressures. One meaningful tightening (pattern recognition) is present, but escalation remains cognitive, not enacted, keeping this mid-band under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: how to hold and honor her daughter's memory after the shadow detached. The piece signals this early and tightens once when Mira stops working for the basilica and begins private lantern-making, a choice that narrows options (no longer sharing dreams with pilgrims). The final beat—watching the dream, then folding another crane—deepens the stake by showing the repetition as survival method, with the conceptual cost (endless memorialization as the price of living) legible. Under the Accumulative lens, this one meaningful tightening plus cadence shift at closure is sufficient for this length. Agency is present (she chose to stop basilica work, she chooses to fold again), and the cost is felt. A second reversal or a more visible trade-off would push this higher, but the escalation is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some calculations resolve and others dissolve—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density increases through looped meditation, the geode warms, the circuit breakers cool. No sharp reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the piece accumulates rather than escalates. The cost at closure is conceptual ("bleak exhilaration," "the hunt that will never end") and felt, but the pressure remains contemplative and does not force a visible forfeiture or decision that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and remains coherent. The mechanism's activation provides one meaningful tightening: Mira realizes the chip is a key and acts on it, narrowing her tactical options to the star-alignment method. However, the escalation is more procedural than pressurized; no on-page reversal or visible cost that forecloses a path (she pulls the lever and succeeds without friction or trade-off). The resolution feels more like discovery than earned struggle, and coincidence (the stars aligning at the right moment) assists rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Maren seeking "the one truth she had never been able to sell"—is signaled early but remains abstract until the watch-hand reveal. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the discovery is coincidental (half-buried fragment), not driven by protagonist agency. The climactic recognition is told in summary ("every false memory...had been rehearsal") rather than dramatized with a trade-off or visible price. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric layering but does not escalate under causal or accumulative logic; the final image offers no foreclosed path or felt consequence beyond "some memories...could only be survived."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—releasing inherited enmity—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through reflection and symbolic setup, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options under duress. The exchange itself is cooperative and unopposed; the woman's uncertainty ("I wasn't sure you would come") deflates immediately without friction. The cost is conceptual (letting go of three generations' weight) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters future tactics, keeping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can she navigate with broken vision—is signaled early and tightens when she gravitates toward the shore poles rather than open water. The escalation is Accumulative: each pole passed is a small victory that deepens her realization she can find a new way forward. The current catching her and forcing a course correction provides one meaningful pressure point with visible cost (must abandon old celestial methods, accept terrestrial markers). Agency is present in her choice to launch and her active paddling adjustments, though the closure cost could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—kindling empathy—is signaled early and persists, but escalation under the Hybrid lens is thin. Vera moves through the labyrinth "with the patience of someone who had learned that rushing only led to dead ends," yet no on-page reversal tests that patience or narrows her options. The clippings reveal hidden text and the baseball warms, but these complications feel atmospheric rather than pressure-inducing; coincidence (traveler waiting, empathy materializing) resolves rather than the protagonist's choice. The final "jaded wonder" synthesis reweights meaning but arrives without visible trade-off or forfeiture. One tightening occurs (journey→chamber→traveler), sufficient for this length, but agency and felt cost are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—bridging death to reconnect with Korin—is signaled early, but no on-page event tests or complicates it. Lysara encounters no resistance, cost dilemma, or micro-reversal; she gathers spices, kneels, inhales, and succeeds. The transformation unfolds as a sequence of affirmations rather than a pressure-driven escalation. Without a tightening that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off, the piece remains in the functional band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—to recover lost time spent on magic instead of motherhood—is signaled early and drives the quest upward. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the protagonist discovers that "accumulation was not a place but a presence, not a pool to draw from but a mirror to face," which narrows her tactical options from retrieval to acceptance. The self-cutting with the saucer's edge constitutes a visible cost that forecloses the path of magical retrieval. However, the escalation lacks a concrete on-page obstacle or counter-pressure; the glade offers the realization without testing her commitment through friction, which keeps the pressure more textural than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early and tightens when Seraph realizes what the tear's purpose is. The stitching action creates one meaningful escalation: as she connects the photographs, the shimmer responds and brightens, and the dimension begins to open. Agency is present in her decision to stitch despite preservation purists' horror, though the work feels more like following revealed instructions than navigating competing pressures. The cost is diffuse across "decades learning to choose" rather than concentrated in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Mara's actions (walking, uncorking jars, watching) are observational; no agency-driven escalation occurs. The prophecy and eclipse arrive on schedule without resistance or tradeoff. No visible price is paid at closure, and coincidence (the detour, the eclipse timing) drives the convergence rather than protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering the communication network) is signaled early, but escalation remains thin: Elara moves from observation to discovery to decision without a single reversal or complication that tests her resolve. The blackout creates opportunity rather than pressure; no guard challenges her, no time constraint forces a hard choice, no tactical cost materializes when the lights return. Her decision to transmit the message by dawn is declared but not dramatized with an on-page trade-off or visible price that would make the commitment credible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling the grandmother's promise to learn what the eels truly are—is signaled early and tightens when Mira uses all remaining collapsed star dust in the Spiral of Catching Hold, foreclosing fallback options. The deepening occurs on-page: the sequence works, the eels gather, and Mira's understanding shifts from capture to connection, a protagonist-driven insight with visible cost (dust spent, old herding paradigm abandoned). The precognitive curse complicates but does not directly drive the escalation; the weight lies in the ritual's success and Mira's renunciation of control. One clear turn, consistent with Accumulative lens, coheres pressure to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will reclaim her voice—is signaled early and maintained. The storm's arrival provides external pressure and her decision to read aloud then write new verses shows agency. However, escalation is minimal: the vigil is framed as waiting, and her shift from waiting to acting feels more like elapsed time than a choice under competing pressures. No visible cost accompanies her final act (writing in mist that "no censor could black out"); the verses exist "only in the moment of their speaking," which sidesteps rather than confronts the censorship that silenced her. The tightening is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"whether knowledge remained a living process of discovery or calcified into rigid doctrine"—is abstract and never tested through on-page choice. The physical duel is summarized in one paragraph ("parried the first thrust," "their conflict escalated") without beats that narrow options. The "breakthrough" arrives via declaration ("he saw an opening") rather than earned escalation; the younger scholar lowers his weapon without visible cost or trade-off. No tightening under any lens: the confrontation is framed, summarized, then resolved by narrative fiat. Agency is summary-only.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating meaning in a place designed to strip it away—is signaled early and deepens through collaborative acts (sorting, sign-making, poem-writing). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira opens the false bottom, forecloses privacy, and Delphine reciprocates with her pianist confession; this deepening narrows their isolation and reweights the evening. The warden's arrival at 2 a.m. introduces a time constraint that sharpens the finality of "still working, still talking." Agency is clear (Mira chooses to reveal, Delphine chooses to compose), and the cost is felt (exposure, vulnerability). However, external pressure remains light; no antagonistic force tests their commitment beyond the systemic indifference already described.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring Clara's memory by playing the piece she requested—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story offers no meaningful escalation or tightening under the Accumulative lens: Elias follows a practiced ritual (gathering the reel, climbing to the roof, entering the arbor, playing) without encountering resistance, new information, or a choice that narrows options. The final act (playing the piece) is preordained and executed without friction. No visible price is paid; the "unplanned encore" is described as surprising fate, but the story does not dramatize any consequence or shift in Elias's options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (reclaim collective memory before the monsoon) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalatory: the monsoon looms, but Mira encounters no obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs en route. The seed awakens without resistance, and the "understanding" arrives as revelation rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible price is paid—she completes her work, the children will learn, stories will be told—so the Accumulative lens operates without felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the color of unspoken apologies"—is signaled early and drives Marek's study of compass and lace. Pressure tightens through realization (pattern changes with light, needle aligns with thread, final inward turn) rather than external reversal, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is present in the final act of pruning, a renunciation of the search that forecloses needing an answer. The cost is quiet but legible: he releases the hope of following Elias. However, escalation is gentle and operates mostly in reflection; no on-page moment forces a difficult trade-off between competing goods, keeping this in mid-range despite coherent design.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of imagery (butterfly's death, dust transfer, pattern spread) that reweights the stake—her need to witness properly—with clear cost: the burden of dramatic narrative is shed, leaving "kindled humility."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through the deepening discovery of frost patterns, which reweights the dominant stake from hiding to pursuing. The cost of this shift is legible in her transformed stance and the foreclosed option of continued sanctuary. Agency is clear: her patient study leads to understanding, which compels the decisive forward movement. The pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of translating silence escalates through Elara's agency in entering the hall; cost is foreclosing sound for new perception. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of giving rest escalates through Aldric's agency in listening to souls; cost is legible in his transformed purpose and the lens's restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes of survival under sanctions escalate through Mira's agency, from anonymous donations to the bell declaration, tightening options with visible cost in community scarcity. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increases, culminating in a reconfiguration that forecloses paths of despair.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Mei's agency, but the cost of healing remains abstract rather than a tangible trade-off for the protagonist.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s worldview—whether she will continue to demand explosive, dramatic meaning or allow value in slow, undramatic decay—and that’s signaled early and sharpened by the butterfly’s drawn-out death. Pressure escalates internally: the moment of the butterfly’s final dust, then the later discovery of dust patterns on leaves, progressively undermines her prior framing. The cost is conceptual and personal (recognizing her own “needless drama” as a loss), which fits the situational/accumulative lens but remains quite cerebral. The conflict never fully bites in a visceral sense, but for a quiet piece it achieves a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira remains a hidden survivor or becomes an active pursuer—is clear and her final choice forecloses the safer path. Escalation is primarily internal: fear erodes over weeks, understanding grows via the frost/ledger connection, leading to her decision to confront the smugglers. However, external pressure is mostly offstage; the smugglers’ threat is conceptual rather than concretely pressing in the scene, which softens tension. The cost of leaving sanctuary is implied but not sharply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully “translate” vanished music—is clear but primarily internal and philosophical. There is some pressure in her avoidance, then approach, of the performance hall, yet once she chooses to enter there is little resistance or cost beyond the risk of being overwhelmed. The escalation is a deepening of sensory/emotional density rather than a narrowing of options or forced trade-off. As a result, the piece has tension and movement but not a strongly dramatized test of her commitment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stake is Aldric’s faltering sense of vocation versus the souls’ need for guidance; the arrival of the package tightens this neatly by presenting a clear call. There is one meaningful deepening as he moves from undertaker of bodies to undertaker of lost souls and the lens repairs in tandem, but direct opposition or real dilemma is muted—he never seriously considers refusing or failing. As a result, escalation is more a gentle unfolding than a pressured narrowing of options, and the price he pays remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—sustaining communal hope and knowledge under sanctions—is clear, and the pressure of scarcity and “slow erosion of hope” is well established. However, present-tense conflict is gentle: the midnight runs are summarized rather than dramatized under threat, and tonight’s bell-ringing meets no on-page opposition or fear, only immediate communal assent. The key “tightening” is conceptual rather than situational: Mira moves from anonymous, individual aid to openly convening a network. Because there’s little visible cost or risk at the moment of declaration, escalation feels more like an eloquent reveal than a hard-earned test.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei can locate and transmute “unused love”—is clear and the breathing shift that reveals the tendrils provides a genuine deepening. Her decision to use the tear and camera obscura to capture and transform the light constitutes an earned, if gentle, climax. However, the conflict remains largely unopposed and almost entirely internal; there’s little genuine risk of failure or meaningful alternative, which keeps escalation from feeling truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure—saving the retrocognitively trapped photographs and fulfilling the grandfather’s unfinished experiment—does intensify as Elara recognizes the temporal anchor is failing and that only a new maze can stabilize it. The escalation is more intellectual and textural than confrontational, but there is a credible tightening as options narrow from curiosity to the necessity of action. Agency is clear in her decision to design the maze, yet the immediate price and competing options are more inferred than explicitly dramatized, keeping the stakes somewhat abstract. A single, more concrete cost or risk on the page would raise the conflict’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether this biodiversity cache can survive the regime’s transition and eventual surveillance—are well articulated and scaled appropriately. Yet on-page conflict is mostly historical (three years of decoding, eleven years imprisoned) or projected into the future (soldiers “will come soon,” she “will” plant later); in the present scene, once she reaches the bench, there is no serious obstacle or reversal. Her choice to defer planting adds a subtle internal pressure but is not framed as a painful trade-off so much as a matter-of-fact tactic. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening exposition than a live tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully capture the sound of trust breaking—is clearly signaled and deepens as she contrasts past work (hearing aids) with her present obsession. Escalation here is conceptual rather than dramatic, moving from problem statement to the realization that trust’s end is “a symphony of tiny silences.” The biological clock (“perhaps ten years left”) introduces time pressure but is not actively dramatized in this scene, so tension remains mostly internal and meditative. The closing choice—to persist in a possibly futile, deeply costly project—lands, but the on-page pressure never quite sharpens into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira successfully capturing and revealing an illuminated moment for this particular man—is clear but quite soft. Pressure escalates only mildly: the sun slipping, the moonlight threading in, and the choice to pour the jar and take the shot; there’s no real risk of failure or meaningful opposition. Her agency is present but untested—she does what she set out to do with no visible cost or threatened loss. As a result, tension feels atmospheric rather than truly tightening, which limits the impact at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether he maintains his protective “glaciers” or allows a thaw toward vulnerability and open inquiry. This stake is clearly articulated but only modestly escalated; the pressure accumulates via imagery and reflection rather than through a concrete dilemma or reversal. The small avalanche of ice and the transition of the glass into a “vessel” mark a meaningful deepening, yet no live option is definitively foreclosed on the page. The result is thematically coherent but dramatically soft for top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—Maya’s autonomy over her own identity vs Daniel’s control—are clear and emotionally weighty. Internal and external conflicts are braided, but escalation is relatively gentle: Daniel appears and advances, yet doesn’t exert concrete, time-bounded pressure beyond ominous presence and rhetoric. The key tightening is her decision to decode the cast in his sightline, which shifts her from pawn to actor and provokes his realization that he’s lost control. Still, the confrontation never quite forces a sharp trade-off or visible loss beyond internal pain, which keeps the conflict just short of fully realized intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—complete the map before the last star fades and the world enters endless night—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates modestly via the storm’s pause, the act of drawing on the final page, and the star’s final flicker, but there are no real reversals or difficult trade-offs; her course is never in doubt. Agency is expressed through endurance and focused attention more than contested decision, which suits the theme of “summarizing silence” but keeps tension low. The final cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping this in solid but not high-tension territory.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether a constructed mind can understand its own continuity—is present from early on and concentrates around the act of playing the violin. Pressure escalates modestly as music shifts from curiosity to necessity and the melody thickens with cross-timeline fragments, leading to a stance shift about selfhood. However, conflict remains largely internal and relatively serene; there is little on-page resistance or concrete cost beyond conceptual reframing, which keeps tension from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether genuine transparency and connection are still possible after words’ collapse—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when Mira risks touch and when the rumor draws others, forcing the registrar to answer with action (taking up the pen to draw for the trembling visitor). However, the conflict never quite sharpens into a felt dilemma or trade-off; he never seriously considers retreat or refusal. The result is a graceful arc with limited tension rather than a crucible that visibly tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the garden’s integrity and philosophy against a luck-measuring, commercializing world—is clear but mostly resolved in summarized backstory (the investors). In the present, conflict is low-grade and largely internal, centered on how Elara frames her life’s cracks as documentation rather than damage. The sole on-page pressure point—the villager’s arrival—is allowed to dissipate as she chooses non-intervention, a stance that doesn’t markedly tighten her options. As a result, escalation reads more as deepening texture than as a meaningful narrowing with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving the sideways nature of time via the velith-wings—is clearly signaled early and structurally fulfilled. Pressure does increase somewhat as the nexus approaches full power and she pulls the lever further, but the escalation feels almost frictionless: no resistance from ARIA, no risk to the specimens, and no real fear of failure on Kira’s part. Her agency mainly consists of operating the apparatus correctly; she’s never forced into a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice. As a result, the conflict reads more as technical execution than genuine test, limiting tension and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding Marco’s message before flood or circumstance erases the chance—is present and resolved, with the water offering gentle time pressure. Conflict, however, remains largely internal and comparatively unopposed: once she recognizes the code and moves to the piano, nothing seriously threatens her ability or will to complete the act. There’s one main tightening (realizing the water is revealing the notation and deciding to act on it) but no real reversal or cost beyond fatigue and quiet risk. The result is emotionally effective but low-intensity for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can forgive herself enough to act decisively in the face of another storm—is signaled early and tightened as pressure drops and wind rises. The key deepening comes when she finally touches the illustration, triggering a revaluation of Elena’s imagined judgment and enabling her to override paralysis to issue the forecast. Internal and external conflicts interweave well: the threat of repeating her past failure sharpened by real-time storm data. The escalation is quiet and largely internal, so while effective for this mode, it stops short of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—Marcus versus the weight of his own unsaid truth, under pressure from an uncanny environment—is clear and escalates from eerie sensation to overwhelming chorus to the hush before his confession. The ghost shift heightens internal stakes rather than external danger, turning the scene into a crucible for whether he’ll finally speak. The visible cost is subtle: relinquishing his guarded skepticism and isolation in favor of vulnerability, implied rather than dramatized in consequences. This is effective but remains more conceptual than viscerally pressured, which limits escalation’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how the keeper endures the endless accumulation of seasons and decay—is clear but remains largely abstract. Pressure doesn’t really escalate; we move from description of role to description of the refuge and then to a stable rhythm, without a concrete turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The regenerative silence could have posed a temptation to abandon witnessing, but that conflict never materializes. The ending’s “earned stasis” is conceptually satisfying but arrives without much on-page testing of alternatives or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—giving the children an enduring anchor of wonder—is clear, but the pressure remains gentle and mostly internal. Escalation comes via the eclipse clock and the children’s gradual attunement, especially Maya’s shift from distraction to presence and the charged stillness at totality. Elara’s main “choice” is how little to do (letting silence and the sky work) rather than a difficult trade-off under visible opposition, which limits the sense of cost. The final hand-touch is moving but not a high-stakes reversal, keeping conflict effective yet relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to dreams and whether stories can matter in their absence—is clear but remains mostly intellectual. Pressure does increase as Miriam’s account reframes the dragons and the dream-fuel cosmology, giving Elias “renewed urgency,” yet no external or internal opposition concretely resists him. There is one meaningful deepening (realizing dreams were fuel and may be gone by sacrifice), but it doesn’t force a visible trade-off or loss. As a result, tension feels steady and thoughtful rather than escalating toward a truly strained decision.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Elias will remain in self-chosen exile/orchestration or be pulled back into the old intelligence game—is legible, with the official letter serving as the main tightening. His choice to answer via fortune-cookie paste, without reading, is an interesting renunciation that fits his ethos of directing flow. However, pressure never quite bites: the cost of either choice is only implied, and no on-page consequence tests his stance before the end. The late arrivals hint at escalating implications but land more as atmospheric deepening than a fully sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Gabriel’s looming possession and Matthias’s attempt to intervene via interrogation—is clear, and the ticking clock plus the escalating density of chant provide some tightening. However, conflict is almost entirely anticipatory and internal; no significant reversal or concrete test of his method occurs on the page, and the boy’s screams remain background. The stakes feel high in concept but relatively abstract in execution, so escalation never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing a final, time-sensitive prophecy before mental collapse—is clearly signaled and does tighten toward dawn. Pressure is mostly internal and situational rather than adversarial, fitting the lyric mode but keeping tension relatively gentle. The turn into her last gathering of strength and the actual writing of the fortune is a meaningful escalation, yet the cost of failure remains abstract and never quite bites on the page. As a result, the conflict feels beautiful and wistful rather than genuinely fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can “conquer” the labyrinth of her fractured self rather than remain its prisoner—is clear, and the narrative pushes her steadily deeper into more painful territory. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and described more than dramatized; we don’t see a concrete, escalated on-page test or a moment where a real option is foreclosed. The escalation is mostly qualitative (“darkening,” “deeper”) rather than embodied in a specific wrenching choice. The final resolve to be the stone-dropper is thematically strong but costs her little in the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can puncture emotional numbness—comes through early and consistently. Pressure escalates modestly as she moves from observing Koren’s demonstration to actively engaging with the phonograph, culminating in a conceptual shift about silence as door rather than wall. Yet there is little genuine jeopardy or cost beyond the potential of remaining numb; no serious setback, refusal, or conflicting desire tests her commitment. The conflict remains largely contemplative, which fits the piece but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking her own safety to expose systemic corruption—is clearly signaled and tightened once Marques’s message reframes the quarantine. There is one meaningful deepening when she realizes her data already implicates the ministry, turning her from passive archivist into an immediate threat. However, external conflict remains mostly offstage (watchers never appear directly), and her decision encounters little on-page resistance beyond reflection. The resulting tension is credible but a bit too clean and cerebral for a higher-band conflict score.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mirabel will truly confront the emotional implications of her brother’s work and her own grief—is legible and culminates in her acceptance. The main tightening is the moment she uses the vial, which leads directly to the irreversible revelation in the bloom and forecloses her prior avoidance. However, pressure is relatively gentle; there is little on-page resistance, danger, or meaningful alternative path once she decides to proceed, so escalation reads as smooth deepening rather than sharpened conflict. The cost is emotionally real but somewhat abstract and could benefit from one concrete, painful trade-off or refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—remain human to witness or cross over and lose that vantage—is clearly articulated and threads through the entire piece. Pressure escalates as the beings’ presence becomes more immediate (the starlight’s learned “heartbeat,” the rope beginning to glow), forcing her to finally take a stance after weeks of circling. The resolution (continuing the pattern) is an active renunciation that tightens her options and implies the price of delay or possible expiration of the invitation. The conflict remains largely interior and philosophical, which slightly softens the visceral sense of risk despite its conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can pierce the hush and coax the world into “breathing” again through music—is legible from early on and escalates as her song accumulates and the bowl begins to vibrate. Pressure deepens in a textural sense as the music gathers and silence briefly “stutters,” culminating in the world’s tentative response. However, there is little sense of alternative outcomes or real risk beyond emotional failure; no choice feels like it could genuinely make things worse or foreclose a path. As a result, the conflict is moving and coherent but relatively low in sharp-edged tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera’s compound actually produces genuine feeling-transference and what that means for her ethic of half truths—is clear but remains largely conceptual. The main turn is her self-test and resulting realization that her “half truths” are in fact “whole lies,” which is an internal deepening rather than a choice that forecloses options or forces trade. Pressure does not intensify so much as accumulate; nothing in the scene truly threatens her materially or relationally, and her decision to continue the work comes almost unchallenged. As a result, conflict feels beautifully articulated but relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will heed the envelope’s implied obligation and what that might mean for the invisible workers it represents—is clear but under-pressured. The key tightening is her decision to act against her “cargo broker instincts” and seek out Elias, yet after that, opposition is minimal and things proceed smoothly. There is no substantial external obstacle or internal backlash to sharpen the cost of engagement. The result is a gentle, appealing encounter that reads more as discovery than as tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Yara can find a form of belonging that doesn’t erase her—is clear early and sharpened by the approach to the arbor. Pressure coherently intensifies from quiet observation to the risky self-confrontation at the tree and culminates in a consequential decision to stay and change her mode of relating. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative; we do not see a concrete on-page test where she must choose between old and new habits in interaction with others. The result is satisfying but a touch soft in terms of visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city’s rhythm/echoes—is legible early and drives Sera’s actions consistently. However, escalation is soft: the silences grow stronger, she travels, finds the chamber, and succeeds without encountering resistance, setback, or a meaningful ethical trade-off. The danger of disturbing the giant’s nap or permanently damaging the city’s timeflow is mentioned but never dramatized as an active, narrowing pressure during the borrowing itself. The result is a conceptually high-stakes problem resolved in a single, relatively untroubled gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stake—what to do with an unnameable, ongoing loss—is clear, but tension is almost entirely internal and low-temperature. There is one meaningful deepening when she uses the glass eyes and experiences the orchard anew, and another when the moon fully sets and the silence “holds breath,” forcing her into a new stance of acceptance. Her agency at the end (choosing to leave the eyes as offering and to return later) is earned and forecloses a path of pure instrumentalization. Still, escalation is gentle and more contemplative than pressurized, which keeps the conflict strong-but-quiet rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is existential and thematic—Maren’s desire for a form of visibility that doesn’t betray her liminal calling—rather than situational or urgent. The outage offers a hint of external pressure (“unusual freedom”) but never complicates or endangers her work in a way that forces hard trade-offs. The discovery of the tape is important but arrives without much prior tension or risk; she investigates because that’s simply what she does. As a result, there is limited escalation and no beat where she must genuinely sacrifice or foreclose an option.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will remain “rootbound” or risk transformative change in her life—is clear early and tightened by the grant letter and health diagnosis. Conflict is primarily internal but tethered to concrete external pressures (retirement question, distance from grandchildren, research opportunity). The key escalation is the shift from using botanical metaphors to evade decisions to letting go of control (leaving the leaf, accepting the vines’ self-reconstruction) and then calling Sarah directly. The cost is quiet but real: relinquishing her illusion of perfect timing and controlled selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need for rest and meaning, embodied in her quest for the telescope—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively soft. The exchange with the stranger lacks real resistance or dilemma; we understand the brooch’s value, yet the trade reads as an almost foregone conclusion rather than a contested choice. Internal and external conflicts are present (stamina, insomnia, value shift after the wars) but never truly tighten into a moment where options feel sharply narrowed. As a result, escalation feels more like steady accretion of atmosphere than a rising test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Varen continues to treat the future as territory to dominate or allows his worldview to be altered. Pressure does deepen (the pearls’ opacity, the sense of a living cave, realization of his smallness), but escalation remains largely conceptual, with few dramatized moments where he must choose between competing values in scene. His staying nine days is a decision, yet its tension and cost are summarized rather than felt through turns. The conflict is thematically rich but narratively gentle, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is largely internal and understated, centered on whether and how the archivist will find purpose for the valve and for himself after the exile. Pressure does increase slightly when the visions shift from others’ fragments to his own object, but there is no real counterforce, risk, or competing value forcing a difficult tradeoff. His stance at the end—accepting his work as “only beginning”—feels like a gentle deepening of an existing commitment rather than a tested decision. The stakes remain conceptual and low-tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria will face and articulate her unspoken truth—is clear, and it does resolve in the final scene when she uses the punch and speaks aloud. Pressure, however, remains relatively gentle: the arrows help rather than hinder, no opposing force presses back, and there is little sense that she might genuinely refuse or fail. The transition from being terrified of loss to achieving catharsis lacks a moment where she seriously considers retreat or denial. As a result, the escalation reads more as a smooth unveiling than a test that forces a cost-bearing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Mira will remain a detached observer or allow herself to be altered and participate in the tower’s deeper function. Pressure escalates as the transcription triggers increasingly intimate, generational memories, forcing her to reconsider both her task and identity. The main turn is her decision to add her own memory-layer, which forecloses a purely empirical posture, though the price is mostly conceptual and could be made more sharply felt. Conflict stays quiet but coherent, never collapsing into pure reverie.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will finally gain insight into what lies “beyond goodbye”—is clear and consistently pointed to. Pressure does escalate via the storm’s growth and the increasing instability of space, culminating in the amulet’s blaze and revelation. However, the conflict remains largely internal and abstract, with Elian’s agency reduced to waiting and then complying with a preordained moment; there’s little sense of risk, competing options, or genuine jeopardy if he fails. The result is a satisfying deepening of knowledge rather than a strongly felt test of will or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Elena will use her inherited tools to play the system or to articulate truth—is clear, and the external asylum stake concretizes it. There is one meaningful tightening when Darius arrives with a rejected application and Elena must decide how to respond, reframing the ink’s purpose. Still, the conflict remains largely conceptual and never truly bites back: we don’t see a serious risk to her job, legal exposure, or a near-failure of the application process. As a result, the tension deepens but does not escalate as sharply as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why the town went silent and whether it can “speak again”—is gestured at but stays abstract on the page. The only escalation is the hum changing “today,” which she dutifully notes without facing a new dilemma, sacrifice, or narrowed path. There is no antagonist force, internal or external, really pressing back; endurance is assumed rather than tested. As a result, pressure feels largely static despite the evocative setup.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will erased lives and the narrator’s own bureaucratically “nonexistent” self be consigned to forgetting, or will some other history survive?—is clear but kept at a low boil. The primary tightening is the discovery of the poison label, which focuses the abstract stakes into a specific, embodied story and forces a reinterpretation of what survival means. However, there is limited sense of options narrowing or of a difficult trade-off; the narrator’s final choice to continue their work is emotionally resonant but not strongly contested on the page. Tension operates more as quiet pressure than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core conflict—Elena’s drive to explain versus a phenomenon that forces her into personal, unresolved conversations—is clearly defined. The first hum and vision are a genuine disruptive turn that raises internal stakes by tying the mystery to her own regrets. After that, pressure grows more in abstract reflection than through new, concrete complications or choices, so the sense of escalation plateaus. The final “choice” (leaving without an explanation but with a new stance) is thematically apt but feels relatively low-friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Verada’s communal foundations will be erased by privatization—is clear, and the impending investor return provides a mild clock. Conflict, however, stays at a conceptual simmer: investors are glimpsed but never interact, and Mira encounters no meaningful resistance or setbacks while implementing her plan. The main “tightening” is internal (deciding to act and executing the graffiti network), which does narrow options but with little visible price. Consequently, tension feels steady rather than escalating, limiting the sense of hard-won stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—capturing the last untouched frost before it vanishes—appears early and is consistently honored, with time pressure giving the scene its spine. There is a meaningful tightening as dawn approaches and the exposure is triggered, but no genuine reversal or hard choice that forecloses an alternative path. Conflict remains mostly situational and internalized; Mira’s competence means nothing on the page ever truly threatens failure. The ending reads as a graceful completion rather than a test that exacts a clear, on-page price from her.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—repair the drone before the ship leaves so the package reaches its recipient—is clear and scaled appropriately to the scene. Pressure is mostly declared rather than dramatized; once Elias begins work, there are no meaningful setbacks, reversals, or difficult tradeoffs. His competence goes largely untested, so escalation is more implied by time passing and depot noise than by narrowing options. The resolution feels earned but low-tension, with minimal visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—validating the mythic convergence and marking it for posterity—is clearly stated and intellectually compelling. However, opposition remains mostly abstract (skeptical atlas community, environmental harshness) and never manifests as a concrete obstacle or dilemma in the scene. The falcon’s return and the phrasebook decoding deepen her progress but do not force a trade-off, loss, or reconfigured tactic. As a result, tension is present but low-grade, and escalation feels contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving Vellachen (and by extension neighboring communities)—is clear and present from early on, and the cost in stamina and time gives the conflict some weight. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals: repetition deepens into the first response from the stones, which meaningfully tightens the situation by making success feel close and failure more costly. However, opposition remains largely inert (no counterforce beyond fatigue and time), and Eliorn never faces a genuine crossroads where another path is truly viable. The result is compelling but low-turbulence, more meditative ritual than sharply escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—Marina’s physical survival versus surrendering her singular existence to become the vessel of a civilization’s memories—are clearly articulated and escalate as oxygen runs out and the temple awakens. There is a meaningful tightening when she opens the vial, eliminating retreat as a real option and shifting the conflict from physical to metaphysical. However, once the magic takes hold, her agency is more acquiescent than contested; the final turn reads as an almost frictionless acceptance rather than a pressured, actively chosen trade-off. The result is resonant but slightly soft in terms of visible struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will enact his father’s truth rather than collude with silence—is legible but plays out with limited on-page escalation. The main tightening is his movement from threshold “hover” into the chamber and his decision to voice the confession, but there are few live alternative paths or reversals to test that resolve. Pressure feels more atmospheric than actively constraining, so the cost of his stance is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—repaying the metaphysical debt by awakening growth in darkness—is clear, and tension tightens when the gardener finally perceives Elara and feels the venomous blessing. However, the conflict is largely one-sided and ritualized; nothing on the page seriously threatens failure or deviation from Elara’s path. The cost—the gardener inheriting a burden and Elara’s centuries of service—is conceptually strong but experienced more in summary than in active struggle. Escalation occurs through revelation and intensification rather than reversals, which works, but keeps pressure at a relatively low, lyrical simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes—creating a reliable, sacred route to the last spring for a drought-stricken community—are high in concept but remain almost entirely uncontested on the page. There is no explicit resistance from environment, magic, or psyche; her success feels inevitable, and the journey to the cavern never genuinely narrows her options or threatens failure. The primary escalation is thematic and imagistic (from wandering to consecration), not pressure-based. As a result, the ending is satisfying but low-tension, closer to a fulfilled prophecy than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to reclaim a severed lineage and understand why home was unspeakable—remains somewhat abstract and faces little on-page resistance. There is a nominal external pressure (the collapsed passage, the team’s abandonment, the ticking down to her “final night”), but these never materially threaten her goal or force hard trade-offs. Escalation is more a steady deepening of understanding than a tightening of options; the decision to carry the sundial up and restore it reads as an almost inevitable, unopposed move. As a result, the ending is resonant but not especially tense or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual (identity, memory, obsolescence) and declared rather than dramatized; the line “a letter that would change everything” is never tested on the page. There’s no tangible opposition—no risk of discovery, failure, or moral cost—to finishing or mailing the letter. The only tightening is the internal decision to add a thematically significant postscript, which is a soft, unopposed turn. As a result, tension feels low and escalation minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—anticipating and potentially unraveling a coup—is clearly established, but all antagonistic pressure remains offstage, leaving Elara largely unchallenged in the scene. The piece does escalate texturally as she shifts from documenting what is to stitching “what could be,” yet there’s little sense that any specific path is foreclosed or that she risks immediate reprisal by acting. Her agency is contemplative rather than embattled; she decides to continue and refine what she’s already been doing, rather than confronting a newly sharpened dilemma. The result is strong conceptual tension but limited dramatic escalation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will continue to live under the weight of her unsent apology or attempt a different relation to that moment—is clear and under steady pressure. Escalation comes through layered revelations rather than reversals: the message “Come back,” the shard warming, the spirits’ intensifying song, and finally the condensation reading “I forgive you.” Her core act of agency—choosing to evoke tenderness rather than her sister’s ghost or external absolution—is strong, but the struggle leading up to that choice is relatively smooth; there’s little sense she might truly refuse or mischoose in the present. The internal conflict could sharpen with one more concrete risk or competing desire to push this from quietly intense to knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is emotional and ethical: whether Elira will, and can bear to, reconstruct Fatima’s trauma via translation. Pressure rises as she moves from reading benign messages to decoding the Wolof, then hits its peak in voicing the bus sequence and the three-day orange sky, with Fatima’s touch confirming the cost and necessity. The external conflict is minimal and there’s no sharp reversal; escalation is a deepening of witness rather than a narrowing of options. That keeps the stakes a bit soft for top-tier scores, though the internal endurance choice lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes are internal (Mira’s ability to reconnect with genuine joy and meaning) and communal (whether the district can remember joy), and they’re signaled early. Escalation is mostly textural: the projection’s deepening colors, the dancer seeming to lift, the silent gathering of people, and the children’s participation gradually intensify pressure. There is no sharp dilemma or hard trade-off beat; the cost arrives mainly as the fragment’s exhaustion and the understood transience of the vision. The result is a beautifully shaped but relatively low-conflict arc, fitting for the mode but short of higher-band tension and visible prices paid through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Elena’s relationship to her craft and to this anomalous space: whether she will treat the fresco as a static object or a living exchange. Pressure escalates gently through the coin’s discovery and the subsequent strangeness of the echoes, culminating in her conceptual shift. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and low-friction; no meaningful external obstacle or hard trade-off tests her new stance. The result is thematically satisfying but low-intensity in terms of stakes and felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—plant the Untaxable seed without alerting the thought-tax apparatus—is clear, but the pressure escalates only modestly. The drone pass provides a single tension spike, yet it resolves quickly and without visible cost, and Maren never faces a genuine risk of failure on the page. Internal and external conflicts are more declared than tested; her desperation and the seed’s importance are told, but no choice forces her to sacrifice or improvise under fire. The result is a conceptually high-stakes situation rendered with too much safety to fully satisfy on a conflict axis.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether she can endure the seemingly endless wait without breaking—is clear, and the tension between breaking and continuing is thematically potent. Pressure does accumulate via the postcard’s trembling and her response of writing faster, which constitutes a modest tightening. However, the conflict stays predominantly internal and descriptive; there is no sharp on-page test or reversal that markedly narrows her options. The piece succeeds as a lyric endurance portrait but doesn’t fully exploit its own stakes for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how extinct feelings and forgotten names can be preserved—is clear but largely static. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than via concrete obstacles; her rounds proceed smoothly, without a moment where the work is genuinely threatened or her commitment tested. The closest thing to escalation is the mid-story articulation of what regret means to her, which reframes the duty but doesn’t narrow options. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative and atmospheric rather than gripping, suitable for lyric work but below top-tier story pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—decoding the prophecy without betraying its truth-logic and re-opening the bond with Elian—are clear and intertwined. Pressure escalates as she moves from contemplation to the irrevocable act of writing the final passage, and the door opening with Elian’s arrival provides a meaningful tightening. However, conflict remains mostly internal and smooth; there’s no true reversal or hard trade-off where she loses something tangible or forecloses a visible alternative path. The result is tense and satisfying but relatively low-friction compared to the loftiness of the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes are internal (grief versus duty) braided with situational risk (unstable volcano, endangered villages); both are clearly signaled. Pressure deepens as the spectroscopic analysis reveals the father’s deliberate self-removal and dangerous work, forcing Elara to reinterpret his disappearance and decide whether to step into that danger. Escalation is more conceptual than dramatic, so the sense of risk is somewhat muted, but the choice to continue his work still forecloses the easier path of withdrawal. The tremors and reminder that dormancy is temporary add a light external squeeze that supports, rather than drives, the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will re-open herself to sending/receiving messages after trauma—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates as her method coalesces and culminates in the high-stakes, if quiet, moment of actually playing the first recording. The cost of exposure to inherited grief and the risk of hoping again are implicit but not dramatized through a sharp on-page dilemma or reversal. The piece earns its gentle cadence, yet the conflict never quite tightens to a point where she must visibly trade one live option for another.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cross a sacred threshold to reach her mother and reframe her sense of boundaries—is clear and thematically coherent. Pressure escalates via conceptual deepening (realizing the terrace is following flight paths, reinterpreting the codes) rather than overt obstacles, and the key tightening is the recognition that the true threshold is the moment of choosing. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and fairly smooth; there’s little sense that a real option is being foreclosed or that violating the boundary would have tangible cost beyond conceptual transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marek can find a meaningful form of belonging in continuity with the past researchers—is signaled early and carried through. Pressure accumulates via the limited time before flooding and his need to “add his own observation,” but escalation is subtle and largely internal. His main act of agency is arranging the feather and waiting, then accepting a reframed understanding rather than confronting a difficult trade-off. The tension fits the lyric mode but never quite tightens into a true crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the fisher can bear and in some sense reconfigure his son’s disappearance—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates as Maren moves from routine reading into the troubling “gaps,” and her push deeper into the glass is a credible tightening. However, the conflict remains relatively low-intensity and largely internal; Maren’s ethical dilemma about *how* to tell him is more implied than fully dramatized as a sharp choice. The ending costs are present but somewhat softened by the hopeful inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are the weakest area: nothing substantial resists Marek, and his success with the crowd is never in doubt. The “stakes” are essentially whether he can briefly transform the ordinary night, but this is neither threatened nor altered as the scene unfolds. There’s no meaningful tightening or reversal; his method is described and then serenely executed. Without a live option foreclosed or a visible price paid, tension stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—how she will relate to exile and memory—is signaled, but pressure remains gentle and largely internal. The primary act (writing the verse) feels foregone rather than a contested decision, so escalation reads more as deepening description than narrowing options. The key “turn” is the realization that exile is arrival and the dissolution of her anchor, but this is not strongly contested on the page. As a result, the piece has tension in concept but limited felt stakes or genuine risk in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict here is almost entirely internal and low-pressure: the stake is her desire to maintain a way of seeing the world before the workday’s demands intrude. The only structural tightening is the encroaching dawn and the boat engine, which signal the end of her contemplative interval but don’t materially constrain a choice or demand a trade-off. She endures rather than decides, and no option is truly foreclosed. As a result, tension feels meditative rather than escalatory, limiting the category’s strength.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Mira lives with the cost of choosing the fire line over Elena—is clear and morally charged. Pressure is mostly internal, with the annual trek and opening of the box acting as a mild tightening that leads to her spoken credo. However, there’s little on-page escalation; she arrives already having made peace with her role, and the scene confirms it rather than pushing her to a new, riskier choice. The cost is legible but not newly sharpened by an active dilemma in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract: the “stakes” are the understanding of hope and human potential, but no concrete risk, opposition, or hard trade-off manifests in scene. There is no real escalation—no failed experiment that forces a new tactic, no branch where a version of Elara pays a visible price. The rising tide and acknowledgment that some timelines show failure hint at pressure, yet nothing meaningfully tightens her options or demands sacrifice. The result is thematically rich but dramatically underpowered.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—salvaging and interpreting vanishing echoes/diaries before they dissolve—is clear but mostly intellectual and atmospheric. Pressure modestly tightens through the damage to the diaries and fading light, culminating in the partial recovery of Ashworth’s chart. There’s little in the way of direct opposition or hard trade-offs; Mira’s success costs her mainly a deeper acceptance of the burden rather than a visible sacrifice. As a result, conflict feels gently textured rather than truly escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict and stakes are largely implied and internal; there is no antagonist, and nothing threatens to prevent her from achieving her aim. The closest thing to escalation is the gradual intensification of her song and the mirrors’ transformation, cued against the approaching bells. Her agency is real—she chooses to come, to sing, to depart—but none of these actions seem risky or costly, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, tension is low and the scene reads more as an elegant vignette than as a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether these leaders will move even a step toward ending a generational war—is clear from early on and remains focused. The pressure deepens as Maren exposes her own loss and reads the dead into the scene, prompting Varen’s confession and Sera’s softening, culminating in the handshake. However, escalation is largely emotional and tonal, with no concrete tactical or moral choke point forced on the characters; the negotiation feels almost too smooth for the level of entrenched hatred described. The cost is more conceptual (accepting an incomplete, ongoing struggle) than dramatically felt in a single sharpened choice, keeping stakes effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will enact this morally fraught resurrection despite the collateral damage—is clear and morally charged. However, most of the conflict is summarized history; in the present scene, tangible resistance (internal or external) barely escalates beyond the ticking weather window. Thunder and approaching storms hint at a clock, but she never seriously wavers or adapts tactics under pressure. As a result, the piece reads more as a solemn culmination than a scene of live, tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—remaining awake and self-possessed versus surrendering to the lullaby of conformity—is clear but not strongly pressured on the page. Her work at the fountain deepens her commitment, yet there is little escalation in terms of risk, opposition, or narrowing options; no one can interrupt or punish her, and she seems fully aligned with her goal from the outset. As a result, the piece reads as a beautiful affirmation rather than a conflict that tightens toward a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can revise his relationship to storytelling ethics—is clear but kept mostly internal and contemplative. The key escalatory move is his decision to reverse the story, which deepens the pressure around ownership and completion of narratives. However, the primary conflict (with Mira) is already in the past, so on-page tension rarely tightens beyond meditative experimentation. The price of his new stance is intellectually present but not strongly dramatized through concrete loss or a live test that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether the last monarch can find shelter and continue its journey—tightens well when the wind disrupts both Elara’s work and the butterfly’s path. The reversal (lattice destroyed, trajectory threatened) is clear, and her rapid re-knotting into a rescue signal is a satisfying, agency-driven response. However, her extreme competence and lack of serious doubt keep the pressure from feeling truly risky or costly; success feels almost inevitable once she acts. The cost is primarily the loss of three days’ work, which she accepts with little on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain in frozen, self-punishing stasis or re-engage by transforming the sanctum into a living archive—is clear and coherent. Pressure deepens as she commits to the painstaking rebraiding through cold and exhaustion, culminating in the rope’s hum and her choice to step back toward the world. However, escalation is relatively gentle; the piece lacks a sharp on-page test where she might falter or choose differently, so tension feels meditative instead of truly tightening. The cost is implied (leaving her isolation, accepting imperfect remembrance) rather than dramatized through a concrete dilemma or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stakes—use the directive before it decays and reach the threshold—are clear, but they remain mostly abstract. Pressure rises somewhat via the approaching storm and the bunker’s awakening, yet Foresight never faces a genuine dilemma or trade-off; she simply proceeds successfully. The main “turn” is an internal realization about the directive’s nature, which doesn’t visibly foreclose an option on the page. The lack of a felt or dramatized price keeps tension functional rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maruk will reassert the covenant and thus shape the palace’s fate under the new regime—is clear, and the ticking clock of the dawn arrival provides a modest tightening. His choice to perform the ritual is an earned escalation of commitment, and it does reweight the future of the city. Still, external resistance is minimal and the ritual succeeds without friction, so the sense of risk or sacrifice never fully sharpens. The conflict remains more contemplative than pressured, limiting the felt stakes for a high-end short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Mira must convince a hostile, half-untethered brother to let go of resentment to prevent further unraveling—remains focused and coherent. Escalation is primarily accumulative/textural: the sanctuary’s increasingly violent shifts mirror rising emotional stakes until everything stills at Kael’s decision. However, Kael’s reversal feels slightly swift and low-friction for the magnitude of the grievance and world-scale stakes. The cost of his choice is more implied (surrendering a defining grievance) than fully dramatized in his struggle leading up to it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can create a mirror that captures the astronomer’s fugitive dream—is clear but remains almost entirely abstract and unopposed. The only real tightening is temporal/tonal: the “shimmer of twilight frost” and the long night of work, yet no concrete setback or tough choice alters her tactics. As a result, pressure feels low, and the successful glimpse of the mountains arrives without having been truly in doubt. The conflict is more meditative process than tested struggle, limiting escalation and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can meaningfully repair the statue and, by extension, her broken promise and relationship—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through her choice to unpack the bag and commit to the painstaking repair, then tightens when the repair is complete but she realizes tools alone can’t mend the deeper breach, capped by the daughter’s silhouette as a new test. The cost (years of distance, the risk of reaching out again) is implied rather than dramatized in confrontation, so the conflict stays relatively interior and quiet. That quiet works, but a slightly sharper on-page test of her new stance could deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will accept and unlock the “forbidden knowledge” of her inheritance—is signaled and carried through, with her act of asking the question as the main turn. Pressure does increase modestly as she retreats, reflects, and feels the inquiry “rise” in her, culminating in the cameo’s activation. Yet the conflict remains largely internal and abstract; there is little sense of a live alternative (refusal, delay, or real danger) at the moment of choice. Because no tangible cost or risk manifests when she acts, escalation feels intellectually interesting but emotionally low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how humanity can renegotiate access to abandoned knowledge—is clear but remains largely abstract and untested in scene. Pressure increases slightly as Elara discovers the time traveler’s failed bargain and understands her own higher-stakes mandate, but there is no concrete setback or forced trade-off within the story’s window. The rescue “mission” is mostly preparatory; she descends toward, rather than into, the real conflict. As a result, escalation under the chosen accumulative lens feels more like deepening premise than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s attempt to recapture a lost, shared self and reach the garden of forgotten names—is clear but remains largely internal and anticipatory. Pressure does increase somewhat as the fog thins and her brother’s voice clarifies, culminating in her stepping forward with the card. Still, there’s minimal resistance or genuine dilemma; no option is sharply foreclosed, and the cost of continuing vs. turning back is not tested. The result is a beautiful mood piece with limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the impossible door—is clearly signaled and does intensify as Elena moves from theory to manipulation of the rope. However, there is no real resistance, risk, or competing demand; every step works on the first try without setback or ethical tension. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling than pressure that forces hard choices or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—find a pocket of absolute silence that the energy beings cannot enter—is clear and present early, and the pressure tightens as she recognizes the spiral and commits to using the stone and her own voice. Escalation is primarily conceptual/textural (rising hum, focused attention, recognition of non-damage) rather than adversarial; there’s no direct on-page interference from the beings, which keeps tension more meditative than urgent. Her use of a sacred relic and the physical/emotional toll of constant resonance supply some cost, but we never see a real possibility of failure or a hard trade-off tested in scene. The result is beautifully coherent but somewhat low on concrete reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are mostly thematic and aspirational—rekindling connection and proving coincidences have meaning—rather than sharply dramatized as risks or trade-offs in scene. There is minimal active opposition: no environmental hazard to the climb, no counter-impulse that seriously tempts her to leave the shard untouched or abandon the beacon. The primary “tightening” is her realization that this is the moment her gift has been preparing her for, which deepens significance but doesn’t materially narrow options. As a result, pressure feels static and the decision carries limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes center on whether and how she can meaningfully witness and record collective memory, but these remain abstract and largely untested. The only real tightening is the storm’s intensification followed by the discovery of the anomalous monument shadow, which prompts deeper reflection but not a pressured trade-off or foreclosed option. Her decision to write is continuous with her role and unopposed, so tension never truly escalates. As a result, the piece is strong as a lyric meditation but light on conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—re-igniting hope in a starless world—is clear, but on the page it faces little concrete resistance. Preparation goes smoothly; there’s no material scarcity, danger, or genuine risk of failure dramatized, so escalation is more procedural than pressured. The meaningful tightening is essentially the decision to respond to the mosaic’s challenge by acting rather than leaving, which is conceptually strong but under-tested. This keeps the conflict from achieving higher-band sharpness despite the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the sisters can re-enter relationship after a three-year silence—is legible and emotionally weighty. However, most of the story inhabits a single static pause, with the main turn occurring only when Mira places the cicada down and her sister answers. This produces a gentle deepening rather than a sharp escalation; options never feel significantly narrowed or riskier as the scene proceeds. The off-page argument and lack of on-page friction beyond silence keep tension from cresting as strongly as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal, centering on Mira’s relationship to confinement and exposure, with gravity’s one-hour inversion nominally adding time pressure. The “clock” and the danger of open height are underused as active forces; she never has to make a truly costly, time-squeezed decision in response to them. The main tightening is her awareness of gravity returning, which nudges her into crystallizing her new stance, but the escalation from curiosity to resolution stays gentle. The piece is emotionally engaging yet could sustain more palpable pressure or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Maren can transform threatening silence into comfort for the boy—is clear and specific, and the storm glass’s violet turbulence offers a concrete pressure cue. There is one main tightening beat when she chooses to extend the route and commit to the intervention. However, the outcome never feels in serious doubt, and there’s little sense of competing goods or visible sacrifice beyond time. Conflict is elegantly handled but remains gentle and low-friction, limiting suspense and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (reach and claim the Unclaimed Throne/stairway before the dimensional window closes) is clearly signaled. Yet on the page, pressure hardly tightens: there are no real obstacles, reversals, or meaningful decisions that force trade-offs; once she arrives, everything proceeds as foretold. The dawn deadline is mentioned but never truly bites—she succeeds without visible sacrifice or risk. As a result, conflict feels more ceremonial than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can she remain safely isolated without suffocating, or must she risk reentering a world that once drowned her—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates via the encroachment and the appearance of her former self, which concretizes the internal conflict and forces a stance. The final act of opening the door and stepping out is an earned resolution rather than a soft reset. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and discursive, with relatively little moment-to-moment resistance or complication beyond that single deepening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Maya reopens herself to belief and risk or remains imprisoned by past exploitation—is legible and coherent throughout. There is a meaningful tightening when the text specifically demands “BRING THE BOLT,” making the encounter personal and forcing a choice rooted in family history and trauma. Pressure then deepens as the quantum promise manifests and she must confront a promise that does not betray her. Still, conflict never quite feels dangerous or sharply priced on the page; external stakes and tangible costs remain low, skewing the tension toward contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara confronting the weight and secrets of her family legacy—is implied but never put under explicit, escalating test. There is a mild tightening from general exploration to entering the sacred room to engaging the gramophone, yet the pressure remains more atmospheric than choice-driven. The supernatural activation of her grandmother’s voice is a promising turn, but it arrives before any real cost or dilemma is clarified. Without a culminating decision or visible price, the conflict feels like a poised setup rather than a fully escalated arc.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aldric remains a hollow recluse or finds a new relationship to possibility—is clear, and pressure does gently tighten as the enchantment wakes and the marionettes enact “roads not taken.” His agency in reading, speaking the vow, animating each puppet, and finally releasing the last one earns the internal resolution. Still, the conflict is almost entirely internal and highly contemplative; there’s little sense that anything might go wrong or that he’s sacrificing a truly difficult alternative. The result is thematically satisfying but not especially tense on a beat-to-beat level.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Mara bears witness to and honors erased children—is clear but stays mostly internal and reflective. The discovery of the button is a modest escalation that deepens stakes by embodying a human kindness almost lost to bureaucracy. Still, tension remains low and there’s little practical dilemma or trade-off; her choice to treat the button reverently never feels at risk or costly in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—truth versus an erasing regime, and Mira’s survival—are weighty and clearly signaled, and the audit provides an effective inciting crisis. Yet the conflict remains mostly conceptual: there’s little immediate, scene-level resistance to her escape or descent beyond the ticking clock. No real reversal or painful trade-off is dramatized; options don’t noticeably narrow after the initial flight. The piece reads more as a poised transition into a larger conflict than as a fully escalated mini-arc.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from fully speaking—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Escalation is present: the hush feels “heavier today,” whispers intensify, and a fragment of code breaks through, forcing an adapted musical response with those three sharp, corrective notes. Conflict is mostly conceptual and textural rather than visceral, so the risk feels slightly distant despite world-scale stakes. Still, the middle breach and his precise, learned counter form a clear tightening and credible test of his commitment within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and acting on a prophecy that will secure her people’s survival—is clear but plays out with very low resistance. The main tightening is the revelation of drought and a forgotten seed, which reorients Seraphina from routine decoding to a consequential retrieval, yet the retrieval itself offers no genuine threat, dilemma, or sacrifice. Internal and external conflicts barely rub against each other: she is prepared, competent, and essentially unchallenged in executing what the prophecy demands. The ending reads more like a deepening of meaning than a true escalation of pressure or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will follow this tenuous lead into danger in order to pursue her brother/compass—is clear, but escalation is gentle rather than gripping. The letter functions as the inciting pressure, and there is one meaningful tightening as she shifts from surface decay to subterranean descent, leaving safety and light. However, there’s no on-page reversal, direct threat, or explicit cost beyond implied risk and obsession; her choice to descend is not tested or complicated. The conflict remains largely anticipatory, so tension is present but not sharply honed.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will remain the cautious, reputation-guarding alchemist or risk re-engaging with her brother’s dangerous mysteries—is clear and paid off when she chooses the risky, mystical kintsugi repair. Internal conflict escalates as she recognizes her past dismissal of him and feels the coin’s pulse, pushing her toward engaging with what she once rejected. However, there is little in the way of concrete on-page resistance or reversal—no procedural failure or ethical snag complicates the repair itself—so pressure rises more in theme than in felt peril. The emotional cost is present but could be sharpened by at least one hard trade-off or genuine risk taken in the act.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—can Mira help this soldier move from paralyzing shame to laughter and release—is clear, and the piece offers one main tightening as she begins to play and tell his specific story. However, the conflict feels largely one-sided; the soldier offers no active resistance beyond his established shame, and there’s little sense she might fail or pay a new price here. Her method appears reliable from the outset, and it works on the first attempt without complication or reversal. The emotional cost is present but static, limiting escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s stance toward her own complicity and whether she will submit again (follow the beacon) or face an unknown cost on her own terms, signaled through the strap and the facility’s unlocked doors. Pressure escalates through recognition—the strap as beacon, the realization that freedom may itself be an experiment, and the impending “price” of stepping into the clearing. The final moment crystallizes an internal conflict rather than resolving it, which fits the mode but leaves stakes largely conceptual. A slightly clearer narrowing of concrete options would heighten the sense of irrevocable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s stance toward her role—passive carrier of history versus active Keeper—which is signaled early and resolved at the end. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through sharp reversals: the identification of the Keeper, the painting’s revelation, and the alchemist’s explanation successively narrow interpretive options. However, there’s little genuine friction or trade-off; once information arrives, acceptance feels nearly inevitable and carries more implied than dramatized cost. As a result, escalation feels gentle and contemplative rather than gripping, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Marcus will follow this echo’s invitation and uncover what’s hidden, which is intriguing but understated. There is escalation—from generic inspection to sensing a presence to identifying the hatch—but pressure never quite sharpens into real risk, moral tension, or sacrifice. Marcus’s agency is evident (choosing to follow the echo, climbing toward the hatch), yet those choices don’t foreclose other meaningful options. As a result, the ending feels more like the start of stakes than their culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to release this ancient, compressed whisper into a negotiated reality—is conceptually rich but lightly pressured in scene. Elara never seriously considers not opening the bottle or any alternative method; there is no meaningful test of her commitment, only the inevitability of following the frost’s “directions.” The rupture and Library shudder imply cost, yet they land more as wondrous transformation than as a trade-off she must weigh. As a result, escalation reads as a graceful swell rather than a tightening that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary external pressure is the incoming time-storm and her race to cover mirrors; the internal pressure is her evolving stance on history and revolution. Escalation is clear when the storm hits before the final mirror is covered and she glimpses the founders as refugees, which tightens the thematic stakes. However, she never faces a hard trade-off or sacrifice; her method works as intended, and the cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt as loss or foreclosed option. The conflict is effective but a bit low-voltage for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Cassian rekindle song/light against encroaching silence—is clear and tied to his duty and identity. Escalation exists in the sense of “last fragment of captured moonlight” and the orchestrion’s long silence, culminating in the tense moment before the machine either sings or fails. However, the pressure remains more atmospheric than acute: the narrative doesn’t strongly distinguish what failure tonight would mean versus his ongoing endurance, so the trade-off feels conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. The partial success (a thin but true note, light not fully reclaimed) provides a credible, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s pursuit of the ultimate origin/threshold of petrichor and meaning—is clear and develops through the compass and descent. Pressure escalates in a largely textural way: from industrial silence to uncanny tool to vast subterranean stillness, culminating in the knowledge that she will not return. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s little concrete resistance or alternative path pressing on her, so the decision point, while resonant, feels gently foregone rather than hard-won. A slightly sharper articulation of what she’s giving up, or a moment of genuine hesitation, would heighten the sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The primary pressure is situational and internal: the storm and the dead GPS push Aria into the archway and into confrontation with the lantern slide’s meaning. There is a clear deepening when she realizes the images are woven across centuries and reinterprets her work, but escalation is gentle and contemplative rather than sharply tightening options. The storm never quite feels dangerous enough to force a hard trade-off; it’s more a catalyst for reflection than a genuine threat with lasting consequence. As a result, the final choice to begin a large piece lands more as an inspired continuation than a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is largely intellectual/spiritual—answering why flowers bloom at night—and the story honors that quieter mode of pressure. There is a meaningful deepening when Mira discovers the encoded celestial map and reinterprets her grandmother’s legacy, which narrows her options toward a new, more thematically loaded mural. However, escalation is very gentle: there’s little sense of alternative outcomes or what she risks by failing to find an answer, so tension remains low-grade curiosity rather than genuine strain. The final choice to “begin to paint” is more affirmation than trade-off, with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam will answer the lagoon’s call and confront the family/paranormal history—is established early and followed through. Escalation is present in her progression from archival decoding to literal descent and kneeling at the water’s edge, culminating in the apparition. However, pressure remains mostly atmospheric and internal; there’s little sense of what she risks by going forward versus turning away, and no real alternative path is dramatized. As a result, the climax feels more like an inevitable unveiling than a test of commitment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether a civilization can be rebuilt through memory rather than wishes—is clear but faces little resistance. Once Elias kneels and begins the process, success unfolds smoothly: there is no significant uncertainty, setback, or alternative path meaningfully tested. Internal conflict about his choice has mostly happened off-page; in this moment, he is executing rather than deciding under pressure. As a result, escalation feels more like unfolding spectacle than tightening conflict, keeping this below the strongest band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what will replace the foghorn’s silence and what Seraphine will do with the arriving oaths—is clear and thematically rich, and there is one meaningful deepening when she realizes the silence is intentional and actively filled by the dead. Pressure is primarily internal and conceptual, with her agency expressed through choosing to listen and to accept custodianship of the promises. However, escalation remains gentle; there’s little sense of foreclosed alternatives, risk, or sacrifice beyond the implied weight of responsibility, so tension never fully tightens to elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully reopening the vortex inheritance to guide the hybrid seedling and carry forward ancestral time—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates mainly through intensification of focus and metaphysical stakes (gathering herself, inviting time to double back) rather than through concrete obstacles or reversals. The ritual appears challenging but not meaningfully jeopardized; there’s little sense that she might fail or that an alternative path is live on the page. As a result, the climax feels like a deepening rather than a tested, costly turn, keeping conflict strong but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—ensure the siren network works before the storm hits—is established early and remains coherent, but the outcome never feels seriously in doubt. The only real tightening is the approach of the invisible front and the narrowing time window implied by “perhaps another hour, perhaps less,” yet no obstacle or failure mode presses on her actions. Her agency (throwing the switch on schedule) resolves the situation cleanly without visible trade-offs or risk, keeping tension relatively low-key. This reads more as a poised, contemplative test than an escalated conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether the janitor will treat the fallen star as mere detritus or as a being whose journey deserves empathy, and that choice is consistently, if quietly, affirmed. The only real tightening is the discovery of the star fragment, which prompts a more focused act of witnessing. Yet there is little resistance, risk, or live alternative; the janitor never seems tempted to behave otherwise, so internal or external pressure barely escalates. The conflict remains largely conceptual and gentle, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—who will hold and complete the covenant of unspoken words—is present, but pressure remains very gentle. Escalation comes primarily from the ghost’s purposeful appearance and the revelation/digging up of the box, a single tightening rather than layered tests of resolve. Mira’s acceptance feels right but almost frictionless; she never appears close to refusing or failing. The result is thematically satisfying but low-tension, which limits the conflict score at a high-literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical: the stake is whether she can reframe time from measurement to felt texture. Pressure builds modestly—from professional curiosity to a more personal, existential recognition—but there’s little sense of options foreclosed or real risk in failure. The garage-sale method and the fragment offer opportunities for more concrete tension that remain largely unexplored. As a result, escalation is present but gentle, and the final stance feels more contemplatively earned than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to broken/incomplete things—is clear but gently pressured; tension is more philosophical than situational. There is a meaningful deepening when the injured bird appears, tying the feather to a living cost and giving the tending real emotional stakes. However, the poet’s path is never seriously challenged; no option is foreclosed and no choice bites back. As a result, escalation is more tonal than consequential, limiting the felt cost of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict and stakes are primarily existential and internal, with almost no on-page escalation: Maren has already accepted both her role and her prognosis before the scene begins. Her micro-choices (continuing the remodel, climbing the ladder despite weakness) demonstrate endurance, but they don’t significantly narrow options or force a new trade-off. The dominant stake—how to respond to impending death in a place defined by slow continuity—remains essentially stable throughout. This makes for a persuasive mood piece but limits felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can reconfigure her understanding of homecoming and of herself after first contact—is clear, and the story does tighten as her “artificial pilgrimage” becomes genuinely transformative. Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, so escalation is more about density of reflection than about concrete turns. Her decision to leave academia is off-stage, and in-scene choices are mostly interpretive rather than tactical, which keeps the pressure relatively low-key. The final stance shift is earned, but one sharper on-page moment of dilemma or renunciation would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether life can return to the dead reef—is conceptually high but not felt as risky or contested on the page. There are no obstacles or reversals; once the coachman begins planting, success arrives almost immediately with the first green thread. Pressure doesn’t really escalate; the birds’ silence suggests attention more than danger, and the spell is never in doubt. As a result, the piece reads more as a contemplative ritual vignette than as a scene under real tension.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can access the brother’s message and thus bridge emotional distance—is clear but remains largely internal and low-pressure on the page. The one significant tightening is the discovery that the cylinder must be “read” tactually, which shifts tactics but doesn’t arise out of strongly escalating obstacles in scene. There is little on-the-page resistance or risk beyond prior summarized failures, so tension never quite crests. The resolution is more a gentle reveal than a hard-won choice with visible cost, which keeps conflict from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Mira’s confusion and guilt versus her need to find an ethical orientation after the shutdown—is legible and resolved through an internal stance shift. The glimpse functions as the main tightening beat, forcing her to reconsider her past, her family, and what “true north” means. However, the pressure never feels particularly acute: there is little sense that anything she does here could materially worsen or improve the external situation, and no real trade-off beyond accepting a more bearable frame. As a result, stakes are emotionally meaningful but somewhat abstract and low-tension on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Caelius can meaningfully amend a formative wrong—is clear, and the act of kneeling and offering the pouch is a credible crystallizing move. However, conflict is mostly internal and largely resolved before the meeting; Seraph offers minimal resistance, and there’s no tangible risk that she’ll reject or reinterpret his gesture. The “impossible” line and revelation that the pieces were stolen decades ago hint at higher stakes but don’t escalate into a new dilemma. As a result, pressure increases only modestly, more in concept than in on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will relate to loss and history in the wake of the interregnum—is clear, and the pressure tightens from spelling her sister’s name one last time to walking the pattern for “beginning.” The gallery’s silence, the absent pawns, and the decision to treat absence as meaningful provide a credible internal resolution. However, on-page conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with little sense of options narrowing under live pressure; the piece never quite hits a sharp ethical or practical pinch point. Tension operates more as sustained ache than as escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to bury her gift or reclaim it despite the pain—is clear and tightened effectively by the keeper’s condition that she “plant something of [herself]” in the stone. The main escalation is interior: seven nights of resistance resolve into the risk of an honest question, which then forces her to experience both pain and gratitude in memory. The cost is emotionally legible but remains largely contemplative; there is little external or situational pressure pushing back beyond her own fear and the implied safety of the mountain. As a result, the conflict feels rich but somewhat low-tension by elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reinterpret her “failure” and forgive herself—is clear, and the pressure tightens as the thunder returns and the village begins to move. The conflict is predominantly internal, with the tapestry serving as the crucible where her old narrative and emerging understanding clash. Escalation is subtle but present: initial avoidance, then engagement, then working against the implicit clock of the ending lull. The quietness of external stakes and the relative ease of the final turn keep this just below the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Sera will allow the temple to erase more of her truth or successfully seed resistance—is clear and tightened by the ticking approach of the ritual and the arrival of children. Her agency drives escalation: from solitary writing, to sharing poems, to orchestrating a chorus that defangs the ceremony. However, the external opposition (priests, institutional punishment) never fully materializes into a concrete consequence; their “rigid faces” arrive, but no explicit threat or near-loss tests her resolve in the moment. As a result, the piece resolves with conceptual victory more than felt jeopardy or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—survival of both her body and her forty-year project versus the need to extract meaning at the brink—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates via the “three breaths,” hull shudders, and rising acid, while the internal conflict deepens as she doubles down on the ritual instead of escape. The ultimate resolution, however, leans heavily on her internal stance shift, with the external threat softening as the sea “retreats,” which slightly blurs the cost and undercuts the earlier dire framing. The escalation is strong but not ruthless; the scene could benefit from one more concrete price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus remains frozen in grief or reengages with creation as letting go—is established early via his three-year withdrawal from painting. Pressure escalates when the familiar shell appears in an impossible place and the pool reveals the younger self; this rupture forces a re-evaluation of his promise and identity. The choice to relinquish the shell into the pool is a credible, costed resolution that forecloses his prior stance. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, remaining low-temperature; stakes stay conceptually clear but never feel viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can guide endangered ships when standard methods falter—is established clearly and tightened when we learn thermal currents have made the beacon unreliable. Pressure escalates as she chooses an untested, more mystical method, with her hands on the lens and ships “fighting treacherous currents.” That said, her attempt meets no palpable resistance; the act of sending intention succeeds almost immediately, with little sense of risk, potential backlash, or partial failure. The conflict is thus more contemplative than harrowing, effective but not maximally sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the caller moves toward or away from the site of her grief—is clearly signaled and sharpened by the north/south migration metaphor. The meaningful tightening is Mara’s decision to go to the woman and accompany her north, implicitly accepting the cost of walking into grief rather than soothing her into retreat. Conflict, however, remains mostly conceptual; the journey itself contains no new obstacle, counter-force, or moral bind beyond the initial choice, so tension doesn’t escalate much past that moment of commitment. The cost of Mara’s stance is gestured at rather than tangibly tested in scene, keeping the stakes resonant but relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—preserving outlawed emotional capacity and seeking a path back to psychological safety—are compelling in concept but remain mostly abstract in this specific scene. External conflict is minimal: the storm’s aftermath is navigated with “practiced efficiency,” and no antagonist or concrete threat arrives to test her. Internal conflict is gestured at (“Why cultivate psychological safety…?”) but resolves quickly, with little on-page struggle or real alternative considered. As a result, escalation feels more like steady continuation than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aldric can decode the stranger’s gesture and what it means for his own past—is clear from early on. Pressure deepens when the vanished footprints and concealed note transform vague curiosity into a direct confrontation with his abandonment. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s little on-page struggle over whether to accept or reject the offered reconnection, so escalation feels more like a graceful reveal than a test with sharply felt alternatives. The ending decision to write is emotionally apt but arrives with minimal apparent cost beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will risk stepping through an uncanny, possibly lethal doorway to pursue her father’s promised “way home”—is clear and sharpened by the ticking clock of the rising creek. Escalation is present but relatively gentle: ants lead deeper, the cavern grows stranger, water creeps higher, and the pull of the chip intensifies. The external flood threat and the internal desire to find home interlock well, yet her final decision comes with little overt resistance or moral friction, so the trade-off feels more contemplative than pressured. The conflict is coherent and satisfying but less than maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether she can recover meaning and understand the warning/dreams—is clear, but pressure remains gentle throughout. The climb offers a nominal physical challenge, yet no real risk or opposition emerges; once she reaches the grotto, the revelation flows toward comfort rather than trial. There is a single deepening turn when she realizes the warning is a summons, but nothing on the page forces a hard trade-off or forecloses a path. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—how to “capture” presence without killing it—is clear but remains almost entirely internal and philosophical, with no external counterforce. There is a mild escalation as Maren reconceives the shell’s purpose and recognizes the hidden cost of her earlier extraction model. However, pressure never quite tightens into a real trade-off or loss; her new stance seems available without serious risk or sacrifice. The whispered secret is framed as pivotal, but its content and stakes are elided, softening any sense of concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully shape his chaos into narrative in the face of collapsing time and identity—is clear and internally pressurized. Escalation is mostly internal: from recounting the grave and curse of lucidity to the jealousy of the younger self to the near-completion of the scroll and his explicit choice to stop fighting the current. The cost is emotional and existential rather than situational, but it is felt: he renounces control/organization, foreclosing the fantasy of ever fully mastering his chronicle. The conflict is intentionally low-external, which slightly limits perceived escalation for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is almost entirely internal: how to live and make meaning without her primary sense. Stakes (identity and vocation) are significant but the on-page pressure is gentle, with no strong external antagonist or forced choice beyond her evolving attention and acceptance. There is a clear deepening—from numb loss to recognition that her skill was always about “reading between the lines”—but the escalation is a steady glow rather than a tightening vice. That quietness keeps this strong but not top-tier on the stakes/escalation axis.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Elara versus her own mistrust of superstition and shame about her affliction—is clear and escalates modestly as storm and crystallizing intensify. The shift from trying to force textbook symbols to following her remembered, embodied knowledge is a meaningful tightening of options. Stakes remain largely internal (creative/authentic self-expression) with minimal external pressure or real risk of loss in the present scene. As a result, tension is steady but never fully sharp, and the price she pays at the climax is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will confront her fear and speak honestly before the fleeting connection ends—is clear from early on and sharpened by the ticking-clock of both the currents and the orchard’s destruction. Pressure escalates from anticipation at the edge of the orchard to the cramped immediacy of the archive, tightening further when Margot calls out Eleanor’s evasiveness and as the currents audibly/visibly fade. Her choice to offer a plain, “ugly” apology rather than a metaphorical dodge is a credible, costly turn. If anything, the external orchard-stakes stay more symbolic than tactically constraining, but they still contribute meaningful time-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.7)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract: Elara is the "end of history witness," but we never see what she might lose or risk by acting or failing to act in this scene. There is no concrete obstacle or opposition; the Archive responds to her, but never resists or complicates her goal. Her ritual begins, yet nothing on the page tightens, reverses, or forces a trade-off. As a result, tension is minimal despite the grand conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is Aira’s ongoing quest to apprehend what clocks “really” measure, and there is a mild tightening as the water reaches its critical level and the horizon light appears. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; nothing meaningfully challenges her belief or jeopardizes her work, and no option is truly foreclosed. The alignment night is framed as special, yet its pressure remains conceptual rather than felt as risk. As a result, tension is gentle and contemplative rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—how Mira understands intimacy and letting go as she leaves this constructed ecosystem of distance. Pressure escalates modestly: the coworkers’ approach, the man breaking his pattern to speak, and the formation of the triangle intensify the situation without adding new external constraints. The final revaluation of their relationship architecture functions as an earned deepening rather than a sharp turn. Still, the conflict remains very low-key, with little sense that another path is meaningfully foreclosed beyond the emotional cost of departure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her inheritance of risk from self-destruction into a different kind of living relationship with her father—is clear, but conflict is primarily internal and quiet. Pressure builds modestly through the graffiti mystery and the mental rehearsals of the traverse rather than via overt confrontation. Her final articulation of the graffiti as “invitations” is a meaningful stance shift, yet the on-page cost (what it concretely forecloses in their future or his gambling) is more implied than dramatized. As a result, escalation feels satisfying but not fully maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and thematic: the cost of chosen anonymity, the emotional toll of absorbing others’ endings, the tension between presence and erasure. These are articulated but not dramatized through a turn or test; Mira neither faces a new kind of call nor doubts her practice in-scene. The phone ringing at the end gestures toward renewed pressure but doesn’t escalate or reconfigure her options. As a result, the piece reads as a richly textured tableau rather than a pressured narrative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—how she will relate to memory and the covenant going forward—is clear and resolved through a shift in stance. Pressure is gentle but present: her longstanding fear of scrutiny is confronted as she finally studies the photo in the fading light and chooses to reinterpret preservation. Escalation is more deepening than tightening, and there is no sharp reversal or external obstacle testing her resolve. This keeps the conflict satisfying for lyric short work but somewhat soft for a top-tier competitive slot.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the logistician will remain safely detached or risk vulnerability to address their loneliness—is clear and coheres with the reciprocity rule. Pressure quietly escalates from banter to the admission of what they need and the woman’s imposed condition to stay and talk. The conflict resolves a bit smoothly, with minimal resistance once the rule is explained; more dramatized struggle at the moment of assent would heighten the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint and learning to navigate emotional terrain—is clear, and the shift from outward search to inward realization provides a conceptual turn. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative without much friction; the forest never truly resists her, and there’s no real threat of failure. The melody’s revelation is granted rather than earned through a difficult choice or sacrifice. As a result, escalation feels like an intensification of image and insight rather than rising pressure with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to extract meaning and, implicitly, to validate herself after a career-defining mistake—is clear but mostly interior. Pressure escalates once, when she chooses to persist with her unconventional method over two hours until the signal resolves as a “response.” That recognition narrows her emotional options, pushing her toward acceptance of her exile as meaningful, but there is little concrete jeopardy or visible trade-off in the moment beyond time and psychic effort. The conflict is cohesive and non-static, yet the cost could be surfaced more sharply to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can find a living form for her grief and inherited language—is clear and grows from introspective practice to a shared, risky improvisation in front of Elena. The primary escalation is the move from practicing old tales alone to creating a new “song” for someone who shares her loss, which is a meaningful deepening. The cost—exposure of unmediated grief, acceptance that some memories won’t be recorded—is legible but remains interior and safe from external consequence. The pressure is coherent but could tighten further with one more concrete complication or potential rupture in the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will find and properly steward this buried, dangerous knowledge—is clear but mostly conceptual, with little immediate risk or opposition in the Archive itself. The main tightening is the move from fragment → self-portrait → hidden tapestry, which deepens stakes by tying her to a lineage. However, there’s minimal on-page resistance or cost at the moment of discovery; her success feels almost frictionless. The emotional and ethical stakes are strong in idea but under-tested in dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain a compliant “guinea pig” or reclaim agency by using the treatment space to resurrect a shared consciousness dream—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure does escalate modestly from being observed and objectified to exploiting the precise hush moment to attempt a risky, secret synchronization. However, opposition is mostly ambient (offstage scientists, implied dangers of the protocol) and there’s no strong on-page reversal or concrete test that forces a painful trade-off in the moment. The final choice to keep drumming and “let them wonder” is a satisfying stance crystallization, but the lack of overt friction or cost on the scene level keeps tension in the solid rather than exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stakes—hundreds of workers’ lives and an ideological contest between analog whispers and official channels—are strong in concept and are signaled clearly via Reyes’s challenge. However, the actual conflict remains oddly frictionless: we are told she evacuates two hundred people but aren’t shown obstacles, near-misses, or specific hard choices under fire. Because of that, escalation feels more like a stated accumulation than pressure tightening, and the cost of her stance is largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The Reyes confrontation at the end provides a satisfying but low-temperature conflict beat rather than a peak.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the boy’s suicidal drift can be interrupted and re-weighted—is clear and present from early on in the “mathematics of pain” and “quiet calculation” language. Escalation is quiet but real: his arrival, her choice to deploy the mirror, his gradual engagement with the patterns, and the mutual gaze at the end form a tightening. The cost and foreclosure are subtle: she rejects direct intervention in favor of this patient, riskier method; he does not choose death tonight, but that choice is held in suspension rather than definitively turned. It’s strong situational pressure, but a shade too thematically smooth to hit the very top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict and stakes are primarily conceptual: the tension between certainty and doubt, between a quiet status quo and a slow insurgency of hesitation. The “rebellion” never faces real resistance on the page; there’s no moment where Eleanor risks exposure, pushback, or sacrifice, so pressure escalates only modestly through the accumulation of examples. The tightening is thematic rather than dramatic: we move from teaching children to town-wide displays to individual life changes, but without a decisive risk or trade-off. As a result, the stakes feel meaningful but low-intensity, more reflective than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—remain safe but emotionally locked, or risk self-annihilation in pursuit of inner freedom—is clear and sharpened by the whale’s increasingly insistent call. Escalation is primarily internal but legible: the first distant call interrupts her work, then grows closer as she confronts her attachment to the talisman and finally separates from it. The cost is present (abandoning her old self, potentially her whole life on land), though it remains more symbolic than concretely dramatized in terms of physical danger or social fallout. That keeps tension just shy of maximal sharpness for a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving an authentic inner space of grief/neutrality under an enforced-happiness regime—is clear and coherent throughout. Pressure deepens via revelations (mother’s death under the mandate, theaters turned to joy centers, the hack of the speakers), and the final choice to sustain defiant blankness under the turbines is a credible endurance resolution. However, escalation is mostly internal and historical; the present-moment scene lacks a fresh on-page tightening (the drone has already passed, and nothing new materially threatens her during the scene). The conflict is rich but relatively static in the present line, which keeps the tension band solid rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core stake—whether she can and will cross a space once held as inviolably sacred—is stated, but on the page opposition is more historical than active. Once the ban is lifted, the legendary resistance (“as though the air itself had become a wall”) never materially pushes back; the hum intensifies but functions as welcome rather than test. The main “escalation” is a perceptual clarification that the boundary is mental, not a raised cost or narrowing of options. As a result, pressure feels gentle and meditative rather than tense, limiting dramatic power.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transmit her way of seeing/awakening to the apprentice—is coherent but very gently pressured. The main tightening is his realization that she’s “speaking” to him and her responding with a more elaborate arrangement and the gift, which deepens intimacy but never truly risks rejection or loss beyond the lightly treated reed sacrifice. Conflict is almost entirely internal and aspirational, with no resistance from the apprentice or environment. The result is quietly affecting but low in tension for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether an artificial pilgrimage can carry genuine meaning—is clear, but it rarely faces concrete opposition or narrowing options on the page. The committee, infrastructural fragility, and social need are largely summarized, not dramatized, so escalation reads more as accumulating reflection than as rising pressure. The “night before the first trial” frame adds some forward lean, yet there’s no real turning point that forces a trade-off or visible sacrifice. Tension remains mostly philosophical and steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is emotional—whether and how a shattered mourner can be guided toward a future self without betraying her loss—and it is stated clearly. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and largely resolved in principle before the scene begins: Elara is already committed to helping, and the observatory is fundamentally benevolent. The new arrival offers no resistance, and there’s no meaningful reversal or escalation beyond the gentle deepening when the pendant evokes “the smallest flicker of wonder.” As a result, the ending feels more like a graceful continuation than a true tightening or test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Soren can relinquish his futile reverse-engineering of the crash and face his role in it—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates in a quiet but legible way: from his compulsion to “find the exact point where everything had gone wrong,” through the branching spread that reframes blame, to his eventual confession and somatic release as he rolls the tape. The conflict is primarily internal, with Maren as a facilitating presence rather than an active counterforce, which keeps the tension low-key. The cost of his shift (owning guilt, surrendering totalizing control) is conceptually clear but under-dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding and properly purifying nostalgia—appears early and coheres throughout, with the key deepening being her shift from control to surrender. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the ritual intensifies, the atoms rise, and her boundaries dissolve. There is limited sense of risk beyond implied emotional/spiritual cost; nothing pushes back hard against her except the conceptual difficulty of the task. The result is thematically potent but slightly low on felt jeopardy for a top-tier conflict score.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the evolving “shape of hope” amid the Unbinding—is conceptually clear but remains largely abstract on the page. There is one implied intensification when Mira returns to the mother/child footage and studies it “like her own reflection,” but this doesn’t force a new stance or visible sacrifice. Tension operates more as a sustained mood than as escalating pressure; no concrete option is foreclosed, and Mira’s tactics do not notably change. The result is thematically rich but dramatically gentle conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Mara will live and act after discovering Aldric’s fraud—is clear early and tied to whether she can preserve self-respect without abandoning compassion. The main tightening occurs as she reframes the tail reconstruction from honoring Aldric’s lesson to honoring the animal and, by extension, her own values. However, the pressure curve is relatively gentle and even; there’s no distinct on-page moment where a concrete alternative path is vividly foreclosed. The cost is emotionally present but remains mostly internal and reflective rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can face and reframe her guilt about her brother—is signaled early via the ivy’s question and the scars on her palms. Pressure escalates as she moves from tower top down into the unknown basement and tunnel, culminating in the tactile confrontation with her brother’s handprints and echoing voice. This is primarily an internal conflict, but the physical descent gives it a credible sense of risk and narrowing options. The cost (reopening grief and relinquishing the self-protective narrative of blame) is legible, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this stored “unused love” will be recognized or disturbed—is clear and tracked, and there is some escalation as Mira pushes deeper into the film strip’s memory. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with minimal friction or real risk; no alternative path feels live, and the choice to leave the reel hidden carries conceptual weight but little felt jeopardy. The piece reads more as an extended realization than as an actively tightening conflict, which reduces the sense of cost at the climactic decision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—her need to “free” her creativity versus the damage of relentless self-pressure—is clear and sustained. Escalation comes from the accumulated toll of sleeplessness and failure into the breaking point where she physically yields to rest, which is a credible narrowing of options. The cost and trade-off (abandoning her old tactics, accepting that control is counterproductive) are legible, but the absence of any concrete external stake (a deadline, a relationship, a particular work) keeps the pressure at a more abstract, contemplative level. As a result, tension is strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the clock and archive from those who would take them—is established and briefly tested by the merchant’s interest. However, his pressure never convincingly escalates beyond a philosophical overture; there is no real sense that Mira might lose anything or be forced into a costly trade-off. Her micro-choice to say no and keep walking is consistent but low-friction. Conflict here feels more suggested than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Cyrus will confront and pass beyond the manifested frontier of his own mind—is clear, and the tangle of mechanical vines provides a concrete locus of pressure. There is a single meaningful tightening when he meets the impassable wall and must decide to deploy the gear, which in turn reveals the doorway. However, the opposition yields immediately and gently once he asks “the right question,” so escalation feels relatively low-risk and untested. The choice to step through is more thematic than tense, with the cost of renouncing his old reality only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will finally cross into a more courageous, alive self—is signaled early and sharpened by the guides’ silent question. Escalation is primarily internal but tracks: from static vigil to committing to the journey, to confronting the nature of courage, to choosing a path and dropping the leash. The price is believable but quiet: relinquishing long-guarded safety for uncertain aliveness. What keeps this from a higher band is the relative softness of external pressure; nothing in the world resists her beyond her own inertia.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will cling to “safety” or move toward risk/responsibility—is clear, and the discovery of the bolt and dust offers a credible tightening point that forces him to re-evaluate his choice to stay silent. His micro-choice not to report the safety issue, to pocket the bolt, and continue upward while entertaining following the trail is an earned internal turn. However, the conflict remains almost entirely interior and contemplative; no counter-pressure (from other staff, actual danger, or a concrete risk to others) presses his choice into a sharper dilemma. As a result, the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally tested, keeping escalation in the solid but not exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing a false king—is clear, but the on-page conflict is almost entirely deferred; we’re told of a trap being laid rather than feeling it tested or tightened. There is minimal escalation or narrowing of options within the scene; Threnody’s stance at the end is essentially her stance at the start, just restated against a cosmic clock. The hint of the scholar’s birth introduces future motion, but it doesn’t arise from a new choice or sacrifice on her part. As a result, tension feels more like elegant setup than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is intellectual-emotional: understanding whether migration corridors and reefs are truly gone or shifting, signaled clearly through her monitoring role and backstory. Escalation is modest but present: the routine pattern of readings is broken by anomalous signals, prompting her to halt and then retune her tapping as she reorients the buoys. However, there is little sense of immediate risk or trade-off—no clear foreclosed option, deadline, or moral tension—so pressure never fully tightens. The final choice to adopt a new rhythm feels meaningful but relatively low-cost in the on-page present.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—the future direction and meaning of the rebellion during the lull—is clear, and the pressure coheres around whether to accept drift or reclaim purpose. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the hum grows stronger, twilight deepens, and her reflections sharpen until she commits to reigniting the movement nonviolently. This works, but there’s minimal real narrowing of options or on-page cost; no antagonist, counterargument, or tangible risk interrupts her trajectory. As a result, tension hums rather than tightens, and the climax is contemplative rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—obeying elders and reburying the embryo vs. honoring an insurgent, evolutionary tradition—is clear and thematically strong. Pressure increases as the plants go from calm to screaming and as the script is recognized as a map, culminating in Yara’s choice to unseal the chamber. Yet almost all opposition is off-stage (elders as reported), so Yara’s shift reads more as a thoughtful realization than as a hard-fought, high-cost decision under pressure. The stakes feel large conceptually but remain somewhat abstract in immediate, scene-level terms.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how she will live with irreversible loss—is clear and under quiet, consistent pressure. Escalation comes not from external reversals but from intensifying somatic and emotional confrontation, culminating in the “grief like weather” and freeze descriptions that prepare the final stance. The closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: she chooses endurance and embodied presence over fantasy of erasure, with the visible cost of ongoing vulnerability. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, but never static.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary conflict—Mira’s struggle with her fractured perception and artistic “failure”—is coherent and thematically rich but remains largely internal and contemplative. There is some escalation as the walls seem to close in and as she literally descends, but the pressure never quite forces a hard trade-off or visible loss beyond her earlier humiliation. Her agency drives the turns (choosing to stay, to untangle, to descend), yet these decisions come without much friction or resistance. The ending resolves tension via realization more than via tested commitment, keeping stakes emotionally resonant but relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis versus risking the same fate as Vasquez—is clearly sketched but never truly sharpened into a live dilemma. Pressure increases somewhat as the ink begins to glow and time thins, but the escalation is more descriptive than confrontational. The tracker’s decision to proceed reads as foregone rather than tested against fear, duty to the Bureau, or any alternative path. As a result, tension is steady but low, and the climax feels more like a consummation of premise than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether to unleash a truth that could destabilize a centuries-long war—is compelling, and the internal conflict between archival duty and moral responsibility is legible. Pressure does intensify from initial shock to the choice to transmit, but the escalation is smooth rather than sharply tightening—no concrete external risk, time limit, or antagonist forces her hand. As a result, the danger of scandal and upheaval is more declared than viscerally felt. Her final act shows agency, yet the price of that agency isn’t dramatized within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira will live in relation to a violent, collapsing world—is clear, but it is largely resolved before the story begins. The only external pressure, the arrival of refugees, resolves smoothly and without real cost or dilemma, undercutting any sense of test or reversal. There is some internal conflict between her inheritance and her chosen path, but it is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in a live present-tense choice. As a result, tension feels low and escalation shallow for a piece aiming at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Morwen can capture the echo without scattering it—is clear, and the pressure meaningfully tightens as he learns that noise drives the echo away and he must “voice silence itself.” His zigzag movement between spires and the garden’s growing complexity serve as a concrete articulation of escalation. However, the threat of failure and its consequences remain abstract, and his success feels relatively unopposed once he understands the method. A sharper sense of risk or sacrifice at the climax would lift the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether Eleanor will repeat her family’s pattern of suppression or break it—is clearly established once the accusation is made. Pressure coherently deepens as she runs the “proof by contradiction” and discovers sabotage, culminating in the decision to act against her own organization. However, conflict remains largely internal and conceptual; no concrete opposing force directly pushes back on the page beyond the offstage journalist and unnamed saboteur. As a result, escalation feels intellectually sharp but a bit low on visceral friction and visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform/relieve the “dissonance” of her old guilt—is clear and signaled early. Pressure does deepen once the firmware is dated to the night of her sister’s death and then again when the coordinates lead her into the chamber where the fatal moment loops. However, each turn arrives with relatively little friction; obstacles are conceptual rather than dramatized, and she encounters no strong resistance, moral calculus, or risk beyond the weight of memory itself. Escalation is present but could be sharpened by a more concrete sense of what she might lose or break by intervening.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict—whether Elara can find an honest way to make art without feeling she is lying—is coherent and present from the first paragraph. Pressure escalates when she abandons routine drawing to incorporate the tile, resulting in the emergent hush and her realization. However, tension remains largely contemplative; there’s little sense that a real alternative future (creative paralysis, self-betrayal) is on the verge of locking in. The resolution feels genuine but relatively low-friction, which softens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether anything meaningful can be salvaged from total destruction—remains largely internal and philosophical, with little concrete opposition. Pressure does deepen once Soren appears and Lysara recognizes their shared affliction, creating a credible need to act, but there’s no real test or risk of failure in the renaming itself. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful rise in tone than a narrowing of options or forcing of trade-offs. The ending is resonant but almost entirely free of on-page cost or resistance, which keeps conflict and stakes in the competent but not urgent band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Mira’s despair versus renewed possibility, and Elara’s need for an “encore” that releases her—are clear and aligned early. Pressure does build via the intensification of echoes and the visualisation of multiple timelines, culminating in the “Choose” moment. However, the conflict remains relatively smooth; Mira offers minimal resistance, and no substantial alternative path or sacrifice is dramatized on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful swell than a narrowing crucible with a sharply felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Mira can find a non-violating path to genuine connection after the pill debacle—is coherent but remains largely internal and conceptual. There is a meaningful tightening when she presses the crystal to her temple and begins receiving others’ emotions, which recontextualizes what “connection” could be. However, the experience is uniformly positive and reassuring; there’s no serious test of boundaries or price, so tension never truly spikes. As a result, the resolution feels like a thoughtful pivot rather than a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Maren remains a passive documenter or embraces an active, almost priestly role as the world’s voice—and it’s signaled and followed through. Pressure escalates when she engages the fossil more fully via the tidal pool and discovers non-human emotional residue, which forces a revaluation of her purpose. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely contemplative, with minimal external or relational pressure and little sense of risk if she chose differently. The piece reads more as a beautifully rendered realization than a tested choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is largely philosophical: will prophecy remain a static, elite artifact or become a living, distributed system through Elara’s work. There is almost no direct resistance—other archivists’ skepticism is mentioned but never stages a clash, and the High Seers accept her system without friction—so conflict remains notional. The key labor (“spent the following weeks unscrambling”) is elided, which flattens escalation and cost. As a result, pressure never really tightens; the story unfolds as a graceful explanation rather than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stakes—exposing the conspiracy and proving her courage—are clearly signaled, and the decision to meet in an exposed place against instinct is a nice early tightening. However, after she reads the snow codes, external pressure plateaus: the arrival of the other spy brings tension but no real test or reversal beyond a brief evaluative pause. The final act of handing over the pillbox is thematically charged but comes without a felt price or narrowed alternatives on the page (no visible threat, counter-offer, or time squeeze). Conflict thus reads as more contemplative than escalating, with limited concrete cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, centered on how to understand and inhabit the promise and his vocation. There is a faint escalation—from youthful confusion to mature clarity, from general waiting to boarding the barge—but the story does not stage a real dilemma or trade-off where options narrow. Stakes remain conceptual and unthreatened; nothing in the present moment meaningfully tests his convictions. As a result, tension is low even by quiet-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to understand why this place resisted burning and what to do with that knowledge—is clear and sustained, but operates mostly on an internal, contemplative level. There is one meaningful deepening: when she looks through the lantern glass and sees the overlapping timelines, which tightens the thematic stakes by making the oasis’s memory visibly real. However, the pressure does not markedly escalate; there’s little sense of competing options or tangible risk beyond whether she will properly receive and carry this gentleness forward. The resolution is earned and resonant, but the conflict never fully sharpens into a genuinely costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to live with and transmit hope after loss—is clear but the pressure on it is gentle, with little sense that any choice here could go badly wrong. There is some escalation: the piece moves from solitary contemplation of the dead rose to the live test of helping a newly bereaved child, culminating in the concrete act of planting. Maren’s decision to be honest (“Probably,” not a guarantee) is a nice, small-cost choice that avoids easy consolation. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed; nothing seriously resists her intention, so tension operates more as emotional ache than as sharpened dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconfigure her relationship to extinction and solitude—is clear and the pressure deepens from passive witnessing to an active, risky re-meaning of her burden. Escalation is largely internal: the sundial’s reflections, the recognition that each prior self carried the same weight, and the appearance of a new volume that could redefine extinction. The cost (letting go of a purely mournful identity and accepting responsibility as a “carrier of the new”) is present but remains conceptual rather than being tested against a more concrete dilemma. The story’s quiet, lyric mode works, but an additional on-page tension point could have sharpened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how Mira understands and uses her gift for others’ confessions—is interesting but remains low-pressure and largely unopposed. The only meaningful tightening is the discovery of the nest, which catalyzes insight rather than forcing a fraught decision. There is no real contest between competing values (e.g., preserving others’ privacy vs. exposing their words) dramatized on the page; the installation idea arrives smoothly and is accepted without visible struggle or risk. As a result, tension feels more like gentle musing than genuine escalation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the campus will remain hijacked by divisive cosmic manipulation—is clear and scaled appropriately. Yet the pressure line is relatively flat: once Maya understands the interference, there are no serious setbacks, moral tradeoffs, or visible near-failures; her countermeasure works on the first try. The “too gentle/too aggressive” calibration risk is mentioned but never dramatized as a real test. As a result, the conflict reads more like an elegant puzzle than a tightening noose, and the final victory feels low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—confronting claustrophobia to secure the key and honor her grandfather’s unfinished quest—are clear early and carried through. The organ-induced paralysis provides the main escalation: it briefly forecloses forward motion until she reframes its purpose and chooses to push on. Internal and external conflict interweave well, but the external pressure is relatively soft, with little sense of real danger or potential loss beyond discomfort and inherited duty. A sharper sense of risk or a moment where she nearly fails would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether anything meaningful can be recovered when evidence and justice are gone—is compelling but expressed almost entirely as premise rather than evolving conflict. Elena encounters no resistance, dilemma, or reversal: she arrives with a clear method, executes it smoothly, and leaves with her stance essentially unchanged. The internal conflict between solving crimes and offering peace is more told than tested, so there’s little escalation in pressure or narrowing of options. This leaves the story emotionally resonant but dramatically flat in terms of stakes and intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will continue her great-grandmother’s enforced silence or risk institutional backlash—is clear and escalates as she deciphers the journals. The key tightening comes with the realization of a century-long theft and the recognition that the senior researchers will block any publication, forcing a moral choice. However, most antagonistic pressure is inferred rather than dramatized; we never see the institution actively push back in-scene. The final decision to rise and act carries weight but could benefit from one more concrete, immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are primarily existential and thematic—how to live with vanishing and impossible testimony—rather than concrete, and they escalate by revelation rather than through contested choices. The hitchhiker’s disappearance is a strong inciting jolt, but after that the pressure remains relatively soft: she finds the flake, witnesses the vision, then adopts her new stance without much resistance or alternative path. There is a meaningful deepening when she understands what her years on bridges have been for, but no real on-page test of that commitment. As a result, tension is present but muted for a piece aiming at elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict—sell to erase a failed startup versus preserve its lived “territory” by dissolving and rebuilding with the same people—is coherent and well signaled. Pressure escalates modestly through the philosophical reframing rather than through sharp reversals; the main tightening is Elena’s “So what do we do instead?” forcing Marcus into a concrete alternative. The cost of refusing the acquisition is clear conceptually but not dramatized in immediate, visceral terms, which keeps the stakes feeling a bit abstract. Overall, the conflict works but never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s stance toward knowledge—hoarded versus shared—and it’s signaled clearly in Maren’s injunction “Don’t decode them alone.” Yet escalation is mostly intellectual: there’s no concrete threat, deadline, or relational friction to tighten options, so accepting the shared burden reads like the only plausible path rather than a hard-won choice. The piece would gain from one sharper moment where continuing in solitude is actively tempting or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—undo the curse and transform his failure into something fertile—is clear, but the conflict plays out with minimal resistance or escalation; every step works essentially as anticipated. The main tightening is the shattering of the ice dome into dangerous-sounding shards, yet Kaelen “does not flinch” and has “calculated the precise moment,” which blunts suspense. Emotional stakes are higher than physical ones, but his internal struggle is mostly front-loaded and then resolved smoothly once the ritual works. As a result, the story satisfies but doesn’t quite press him into a genuinely costly or conflicted choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will accept and enact the eclipsed covenant as the future arrives early—is clear, and there is a meaningful turn when she chooses to “heed the old call” and plant the clipping. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and largely ceremonial; alternatives to acceptance never gain real traction on the page. Escalation is more atmospheric (eclipse deepening, hum in her chest) than oppositional, so tension feels like a graceful swell rather than a tightening vise. The ending reads as inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will truly pay the price to release her sister’s spirit and what that will mean for her own wholeness—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates as she moves from corridor to orchard to the singular golden-apple tree and finally confronts the apparition: the abstract bargain becomes immediate, forcing her to live with the visible absence of her joy. Agency is present in her continuing forward despite tremors and in letting the card fall, completing the trade rather than clinging to an illusion of full resurrection. The conflict is primarily internal and resolutely quiet, but the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain insulated in factual appraisal work or risk re-engaging with his past life and grief—is clear early and tightens when the amp message arrives. The internal conflict between safety and purpose escalates through his handling of the cloth, staring at the phone, and cycling it off and on, culminating in a concrete decision. The cost (re-exposure to the site of the band’s success and the singer’s death) is implicit but weighty. Another small external pressure beat could have heightened the sense of narrowing options, but what’s here is strong for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s haunted ambition will resolve into grasping for legacy or into a purer form of understanding—is clear but more internal than situational. Pressure is largely pre-scene (the arduous journey, earlier doubts) and summarized; once at the arbor, events unfold smoothly with little opposition, risk, or hard trade-off on the page. Her internal renunciation at the end is meaningful but not strongly contested in the scene, resulting in a satisfying but low-tension progression.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece largely eschews conflict: there is no opposing pressure to Asa’s work, no risk that the identities will be lost, and no real threat to her serenity or purpose. Smelting “contradictions” could be a site of tension, but on the page it is entirely harmonious and ritualized. Stakes remain abstract (preserving wonder, offering rest) and are never concretely tested or imperiled. This keeps the story from building genuine escalation or a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Margret’s stance toward walls vs. confession, signaled early through her reflections on bunkers and sharpened at the pool. Pressure does intensify as she moves from detached inspector to someone confronted with raw human confessions, and the “heartbeat of a hesitation” is the main tightening beat. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and fairly gentle; there is minimal friction, danger, or competing obligation pushing back on her choice. The ending feels more like an unopposed realization than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can find a way to live with her mind post-breakdown without medication—is clear, and the discovery/reading of the graffiti is the primary tightening beat. Pressure is predominantly internal and contemplative, with escalation occurring via the reweighting of familiar metaphors (rivers, flooding, mending) rather than external obstacles. The price she pays is accepting that flooding is part of her, not a moral failure, which forecloses the fantasy of total control or retroactive undoing. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-temperature; a more palpable present-tense risk or decision could heighten tension without breaking the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the library before the watch stops—is clearly stated but only loosely tested. Escalation is mostly in atmosphere and information (backward-spinning hands, future writing) rather than in tightening choices or genuine risk of failure. The protagonist’s agency is present (she chooses to follow the watch, document, open the door) but these choices are not framed as trade-offs with visible consequences. As a result, tension remains intellectual and textural rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—choosing between an empire of scholarly renown and her suppressed musical vocation—is clear and present early. Escalation comes through the coffee-ground vision delineating two futures and the implicit time limit before the “promise lost its glow.” However, the pressure stays largely internal and contemplative, without a sharp on-page tightening or visible sacrifice beyond the implied risk of choosing longing. The final act of playing a note crystallizes stance but doesn’t fully dramatize the costs or narrow options in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the last spark before oblivion—is clearly signaled and ties naturally to Mira’s role and the chip. Yet pressure does not truly escalate: the spark “threatens to fade,” but there are no concrete setbacks, near-failures, or costs that alter her tactics. Conflict remains mostly conceptual and spiritual, with no antagonist beyond gentle entropy, so the climax feels more like a foregone culmination of competence than a contested win. The piece would benefit from one real moment where failure feels plausibly imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s search for contentment after a profound act of forgiveness—is conceptually rich but dramatically under-pressured. Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely reflective; the betrayal and its risk to the grotto are powerful but safely quarantined in past-tense summary, so current options never feel sharply foreclosed. The “tightening” consists mainly of climbing higher and noticing the scallop pattern in a new way, which leads smoothly to realization but without much sense of risk or genuine dilemma. As a result, escalation and visible cost at the moment of closure feel muted, more like serene clarification than a pressured trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    On-page pressure is low: the Thomas conflict is entirely off-stage, and the current scene is essentially a debrief and quiet prelude. The dominant stake—Mara’s relationship to doubt and certainty—never comes under serious threat in the present; she doesn’t face a genuine dilemma so much as reaffirm an existing philosophy. The chime message of “something new” gestures at future stakes but doesn’t force a concrete trade-off now. As a result, escalation reads as modest deepening rather than a meaningful tightening with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and spiritual—whether and how Mina can receive the forbidden teaching—and this is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the successive rings, which escalate from vague shift to personal memory to future vision, but the escalation remains gentle rather than fraught. The key tightening is Mina’s realization and her choice to act without direct instruction, accepting a lifelong path of learning/withholding. Stakes feel meaningful within the contemplative frame, though they never bite sharply as personal loss or dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and philosophical, centered on whether movement and navigation are bodily or spiritual. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate: the birds’ patterns and the pulse reaching its apex are described as familiar, rhythmic, and ritualized rather than dangerous or altering her options. Her sense that the tower is both “prison and sanctuary” could be a compelling crux, but no real alternative is brought to a point of decision or renunciation on the page. The result is a beautiful mood piece with minimal felt jeopardy or trade-off, which limits its competitive punch.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Mira’s status as an “underachieving” mage versus a deeper, non-standardized magic—and that stake is at least clearly signaled. The arrival of the keystone and the mist-walking serve as an escalation, moving her from passive maintenance into an irrevocable new context. However, conflict is largely frictionless: she never truly resists, risks, or loses anything concrete, and no serious alternative path is tested or foreclosed on the page. As a result, tension is present but gentle, more wonder than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict is largely internal—his need to force meaning versus the necessity of passive receptivity—and that stake is clear and consistently pressed. Escalation is modest but present: three years of futile effort culminate in the meteor/lantern hush, which functions as a decisive deepening rather than a reversal. The price is more spiritual than practical, centered on surrendering his illusion of control; there’s no serious threat of loss beyond his private disappointment, which keeps the pressure quiet. Within that register, the crystallization of his stance at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical: Kira’s stake is understanding her purpose in a changed universe. Pressure does accumulate texturally via the denser static and her focused casting, but there’s no meaningful external opposition and only a soft deadline. The realization at the end doesn’t visibly foreclose an alternative path or impose a concrete price; it’s a reframing more than a hard-won stance under duress. As a result, tension is pleasant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can continue reaping while honestly carrying her own grief—is clear and tied to her professional mandate. Escalation occurs as Elias’s voice reframes her method and prompts the active naming of fears, culminating in her decision to carry this new map into the night. Tension remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s no strong sense of a live alternative path (e.g., refusal, collapse, or clinging to numbness) being pressed on the page. As a result, the cost at the peak reads quiet and thematic rather than acutely felt in a single pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether the village regains its livelihood—is clear and tied to the mage’s success or failure in repairing the bell. Escalation comes mostly through duration and exhaustion as “the work took hours” and his “magic felt thin and stretched,” which provides some cost. However, the process is remarkably smooth; there’s no failed attempt, doubt, or external interruption that truly narrows options or forces a painful trade-off. The resolution feels somewhat assured once he identifies dripping rates, which softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this erased town’s story will remain buried or be reclaimed in memory—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure does deepen somewhat as more of the town resurfaces and she discovers the cache of bottles, prompting her explicit decision to curate meaning via photographs. However, there’s limited sense of options closing or of a real trade-off; bureaucracy is gestured at (“what should be buried again”) but never tests her on the page. The result is textured but relatively low-tempo conflict with minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reconcile knowledge and wonder before the “final transformation”—is present from early on and thematically escalates as birds, crystal, and flame converge. Pressure increases texturally rather than through sharp turns; the starlings’ patterns and the crystal’s inner fire mark a deepening rather than a true narrowing of options. Her agency is real but largely internal: choosing to read with her heart, to let the mask fall, to accept a result different from her calculations. Because there’s no substantive threat of failure or visible external consequence, tension remains relatively low despite the lush build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s safety and the preservation of trust—is clearly signaled and tied to the storm and radio silence. There is one meaningful tightening when the cold front shifts and forces revised calculations, and the heading change is a clean, agentive beat. However, the conflict resolves smoothly with no real reversal or near-failure; we’re never asked to feel that she might plausibly be lost, which keeps the cost abstract. Internal and external pressures align well but don’t quite escalate to a truly searing test.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can break numbness without annihilating the clone or themselves—is signaled early and threads through the confrontation. Escalation is modest but present: verbal challenge → drawing the blade → choosing to use it on the clone’s chest, where the risk of true harm is palpable. The cost at closure (accepting ongoing partial numbness and a permanent, separate Other as necessary to wholeness) is conceptually clear, though not viscerally dramatized. Most tension remains internal and philosophical rather than sharply dramatized in concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s struggle between commercial pressures and her commitment to radical, slow-blooming innovation—is clear but remains largely abstract. There is some escalation as investor and critic expectations mount, and as the seed refuses to sprout, but these pressures are told rather than dramatized in scenes of conflict. Her “response” (redesigning toward possibility spaces and accepting the seed’s non-bloom) is conceptually meaningful but never feels like a hard trade-off with visible cost. The result is thoughtful but low-tension, with limited sense of narrowing options or real sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter to a grief-stricken household—is clearly stated but remains abstractly held. There is little on-page escalation: each pull of the cord is framed as another “phrase” in the same symphony, yet we never see the pressure tighten or a tactic shift in response to resistance or doubt. The conductor encounters no setbacks and makes no consequential trade-offs besides patient endurance. As a result, the conflict feels static rather than deepening toward the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she remains in static, haunted waiting or steps into the unknown—and it is clearly signaled. The pendant’s arrival and activation provide one genuine deepening of pressure. However, escalation is relatively gentle: once the pendant is used, there’s little friction or real possibility that she will choose to keep waiting, so the choice feels low-resistance. The stakes remain meaningful but more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can finally crack the problem and interrupt her “stifling destiny”—is clear from early on and narrows through the realization that the crozier must be unmade as catalyst. There is one solid tightening beat when hours of failure and creeping frost push her to reconceive the crozier’s role, and the cost of burning the relic is evident. However, the conflict remains largely internal and philosophical, with little active resistance or complication beyond the pattern of failure, so escalation feels more like an elegant gear shift than a truly sharpened crucible. The pressure is coherent and satisfying, but not quite fierce enough for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal and spiritual: can Mara receive and interpret a once-in-a-lifetime kind of signal. There is a clear tightening when the “perfect geometric silence” appears and she must choose between conventional measuring and her more intuitive tuning method. However, opposition is minimal and there’s little sense of risk, sacrifice, or alternative outcome—the revelation arrives smoothly once she makes the “right” interpretive choice. The lack of tangible or sharply felt cost at the peak keeps the conflict from fully biting, even for a quiet, contemplative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing a dangerous timeline merge so commuters aren’t harmed—is clear, and the radio’s escalating urgency provides a meaningful tightening. Maren’s agency at the intersection point is central; she chooses to risk herself to hold the connection, and that act resolves the situation. However, the on-page sense of danger flattens: the risk of being scattered across realities is described, but the actual climactic beat plays out smoothly, with no felt wobble, near-miss, or sacrifice that alters her options thereafter. As a result, stakes are conceptually high but experientially moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether and at what cost she continues to build experiences that erode her own sense of reality. Pressure does escalate—her reflections on false memories lead into the gallery’s autonomous “eruption,” and she must decide whether to stop or ride it out. Still, the conflict never sharpens into a clearly framed dilemma or significant trade-off; she endures rather than actively choosing between competing harms. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-intensity progression of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether humanity can learn to navigate the expanded cosmos without their alien guides—is clear but remains mostly conceptual. Pressure does tighten once with the message that the visitors are leaving, which retroactively sharpens her night’s work. However, there is no concrete dilemma or trade-off forced on the page; Mira’s response is a quiet acceptance rather than a choice with visible cost. The result is thoughtful tension without a strong sense of escalation or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—bridging the gap between Vera and Margot, and more broadly between the living and their dead—is clearly cued and emotionally legible. There is one main tightening when Elena pushes past the heartbeat into the “spaces between beats” and uncovers the voice, prompting her to leave the safety of the lab and act. Yet external resistance is minimal, and the risks of running into the misty atrium are more implied than dramatized; nothing on the page pushes back against her or forces a painful trade-off. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than truly escalating, and the final stance reads as an earned insight more than a pressured, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stakes—escape vs. merging with the cable consciousness—are conceptually strong, and the internal conflict between claustrophobia and the lure of understanding has potential. However, escalation is mostly informational (revelation of voices and Elara’s fate) rather than pressure-based; Maren meets no real obstacles or reversals as she moves from arrival to dissolution. The tidal window and physical danger never tighten into a true dilemma at the climax, so the choice feels more like a serene acceptance than a hard-won trade-off. As a result, tension at the sentence and scene level remains relatively low despite high abstract stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need for understanding and release from the error that erased her—is clear, and the ritual offers a focused situation. Pressure does deepen as the ghost’s fragments are organized and the Comforter constellation appears, culminating in her stance shift. However, escalation is mostly internal and retrospective; within the on-page scene there are few reversals or sharpened dilemmas, so the tension arc feels more like a gentle rise than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can harness the death of a language and her cursed diamond into a new form of speech—is clear, and tension does gently tighten as she moves from observation to intervention. However, escalation is primarily conceptual and atmospheric; there’s no sharp beat where a real option might fail, nor a visible price for acting versus not acting, so pressure never fully spikes. Her final action feels inevitable rather than contested, which softens the sense of risk or sacrifice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes are epistemic and existential rather than physical: whether Mira will accept and step into this new, reality-altering understanding of the creature and their research. Pressure does increase as the garden responds and the creature manifests, but Mira is never forced into a sharply bounded dilemma or visible sacrifice; her decision to step forward is powerful but relatively unopposed. Amari’s transformed state and the academic world’s scorn are mostly contextual, not active antagonists in the scene. The piece would benefit from one more concrete, risky consequence attached to her final move.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict and stakes are present but gentle; the primary question is whether Elara can reawaken dormant beauty, with the statues’ attention as a soft external pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when the statues “begin to move,” but they never threaten refusal or harm—instead they quickly reveal themselves as kin, which undercuts potential tension. The internal stake (risking herself, her instrument, or the shell) is never sharply framed, so the act of playing feels like fulfillment rather than a risky or costly stand. The result is a lovely escalation in mood but a relatively low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear—illegal smuggling across a dangerous border, life-or-death medicine, and emotional survival for Vera and the sisters—but they’re experienced mostly in concept rather than concrete pressure. Marcus’s key choice (accepting Aram’s package and adding the storm) is ethically weighty yet faces little active resistance: no patrol appears, no near-miss, no one contradicts him. The ethical calculus (rules vs. people) is strong but not seriously contested in the moment. As a result, conflict escalates gently rather than sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are the weakest dimension: the piece is almost entirely receptive and wonder-driven, with no real opposition, dilemma, or risk. The dominant tension is whether and how he will respond to this strange invitation, but there’s no moment where he might refuse or where embracing it visibly threatens his hard-won equilibrium. The one genuine “test” beat is his decision to sing to the fragment, yet even that carries no felt danger or trade-off. As a result, escalation reads more like a gentle unveiling than a tightening of pressure, which is a significant liability at the level of immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam can reawaken the analog memories bound in the scarf—is clear but low-pressure. Once she “understood, suddenly, what she must do,” the path to success is smooth; the ritual behaves like a reliable procedure rather than a risky attempt. There’s no opposing force, time pressure, or ethical tension to narrow her options or exact a price. As a result, conflict exists in concept but not in felt escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether unmoored longings (including Mira’s own) can be given rest—is clear and tight. Pressure deepens when the “runaway dream” appears and turns the established pattern back on the protagonist, forcing her to treat herself as one of the haunted subjects. Conflict is primarily internal and aesthetic rather than oppositional, so the escalation reads as one strong intensification rather than a sequence of tested choices. The cost (accepting a captured, not cured, longing) is present but understated, keeping tension more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will she finally access and free the philosopher’s sealed idea, validating a life-defining quest—is legible and emotionally grounded. Pressure arises from the accumulated years of pursuit and the possibility she has been “simply mad,” but within the on-page night there is minimal escalation: no meaningful obstacles, reversals, or narrowed options as she works. Her agency (choosing to trust the star’s hint, to keep the hair, to work through the night) is clear, yet the conflict remains largely internal and gently modulated. The resolution feels earned but low-intensity, with the cost residing more in backstory than in active, scene-level struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—regaining stolen memories of his grandmother and the old ways—is clear and emotionally resonant, and his endurance in the ring’s light until the Heron scatters provides a quiet, credible cost. However, on-page pressure is relatively low: there is no real risk that the attempt will fail or hurt him, nor any opposing force beyond history and his own long-ago skepticism. The main “tightening” is the Heron’s brief alignment window, which works conceptually but doesn’t quite narrow options or force a trade-off in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether these traumatized children can find a different kind of refuge and whether Maren can meet them without betraying her combative ethos—is legible and focused. Pressure coheres around the children’s entrance, Maren’s instinctive backward movement, the tense tea ritual, and the suspended moment before the boy drinks. The escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than overtly dramatized, peaking at the tiny but meaningful choice to accept the tea, which forecloses the path of immediate withdrawal. The cost and risk remain somewhat abstract and understated, which limits the felt sharpness of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as very high (the preservation of wonder across realms), but on the page nothing meaningfully resists or complicates Elara’s goal. There is no antagonist, no risk that the planting might fail, and no visible trade-off besides implicit effort and age. The escalation is primarily tonal—the ritual grows more solemn—rather than a tightening of options or rise in cost. As a result, the piece reads more like a lyrical vignette than a conflict-driven story, which is a significant limitation at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—freeing a restless, over-bound spirit without unleashing danger—is clearly signaled and tightened as knots are removed and the spirit’s presence intensifies. Escalation is controlled: we move from conceptual danger (warnings of anger) to embodied luminosity and then to the deeper, more personal revelation at the final knot. The breaking of the “interlaced hush” and her confrontation with her own past provide a credible sense of cost and transformation. The conflict’s tenor is meditative more than fraught, so tension is finely tuned rather than gripping, which keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central conflict—whether to further penetrate and possibly disturb a deliberately preserved chamber—is present but kept very quiet. There is one meaningful inflection when she chooses to document and leave the chamber as-is, but the narrative doesn’t sharply escalate pressure or articulate competing costs in the moment. Most “tension” is reflective and thematic rather than dramatized as a narrowing of options. As a result, the stakes feel more gently sketched than actively tested.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Miriam’s need to reframe loss and her attachment to the ocean, signaled early through the Earhart aftermath and loneliness. Pressure tightens when the impossible preservation of the globe implies intention, then again when the note’s message reframes death and demands an action in the world above. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, with minimal resistance or competing goals in the moment, so tension stays quiet rather than acute. Even so, the decision to take on the errand and contemplate leaving the ocean is a credible deepening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the ghost’s unspoken needs and Mira’s own longing to be heard can be given form—is clear but remains largely internal and aesthetic, with minimal opposing force beyond circumstance. Pressure does increase somewhat as the ghost’s calling continues for three nights and becomes clearest in the lightning/thunder interval, leading to Mira’s quick, careful encoding, but there’s little sense of what happens if she fails beyond continued loneliness. The final harmony is satisfying yet arrives without much real risk or hard trade-off; Mira never seriously contemplates refusal or an alternative path. Escalation therefore reads as a gentle deepening of texture rather than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether and how Mira will violate the captain’s privacy and what she does with that knowledge—is clear and reasonably pressured. There is one main tightening: the discovery of the diary leads to reading, then to harsher emotional content, then to the added revelation of a secret daughter, raising the weight of her choice to keep or reveal. However, she faces no serious external consequences or sharp moral dilemma on the page; the risk remains mostly conceptual and internal. The conflict is strong for quiet fiction but could bear one more concrete test of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam can transform her grief and shaken trust in gravity into a sustaining, meaningful practice—is legible from early on. Pressure escalates primarily through conceptual deepening: focusing on the accident site, noticing the spiral “spool of wholeness,” and committing to memorialization. The internal conflict is real but low-voltage; there is no major reversal or narrowed option beyond the emotional risk of staying in the gondola and facing the site of the fall. The result is thematically satisfying but relatively gentle in terms of felt tension and on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving/translating the library’s knowledge before demolition—is clear and tied to a ticking clock. Yet the night’s work proceeds almost entirely without friction: the safe yields, the coin’s meaning is quickly decoded, and the painting process faces no setbacks or trade-offs. The wrecking ball’s approach increases urgency texturally but never truly threatens her goal on the page. Escalation is thus more conceptual than dramatic, keeping tension in a moderate band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—intellectual discovery and professional validation—is clear but remains largely unopposed. Curiosity pulls her forward, and while exhaustion and the passage of night are mentioned, they never crystallize into a real dilemma or setback; each new observation arrives without friction. There is a small escalation when she recognizes the correlation between birds, light, and hopscotch geometry, but no true tightening that forecloses other paths or extracts a meaningful price. As a result, tension is gentle and textural rather than gripping, which is a notable limitation for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—finding the rhythm of repair and the tools to complete her sacred work—is clearly stated but rarely feels imperiled. Pressure deepens slightly when she realizes the gears must be offerings, yet she never doubts, resists, or risks loss beyond the symbolic. There is one structural tightening (the sacrifice that enables passage), but no real reversal or hard trade-off. As a result, the conflict reads as contemplative fulfillment rather than a test with palpable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether this community will remain locked in subsistence or risk collective effort for something more tender—is clear but gently handled. Escalation is mostly a slow accretion of curiosity and cooperation; there’s little real resistance, conflict, or sense that failure would hurt beyond mild disappointment. The restoration work has some frictions (“laughed and argued over proper pruning techniques”) but nothing that substantially narrows options or demands sacrifice. As a result, the bell-ringing reads as a lovely culmination rather than a pressured decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are conceptually enormous—documenting the universe’s final moment—but the conflict is largely internal and contemplative rather than sharply contested. The main tightening is the approach of the “final ripple” and her decision to begin the last adjustment and lullaby. There is little sense of alternatives or risk of failure; she never seriously wavers or faces obstruction. As a result, pressure grows more in tone and imagery than through sharply escalating choices or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—guiding the travelers out before the birds and frost trap or exhaust them—is legible and escalates via bird signals and the encroaching night. Internal and external pressures braid well: her reluctance versus her obligation, and the literal deadline. However, the path to success is relatively smooth; once she reaches the center, there’s no real reversal beyond trusting her imperfect memory. The cost of success doesn’t bite hard on the page, keeping the conflict strong but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether and how Miriam can live with her choice to prioritize work over her dying mother—is clear and quietly compelling. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening reflection and the visual complexity of the foam, culminating in a mental turn where guilt becomes a more bearable, integrated grief. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no strong mid-scene reversal or external pressure testing her stance. The result is emotionally satisfying but low-tension, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can truly locate and understand “where stories begin”—is clear but almost entirely conceptual, with no meaningful external opposition. Pressure rises modestly when she finds the special shelf of unusually glowing bottles, which sharpens her realization about parole and absence, but nothing concrete is foreclosed or risked. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully unified meditation rather than a scene where options narrow and a price is palpably paid.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether Miriam can engage with and transform an overwhelming mass of communal remorse without being consumed—emerges clearly at the first touch and gives the rest of the piece its pressure. The escalation is more in emotional density than in reversals: we move from abstract description to bodily impact, then to a sustained three-day trial, then to a quiet but weighted exit. Miriam’s agency is solid (choosing to stay, to use counter-flavors, to treat this as a job only she can do), but the narrative rarely threatens her stance or shows a near-breaking point. The stakes remain somewhat abstract and could be sharpened by a more concrete sense of danger or cost during the work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elara can restart the clock in a way that also reanimates communal bonds—is clear and thematically rich. There is one main tightening when she decides to confront Antonescu in Romanian and insist on his brother’s involvement, which credibly raises interpersonal stakes. However, resistance and consequence are smoothed over; conflicts (family estrangement, community fracture) resolve with relatively little on-page friction or cost, often in summary. Escalation exists but remains gentle rather than sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Mira will remain a conventional engineer or let the mirror’s memories reorient her life’s work, but this remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a live dilemma. Once she picks up the mirror, there is no real resistance, cost calculation, or competing obligation—she simply understands “what she was supposed to do.” The night of work passes without complications, tests, or failures, so there’s little escalation in pressure. The piece functions more as an origin vignette than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the forgotten combinations to transform archival practice—is clear, and the prior failure at the junction offers a built-in pressure point. There is one meaningful tightening when she reaches the three-way split and chooses differently than before, signaling growth. Yet after that choice, opposition and risk remain abstract: the prohibition, the danger of inversion, and the ticking clock never crystallize into a concrete dilemma or loss. The conflict therefore feels atmospheric rather than truly escalating, limiting stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can she create meaningful music in a silent world?—is present but never truly pressured. The main “escalation” is from faint tone to full resonance, a deepening of texture rather than a tightening of consequence. There’s no sense of what failure would cost her beyond a mild spiritual disappointment, and no external opposition or internal doubt to complicate the attempt. The ending therefore satisfies conceptually but lacks a felt test of commitment or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—what he will do with his exile and his “dangerous” precision—is legible, but pressure remains largely static throughout. The notion of “before the next phase” hints at a clock, yet nothing in the present scene actually forces a hard decision or forecloses a live alternative path. His final stance (accepting continued exile as his arena of teaching) is a resolution, but it isn’t sharply tested by escalating conflict. As a result, tension operates more as low, steady hum than as a tightening line.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering her life’s catalog without violence—is signaled early and coherently pursued through her choice of method. Pressure deepens via the impending fireworks and the sense of suspension, and her tuning to an “emotional register” marks a meaningful tightening. That said, the conflict never truly feels in danger of failing; there are no serious reversals or costs beyond anxiety and the threat of loss. The solution arrives somewhat smoothly once the fireworks start, making the arc feel more like an elegant reveal than a hard-won test.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict—learning serenity within motion by enduring a repulsive flower that directly attacks her strongest sense—is clear and consistent. Escalation comes from the corpse flower’s developing scent and her near-retreats versus her persistence, culminating in the bloom and her reframed perception. However, the stakes stay largely internal and relatively safe; there’s no serious risk of failure or visible external consequence beyond personal growth. Pressure is more meditative than tense, which suits the piece but keeps the conflict band modest.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Cora will exploit or safeguard the source of resilience—is legible and ties cleanly to her role as a guild pilot and the planet’s vulnerability. Pressure escalates mostly via revelation (growth acceleration, voices of past explorers) rather than through active opposition or hard constraints. Her closing choice forecloses a materially different future (profit or fame) but the cost is implied rather than dramatized as a painful trade-off. As a result, tension feels contemplative and low-intensity, strong for quiet SF but shy of top-tier narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is epistemic—whether Mira can correctly read and document the pattern behind the disaster and evacuation—rather than immediate physical danger. There is one clear tightening when she reaches the “heart of the labyrinth” and recognizes the convergence point, reframing the prior incident and the evacuation. However, on-page pressure is low: no live opposition, countdown, or concrete cost tests her commitment. The piece reads as an elegant investigation more than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential to halt the world’s “slow cooling”—is stated and conceptually high, but on-page pressure remains mostly abstract. Yara never seriously doubts, fails, or faces a concrete risk; once she arrives, each step of the ritual proceeds as intended, with escalation expressed primarily as intensifying imagery rather than new obstacles or trade-offs. There is one meaningful deepening when she realizes the sheet is a map she must follow “with her very soul,” but it doesn’t foreclose options or force a hard choice. The piece has tension via reverence, not robust conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether and how she will metabolize her failure and redefine her role—is clear and consistently held. Pressure deepens as she reaches Listener’s Crossing, uncases the flute, and explicitly confronts the Weaving’s origin and her three-heartbeat paralysis. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective, with no concrete new risk or choice that truly forecloses a live alternative path in the present. The cost is convincingly evoked but not significantly sharpened by new on-page developments.

    The declared stakes—the universe transforming, stars disappearing, and the need to encode emotional mathematics—are immense, but they stay abstract. Pressure does increase texturally (the halo pulses more as stars vanish), yet Maren encounters almost no friction or competing demand; she simply continues doing what she has always done. There is no discrete reversal or agonized trade-off, only a deepening of an already-accepted trajectory toward dissolution. As a result, tension is present but relatively low and static compared to the conceptual scale.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what Elara will do with her grief and professional identity in Mira’s absence—is clear and carries through to the ending. Pressure escalates when the pendant unexpectedly activates and Mira appears, forcing Elara to confront her story of abandonment and her uncertainty about her role. However, conflict remains largely internal and unresisted: Mira’s explanation is accepted without meaningful friction, and no real alternative path is dramatized beyond staying stuck in quiet grief. The emotional price is present but modest, keeping the tension effective but not intense.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to remain a detached interpreter versus her emergent fusion with the place—tightens as she reads new patterns (future woman, grandmother overlay) that challenge her prior stance. Escalation is subtle but present: the hush deepens, the presence returns, and the interpretive act becomes personally implicating, culminating in her acceptance that she is part of the archive she thought she only studied. The cost (loss of pure observerhood, implication in death/afterlife dynamics) is more conceptual than visceral, and there is little external friction testing her commitment. Nonetheless, the internal stance crystallization feels earned and reorders her options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether she will pay the ultimate personal price to send the message—is legible and the pressure tightens as the raveling silence accelerates and the bead’s glow intensifies. Her final act of unraveling herself into the tapestry is clearly a costly, irrevocable choice. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and is handled with a kind of serene inevitability; we’re told this is “the one thing she had kept protected,” but we don’t really see her resist, bargain, or falter in the moment. The escalation is present and coherent but could use one sharper beat of genuine struggle or competing value.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes—whether a dead world can be coaxed back into life by one man’s persistence—are clear and emotionally legible, and the surfacing seedlings function as a meaningful tightening of hope and consequence. Cael’s agency drives all turns (choosing to descend, to keep clearing, to engineer the root lattice), but most opposition is environmental and social in a diffuse way rather than manifesting in acute tests or reversals. Because much of the struggle is reported rather than dramatized under immediate pressure, escalation feels more thematic than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can change the outcome / redirect the flow versus facing the true nature of her wound—is clear and escalates as she moves from seeking her mentor’s answer to realizing she herself is the source of the pattern. The activation of the shard and vision of her alternate self provide a meaningful tightening in knowledge. However, the conflict stays largely contemplative and never quite forces a hard on-page trade-off or visible forfeiture. Tension is steady and coherent but not especially cutting at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—whether the haunted, mourning lighthouse will resume guiding ships and whether the dead will be acknowledged—are clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure escalates from eerie stone stacks to a spiritual/ethical imperative once the letters and ship graveyard are revealed. However, Maren encounters little real resistance (internal or external) once she understands what’s happening; there’s no significant risk of failure or competing demand, so the climax feels gentle rather than taut. The resolution is earned but low-friction for a piece aiming at top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nominal stakes—three ships’ survival, the balance between tempest and safe harbor—are huge, but on the page the process feels frictionless and assured. There is no real sense that he might fail, that the storm could outstrip him, or that his joy could lapse and cost lives. Internal conflict (burden vs. purpose) is stated but never forces an on-page trade-off or renunciation. As a result, pressure doesn’t notably tighten; the story escalates in luminosity, not in risk.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether Yuen will find a meaningful frame for his new heart and his obsession with story-magnetizers—is present but largely contemplative. Pressure accrues gently through his fixation on the wing and donor, and there is a discernible tightening when he identifies the pattern of “accumulation” and recognizes his own potential role. Yet there is little sense that alternatives or consequences are truly in play; no credible option is foreclosed or materially costly. Conflict remains mostly abstract and unopposed, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and mapping human sorrow embedded in the labyrinth—is clear but remains largely contemplative, with low visible risk or opposition. There is a meaningful deepening when she actively “begins to deconstruct the labyrinth’s pattern” and the structure unfolds like fabric; that realization tightens the conceptual stakes and leads to the morning decision to unmake as a form of maintenance. However, pressure barely escalates beyond an initial mood of solemn duty; neither the storm nor the labyrinth actively pushes back. The cost of her stance crystallization is mostly thematic, not dramatized as a trade-off or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm at the likely expense of Elara’s selfhood—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates as her ritual moves from preparatory (swaddling, chanting) to irreversible sacrifice, culminating in her memories burning to fuel the dawn. However, external opposition is minimal; the conflict is almost entirely internal and cosmological, which keeps tension more contemplative than gripping. The cost is real but could be sharpened by a more concrete sense of what she stands to lose beyond an abstracted “fragmented self.”

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—self-protective hiding vs answering her dying mother’s call—is well established and emotionally legible. Pressure accumulates via the ticking clock and her re-reading of the invitation, culminating in her resolve to respond. However, escalation is mostly reflective; we don’t see a concrete near-refusal or a new external complication that sharply narrows her options. The cost is felt but not deeply tested on the page, keeping tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can find/accept grace in a decaying, forgotten place—is clear but remains low-intensity throughout. The bread’s appearance and the butterfly’s emergence deepen the emotional texture, yet they don’t significantly tighten pressure or foreclose a live option; she never seriously entertains rejecting the bread or abandoning her duties. The resolution (continuing as before, with slightly reweighted meaning) is emotionally honest but not strongly tested. As a result, conflict reads more contemplative than escalatory, limiting stakes at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the vows can be preserved before they fade—is articulated early and tightened by the discovery that they are not merely fading but transforming. The main escalation is internal and epistemic: her understanding shifts from “loss to oblivion” to “evolution into story,” which does reweight the situation. However, the conflict remains largely abstract and contemplative, with minimal on-page sense of risk, trade-off, or genuine dilemma once the new interpretation appears. As a result, tension feels steady and gently deepening rather than genuinely sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will trade the watch for knowledge of her father’s fate—is clear, and the arrival of the scarred woman tightens the pressure. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective; the piece builds anticipation but stops at the brink of action, leaving the decisive cost off-page. Her question “What happens if I keep it?” is an effective sharpening of the dilemma but is never translated into a concrete choice or visible loss. As a result, tension remains atmospheric rather than fully knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Mira will remain a skeptic of the unmeasurable or allow for wonder—and this is signaled early and followed through. However, conflict and escalation are gentle: Seren’s arrival brings information and resonance more than genuine pressure or a tough trade-off. The convergence builds nicely as a textural tightening, but no option feels meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, the piece reads as contemplative rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—Mira versus her own inherited/suppressed creativity and guilt—is clearly signaled and tightens as she moves from recollection to direct engagement with the unfinished portrait. The main escalation comes from realizing her quiet disapproval was the true “lock” on Elena’s art, which reframes her task in the chamber. However, pressure stays mostly contemplative; there’s limited sense that she might walk away or choose differently, which softens the felt cost. One concrete external or relational consequence of her choice to begin would intensify the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira engages with this hidden reservoir of honesty—is coherent and sharpened by the师傅 backstory. The story tightens once she deciphers the coordinates and enters the room, where she must decide between passive witnessing and active continuation. However, her journey is almost frictionless: the tunnels pose no danger, no one opposes her, and internal resistance is minimal, so escalation is more a gentle deepening than true pressure. The cost of her choice (social, personal, or practical) is implied but not concretely felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can realize and preserve a truthful, wonder-bearing sculpture—is clear but only gently pressured. There is a mild escalation from description of her lifelong work to the unveiling and communal “listening” as the piece begins to move, yet no real threat or viable alternative outcome is staged. Her choice to be “satisfied” and continue tuning across seasons carries a conceptual endurance cost but faces no sharp on-page test. The conflict remains largely abstract and contemplative rather than dynamically escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the roses and surviving the magnetic chaos without losing herself—is introduced early and escalates as standard repair options fail. The turn to “miniaturize the chaos” via a controlled burn is a genuine narrowing of options driven by Cara’s agency and history as a container of fears. Internal and external conflicts braid well: saving the roses requires risking greater inner fragmentation. The only slight limit is that resistance or trade-off is more emotional than tactical; the outcome comes somewhat smoothly once the method is chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes are emotional and communal—whether hidden, unsent communications will remain buried or be witnessed and potentially heal old wounds. However, the conflict remains mostly low-friction: no one strongly resists, there are no real obstacles to opening the box or sharing the letters, and the reunion happens smoothly off-stage. Escalation is more a deepening of information than a narrowing of options, and Elena never faces a difficult trade-off; she simply continues to do what she’s inclined to do. This keeps the piece gentle and contemplative but limits tension and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberation and, implicitly, the release of a forbidden cure—is clear and integrated with her long-term strategy. There is one main tightening: the completion of the dance sequence and the chamber’s mechanical response, shifting the situation from submerged stasis to a newly opened path. However, the pressure curve is relatively flat; we never feel that the mechanism might fail, that she is running out of air, or that an external force might intervene. The conflict functions more as a retrospective triumph than as a live, escalating contest, which keeps this from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering her mother’s deleted memory and locating where forgotten things go—is clearly stated, and the move into the densest gravity pocket is a meaningful tightening. However, opposition is largely environmental and internalized; there is little sense of real risk or trade-off beyond abstract emotional danger, and she encounters no reversals en route. Her agency is mostly in deciding to descend and then to touch the crystal, both of which feel foregone rather than contested. As a result, tension is steady but muted, more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—wresting agency back from an imposed prophecy—is clear, but plays out almost entirely as an inward, procedural escalation rather than a sharp conflict. Pressure deepens when the silence reveals the prophecy as a future self’s plea, adding a moral and emotional dimension to what began as a technical problem. Her “turn” is choosing to receive the warning without letting it calcify into destiny, which is thematically satisfying but low in overt friction. The absence of countervailing on-page forces (no active court, seers, or time constraint in scene) keeps tension fairly gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will pierce the veil of “agreed-upon lies” or choose to live within them—is legible and tightens toward the rooftop scene. The interrogation and subsequent renunciation (“I don’t need to know”) are clear turns that reconfigure the relationship and Elena’s stance toward knowledge. Pressure is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational, but it does escalate: curiosity becomes necessity, and then a moral/emotional choice about respect vs. revelation. The cost of her decision is implied more than viscerally felt, which keeps the tension refined rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—Mira’s rational armor versus the shell’s impossible evidence and the burden of her grandmother’s “delusional” legacy—is clear and coherently escalated as the whispers intensify into dialogue. Stakes stay intimate but real: whether she will reframe death, memory, and Elena’s disappearance, and risk becoming what the institution mocked. Her decision to embrace the archive and take on the quest to complete it provides a solid tightening and resolution. The struggle is largely internal and unfolds smoothly; a sharper moment of resistance or visible risk would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to collude in official erasure or restore buried truth—is clear but remains mostly conceptual, with minimal on-page opposition or risk. Escalation is gentle: arrival, revelation of hidden texts, the discovery that the “chest” is a wall, then her decision to carry knowledge instead of documents. The lack of a concrete counterforce (no danger, surveillance, or interpersonal clash) keeps tension from tightening beyond a meditative register.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—learning what was done to the echo people and possibly how to restore them—is articulated, but it stays abstract and largely offstage. Pressure rises modestly via the approaching celestial crest and the shell’s new behavior, culminating in the step into the song. However, there’s no sharp test of resolve, trade-off, or visible loss; the story stops at the threshold of conflict rather than pushing Elara into a costly choice. As a result, tension remains lyrical and suggestive more than gripping or escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes revolve around whether the child’s fragmented, haunting presence in strangers’ dreams will be given coherent remembrance, which is conceptually rich but dramatically under-pressured. There is no substantive opposition to her goal—no resisting force, time pressure, or ethical dilemma that tests her commitment. Escalation comes mainly as accumulating information (identifying the girl, tracing the mother) rather than tightening options or raising visible cost. As a result, tension remains low and the climax reads more like a gentle thematic reveal than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is largely internal and contemplative, centered on how Yuki positions herself toward hidden labor and her own “strange” way of seeing, with minimal external pressure. The primary tightening is the move from observation and memory into the risky, slightly foolish-feeling decision to whistle again, testing whether her childhood pattern-making still holds. That act and the fireflies’ response do reconfigure her stance, but the stakes remain small-scale and never quite feel contested in real time. The piece reads more as a lyrical meditation than as a scene of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira uncovering and accurately transmitting the truth beneath competing narratives—is clear and thematically weighty. Pressure escalates conceptually as the “curse” is reframed first as dangerous mythmaking, then as protective obfuscation of a risky experiment, and finally as data encoded in the diamond. However, conflict is mostly intellectual and institutional, with little on-page resistance, danger, or time pressure to force difficult tactical choices. The result is rich but somewhat low-torque; each turn deepens knowledge more than it visibly narrows Mira’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s desire to validate her dangerous theories and find meaning/hope in the prophecies—is clear but remains mostly internal and abstract. Escalation tracks structurally (more prophecies, storm intensifies, new ominous line, portico cracks, prophet appears), yet Elara’s agency is limited to witnessing and mild approach rather than difficult choice or trade-off. There’s little sense of what she could lose or foreclose in this moment; the arrival feels more like a reward than a pressured outcome. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than truly biting.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is existential—what his life’s collecting has really been for—and it is signaled early through his jars and coast-wandering, then deepened by the music box revelation. The key escalation is conceptual rather than situational: he moves from “sound archivist” to “translator of relationships,” and that choice visibly forecloses his prior self-conception. However, the pressure on him is relatively gentle; there’s little sense that he might resist giving the box away or that he struggles against alternative paths. As a result, the conflict feels more like a graceful unfolding than a genuinely tightened crucible with sharply felt on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the ice maelstrom—is legible and scaled appropriately for the scene. Time pressure (twelve minutes until sunset) and the crystal’s warping tone create a solid escalation, but the actual tuning sequence resolves without a true setback or difficult trade-off. Internal fear and external danger do interweave, yet the outcome feels fairly assured once she starts using the key. The price paid is mainly exhaustion and ongoing responsibility, not a sharp on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—bringing about a “patient revolution” by unyoking ancient energies—is intriguing but remains abstract and largely uncontested. There is no real setback or counterforce; the viaduct “calls,” she answers, the energies release, and nothing on the page resists or threatens her goal. The main pressure is temporal (waiting years for the moment), which is conceptually rich but dramatically underleveraged in-scene. As a result, escalation feels like a steady swell rather than a pressured narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will allow another death to be buried or will expose institutional wrongdoing—is clear, and her final decision to create independent archives provides resolution. Pressure does rise somewhat from routine investigation to uncanny memory intrusion to recognition of present-day institutional rot. Yet much of the escalation is conceptual rather than dramatized; Chen never appears, no concrete threat or obstacle tests her resolve, and the memory transmission hands her answers rather than forcing difficult choices under uncertainty. The cost of defiance remains mostly implied, so tension never truly tightens into a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether a simple mechanical repair can meaningfully address layered grief—is clear, and Thomas’s pause before repairing marks a genuine tightening of internal pressure. Reflection on Marcus Webb reframes the conflict in terms of grace versus deserving, which does deepen what’s at stake in his choice. However, escalation remains almost entirely interior and contemplative; no option feels truly dangerous or foreclosed, so the final choice, while right for the piece’s quiet mode, doesn’t land as a costly trade-off. Tension is present but never fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—achieving understanding and ringing the unheard bell—is present from early on and fulfilled at the end. Escalation exists in the deepening obsession with transliteration and the eventual unique image of the bell, which is a genuine pattern break. Yet conflict is largely internal and under-opposed: other cart gliders’ skepticism is summarized, not dramatized, and no serious alternative path or risk is put on the page. As a result, the climax feels more like a smooth culmination than a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will recover Yuki’s dispersed consciousness/work or collude in its erasure—is clear by the end and thematically rich. Escalation is mostly informational and pattern-based: recurring 47s, then hidden coordinates, then the suppressed Prometheus data, culminating in the realization that Yuki is still “alive” in the system. However, the pressure remains largely abstract; the company’s expectations and potential retaliation are implied but never concretely dramatized, and Maren’s final action (beginning to trace the files) is not framed against a sharpened, immediate risk. The result is a compelling conceptual conflict with limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira will convert her deep understanding into concrete guidance for others—is clear, and there is a credible tightening when the faces pool into one expectant expression and she must choose a course. However, the conflict remains largely interior and contemplative, with little sense of immediate risk if she fails or chooses differently. Her final decision to use the shard as a diagnostic tool for cracked understanding is thematically strong but not framed as a difficult trade-off with visible cost. A more explicit clash between an easier, comforting use of the lighthouse and the harder, more dangerous use implied by the fragment would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how she prepares herself emotionally for a chosen death—is clearly established, and disaster relief provides a crucible for that exploration. There is a meaningful deepening as she moves from seeking “the sound of approaching endings” to understanding endings as a process and reinterpreting her grandmother’s endurance. However, the on-page pressure remains mostly internal and reflective, with little in the way of overt reversals or forced trade-offs in the present-tense scene. The closing decision feels more like the culmination of accrued contemplation than a choice under fresh, acute strain.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains locked in old grief or reaches a livable acceptance—is clear and consistently pressed by the empty station and the burned fragment. Escalation is internal but real: his reflection moves from remembered passion to a reframing of love’s purpose and a micro-choice to stop watching only for departures. The cost of acceptance is legible, though the conflict never quite sharpens into a single high-pressure decision point. For elite venues, a slightly tighter, more acute present-moment pressure would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the boundary-memories and prophetic echoes will be tended—is implied but remains largely abstract, with no direct opposition or tangible risk on the page. Pressure modestly deepens when she’s asked why she persists and must articulate an answer, but that question is off-stage and resolved in reflection rather than in-scene conflict. The prophet’s absence and the future child introduce potential cost, yet they do not force Mira into a new decision or clear trade-off in the closing beat. As a result, tension operates more as low-grade spiritual unease than as escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maren can honor and “hold” the pain of forgotten workers—is clear but remains largely abstract and unopposed. There is no real external pushback, ticking clock, or internal resistance; she proceeds to do exactly what she came to do, at her own pace. The work on the torn photograph does not noticeably escalate in difficulty or cost; it’s a gentle deepening, not a tightening. As a result, pressure remains low and the piece operates more as a lyrical vignette than as a story with strong conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can decode and accept the library’s pattern of growth/end—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. His key “choices” (taking and returning the crystal, adopting silence as testimony) form a gentle escalation rather than a sharp tightening. There’s no strong reversal or moment where a genuine alternative path is vividly on the table. As a result, tension is present but muted, more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—Mira’s need to capture an elusive sound to quiet a persistent, almost painful longing—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively through her drawn-out anticipation and the sense that this compulsion has been tugging at her for weeks. The final “choice” is essentially receptive: she endures and listens rather than deciding between competing harms, so the felt price is subtler than in more confrontational pieces. The internal conflict between her clarity in the present and her inability to hold the future is intriguing but could be tested more directly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will keep trying to “stop time” or accept motion and grief—is signaled clearly and tightened by the seismic tremor and the sense that “something must be restructured before the tremor passes.” The meaningful turn is the decision to aim the camera at the spinning hand and reconceive capture as allowing passage rather than arrest. Conflict is primarily internal, and while the external pressure (the quake) is somewhat symbolic, it does push him toward a crystallized stance. The piece remains meditative rather than sharply pressured, which keeps escalation from feeling truly urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—guiding Margery into a good goodbye while Elara confronts her own impending death—are clear and emotionally credible. However, the conflict is mostly static; once Elara arrives, there is no significant resistance, reversal, or new risk to force a hard choice. The late reveal that she has already called the daughter happens off-stage and doesn’t test her in the moment. As a result, the ending feels moving but not hard-won in terms of on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is intellectual and reputational—solving the noon shadow problem to be “worthy” as a scholar—signaled early but never sharply dramatized as having consequences beyond personal satisfaction. Pressure escalates mildly as she moves from theory to experimental practice with the key, with the sequence of loops functioning as a formal deepening rather than a genuine narrowing of options. There’s no serious chance of failure, harm, or loss; the key responds almost immediately and reliably to her first attempt. The conflict is thus intriguingly conceptual but relatively static, with little tension beyond curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what stance Elara will take toward the ministry’s “resolution” and her own history with the changeling—is clear early. Pressure escalates internally as she rejects the official ending, returns to the charged garden, and chooses to use the tooth, culminating in a shift from seeking closure as an end to accepting a charged, permanent fracture. The cost is accepting that she will never have a clean answer about her child’s nature, only an altered way to carry that uncertainty. The escalation is quiet and accumulative rather than sharply turned, which is effective but keeps tension at a meditative simmer rather than a true peak.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal—how Elira will live with the loss of her wings and relationship to light—and those are signaled early and resolved by the end. However, pressure remains relatively soft; the pearl’s appearance functions as an almost frictionless solution that aligns perfectly with her skill set, and there is little sense of risk, competing values, or meaningful foreclosed options during the key decision to work on it. The escalation feels more like a gentle unfolding than a tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator will live with and respond to the viral confession and the reopened family wound—is clear and emotionally weighty. Pressure deepens via the hospital backstory and the present-moment phone call, culminating in the decision to withhold full truth from the mother while still “staying” in relationship. Escalation is subtle and largely internal; there is no strong reversal or narrowing of external options, which keeps the tension persuasive but relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—fear of failure vs the need to create—remains clear and under steady pressure, and the encounter with her abandoned characters intensifies it. The major tightening is the shift from seeing those unwritten stories as failures to offerings, which credibly forces a new stance. However, the conflict stays largely internal and reflective; there is little sense of traded options or visible loss beyond the emotional reframing. Escalation is present but gentle, fitting the lyric mode yet stopping short of truly sharp stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the moonvine and sacred practices—is articulated but never genuinely threatened in scene. Once Elara arrives, every step proceeds smoothly: no resistance from the environment, the ritual, or her own doubts, so tension remains low and static. Escalation is primarily a matter of descriptive intensification (more light, more threads) rather than narrowing options or increasing cost. As a result, the climax is pretty but not truly suspenseful.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely internal and conceptual—Elara’s desire to create a map of a heartbeat—without being tested by any real opposition or risk. The pressure does not notably escalate; she proceeds through her ritual without interruption, doubt, or trade-off beyond mild physical discomfort. The completion of the pattern is important to her, but the story never makes it feel like failure is a live possibility with consequences. As a result, tension is low and the ending reads as a beautiful completion rather than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is intellectual and conceptual: will Elira merely fix a timer or reconceive and redirect its purpose toward wonder. That tension does deepen as she studies reflections and reinterprets the object, but there’s little external opposition or urgent countervailing force, and no clear moment where a viable alternative path is truly foreclosed on the page. Her choice to commit to a seasons-long repair is more serene acceptance than pressured trade-off. As a result, escalation is present but muted, limiting the sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—her gradual surrender of her body and individuality in exchange for not bearing sorrow alone—is clear but only gently pressured. There is no real on-page contest between staying human and becoming pattern; the text emphasizes her acceptance early, so the later calcification doesn’t escalate stakes so much as extend a foregone conclusion. This produces an effective mood piece but keeps the conflict from feeling actively sharpened or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how she will live with and “contain” her grief—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates texturally via the lion’s gradual emergence and especially the eyes waiting for glass beads, which crystallizes the life-or-not decision her husband taught her. The final recommitment to carving rather than to domestic ritual (cold kettle, forgotten tea) marks a meaningful narrowing of options and acceptance of cost. That said, the conflict remains largely internal and steady-state; there is one deepening rather than a sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can renegotiate her relationship with her former, ambitious self—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly: from collecting anonymous confessions at a distance, to the physical/visual weight of the camera wheel, to the direct confrontation with her ghost and the demand for an answer. The choice to accept exhaustion instead of continuing the argument offers a real, if quiet, cost: she forecloses both self-justification and the fantasy of restoration. The conflict remains largely interior and could use one more concrete external snag or risk, but what’s here is coherent and non-static.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether an abandoned spaceport can be repurposed into a source of communal renewal—is clearly signaled, but it never truly comes under pressure. Mara encounters no on-page resistance from environment, bureaucracy, or community; the technical challenge is asserted and then solved largely in summary. The one qualitative tightening is her shift from mapping to a full proposal, but this doesn’t foreclose options or exact a visible price. As a result, stakes remain more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether to keep the clock frozen as a way of clinging to grief or to wind it and accept loss—is clearly articulated. Pressure does deepen, particularly through the bear’s gentle arrival and the synchronized moment of sunrise + crystal song + key turning. However, the internal conflict is mostly pre-resolved in exposition; by the time we reach the key in his pocket, the outcome feels likely rather than truly contested. Escalation is present but quiet, with limited sense of cost beyond the articulated emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering an erased canal and the truth behind its erasure—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle and largely preparatory. The main deepening is her realization that Konstantýn participated in the obfuscation, which sharpens the intellectual conflict but doesn’t significantly narrow options or enact a visible cost. There is little escalation beyond accumulating evidence and recognition; no real reversal or hard trade-off is forced in this scene. As a result, stakes feel more like promise than active tension.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to decipher the encoded knowledge and grasp what inheritance/preservation truly mean—is clear. There is a mild escalation as fog thickens and he moves from mere observation to actively using the fulgurite to “reveal” the pattern. However, pressure is low: there’s no real deadline, jeopardy, or serious alternative outcome other than “he understands it now” versus “he doesn’t yet.” As a result, the final decision to plant seeds and weave patterns forward feels meaningful but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what it means to be present in a place of departures after missing her own—is clear and interesting, and the final choice to stay does reweight her situation. However, conflict remains primarily conceptual and reflective; there’s limited sense of competing impulses being tested on the page or of genuine risk in either choice. The missed ship is a powerful condition but doesn’t escalate once established; pressure mostly plateaus into contemplation. The piece works as a quiet, internal arc, but the absence of one sharp tightening or visible trade-off undercuts higher-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant conflict—obedience to his father’s kill-switch mission versus his emerging belief in integration—reads clearly and intensifies as he engages with the egg and the Genesis Engine’s history. The pressure deepens primarily through new understanding rather than external obstacles: the egg’s warmth and the revealed instructions shift his options from simple destruction to a morally complex alternative. However, there is little concrete price or immediate threat forcing his choice; the walk back begins without any explicit sacrifice beyond implied risk and disobedience. A small, embodied consequence (delay, danger, or explicit renunciation) would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and historical; in the present scene, there is no adversarial force or time pressure. The dominant stake—how she lives with her father’s legacy—is clear but not escalated through new obstacles or opposition. The ending “choice” to return to the village is aligned with what she has long been doing, so the cost feels conceptual rather than freshly paid. The piece reads more as a character study vignette than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating stolen memories and reconfiguring Mira’s stance toward mystery—is clear, but pressure escalates more in concept than in felt urgency or danger. Following the breadcrumbs and “unsticking” the memories is smooth and largely uncontested, so we don’t see tactics adapt under real resistance or cost. The most meaningful tightening is the realization that someone deliberately left a trail hoping for someone like her, which does deepen her commitment. Overall, it’s a beautifully textured quest with relatively low on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The primary tension—Vael’s ritualized custodianship disrupted by the gear’s unexpected awakening—is intriguing but under-pressured. The gear begins to tick on its own, and Vael “stopped moving” and listens, yet no real alternative or explicit risk is tested on the page. The stakes are almost entirely internal and philosophical, with little escalation beyond an increasingly weighty mood. This yields a beautiful texture but a relatively static conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find a livable understanding of grief and her inherited craft—is clear and present early. Pressure coheres around her self-imposed deadline (the migration) and her confrontation with the ribbon and greenhouse, culminating in the poem recital and vision of grief-as-weather. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than via strong reversals, but the cadence tightens credibly at the reading and butterfly ascent. The conflict remains quiet and could use one more explicit moment of resistance or alternative path to sharpen the cost of her final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Marcus bears his guilt and pursues “incremental absolution”—is clear, and the 37-second pause provides a concrete pressure point. There is a meaningful tightening as the pendulum approaches its apex and he commits to feeling “the full weight of his negligence.” Still, escalation is mostly vertical (deeper reflection) rather than involving new obstacles or options; the piece flirts with stasis, relying on intensity rather than change in circumstance. The cost is emotional and interior but could be made sharper by confronting a new risk or temptation in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual and low-tension: the implicit question is whether the sovereign’s intentions will be understood, but there is no sense of what happens if the gardener fails or refuses. The decoding proceeds smoothly without obstacles, moral friction, or meaningful trade-offs. There is one soft tightening—realizing the tapestry encodes a plea about hidden mercy—but it doesn’t force a difficult decision. The piece works as a meditative scene rather than a story with escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she dares to inscribe possible futures responsibly—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does grow slightly as the feather becomes “weighty” and her mentor’s injunction looms, but there is no genuine reversal or narrowed option set. Her eventual choice to start writing doesn’t feel like it forecloses a competing live path on the page. The result is thoughtful, but tension stays low and steady rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are inherently high (illegal broadcasting under patrol surveillance, cultural extinction after a “story famine”), but on the page they remain largely hypothetical. There is no concrete escalation—no patrol passing close, no broadcast gone awry, no immediate test of her methods. Tension is more conceptual than visceral; she prepares and sings, but nothing pushes back in real time. As a result, conflict feels underdeveloped relative to the richness of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal—how to honor someone fundamentally unknowable—and the stakes are emotional but clear. Pressure escalates via the irreversible act of breaking heirlooms (off-page but felt), then burning the portrait, then committing the ash to the mask, each step foreclosing the option of conventional preservation. The piece stays quiet rather than sharply testing her resolve; Mira never seriously considers *not* doing the ritual, which keeps tension more meditative than fraught. Still, the choice to accept elusive truth as enough, rather than continuing to chase certainty, lands as an earned, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept comforting official myths or commit to slow, costly truth-seeking—is clear, but conflict remains largely internal and philosophical. Pressure does deepen as the narrator articulates the moral implications of their findings (complicity of elites, failure of engineers), yet these realizations don’t materially narrow their options in the present scene. The “agonizing” over evidence is more asserted than dramatized through specific dilemmas or sacrifices beyond social isolation. The final stance crystallization (“I work anyway… Someone will find these artifacts someday”) is convincing but lands as a continuation rather than a sharpened, newly-costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Eleanor can counter the “vanishing” of both music and her own hatred by reaching this student—are clear but remain mostly internal and low-key. There is a modest escalation as the student’s posture and breathing change, showing her method taking hold. However, there’s no true hinge where she risks a different tactic, or where failure feels momentarily live; the scene proceeds almost entirely on expected rails. The result is textured but gently static tension rather than a fully pressurized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether suppressed, embodied knowledge will survive in a form Elena controls—is clear and coherent, and the choice to ingest the seed and reclaim the greenhouse is a meaningful stance. However, external and internal pressure remain relatively soft: no one opposes her in the moment, the seed poses no palpable danger, and her decision to reject institutional control seems largely settled before the scene. Escalation is primarily accumulative and tonal (the alignment peaks, memories flood in) rather than driven by increasingly costly options. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not sharply tested; her values aren’t truly risked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city’s light and purpose—is large in concept but experienced mostly at an abstract remove. Conflict is minimal: once the box appears, opposition is essentially internal skepticism (“They won’t believe me”) rather than any concrete barrier. The escalation from booth to tower to reading the riddle is a smooth incline, but nothing meaningfully resists Elara or Mira, and no option is truly foreclosed. As a result, the resolution lands more as gentle revelation than as a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—to understand why some houses feel alive—is clear, but opposition and pressure remain very low; nothing resists her inquiry beyond ambient mystery. Escalation occurs as a gradual deepening of awareness (especially once the shard grows warm), but no concrete option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The final realization reweights her experience rather than resolving a fraught dilemma, which suits the mode but keeps tension modest. As a result, the piece reads more as a lyric exploration than as a scene under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Thalassor persists in rigid guardianship or embraces a more uncertain, witnessing stance. Pressure escalates through the ampoule’s memories and crystallizes when the diver arrives, forcing a concrete behavioral test of his new philosophy. The conflict is largely ethical and contemplative rather than peril-driven, which suits the piece but keeps the tension relatively low-key. The visible cost—abandoning a millennia-old identity and acknowledging past cruelty—is clear but mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of her confinement—is clear and the pressure does deepen when the chipped die highlights a dismissed formula, forcing her to reconsider her whole approach. However, tension is largely intellectual and smooth; we don’t see real risk that her conclusion might fail or carry a painful trade-off beyond abstraction. Escalation is present but gentle, lacking a felt test of her resolve or a concrete loss as she embraces the new interpretation. The final choice to “ascend not to escape but to understand” reads more as a philosophical shift than a pressured decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether kindness vanishes or endures in hidden forms—is clear but operates almost entirely internally. Escalation is gentle: the “something different” about this night and the intensified daydreams mark a deepening, yet Mira faces little articulated resistance or risk in accepting the revelation. Her agency matters most when she allows her hand to move, interprets what she sees, and chooses to leave the paintings, but these choices encounter minimal friction. As a result, the tension is more contemplative than pressurized, limiting the felt cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—whether they keep their arts hidden or risk exposure—is clearly articulated, and the thaw provides a real shift in risk. However, conflict remains mostly atmospheric: the regime and its agents are entirely off-stage, and no concrete test or irreversible move besides Maren’s symbolic advance occurs. The tension between safety in darkness and perilous emergence is thematically strong but could use one sharper, on-page tightening or loss to fully earn higher-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Iris can and will defy her destined death at the risk of obliteration—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates conceptually from omen (hunger stone) to technical breakthrough (click into place) to existential payoff (reality unwinding). However, conflict is largely internal and declarative; we’re told of danger and cost more than we see her wrestle with alternatives or near-failure. One concrete setback or moment of hesitation before activation would sharpen escalation and make the price feel more contested.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will succumb to the curse/terror and retreat from life or move through fear—is signaled early and tightened as the mirrors multiply her dread, the photo reveals corruption, and the advisor urges retreat. The meaningful tightening occurs at the last mirror, where her reflection wears the cloak and the clasp’s repulsive allure crystallizes the desire/terror fusion that she must name. Her choice to confess her suicidal intent and walk back out, leaving the dictionary behind, resolves the conflict with visible emotional cost. The conflict remains primarily internal and conceptual, with relatively little external obstruction, which keeps it just under the strongest band for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake is essentially conceptual—whether the sea’s “obstacles” can be translated into music—rather than a concrete threat or dilemma. Pressure does modestly tighten when the larger wave arrives, creating a subtle test of timing and control, but there’s no real risk of failure or meaningful loss. Her choices never foreclose an option or impose a felt price; everything she attempts works and deepens the harmony. As a result, tension remains low and the piece reads as demonstration rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—daring to probe the forbidden mystery of the watchers and the lost expedition—is signaled clearly via Council prohibitions and the Priestesses’ warnings. Pressure escalates when Mira chooses to blow the whistle despite these strictures, turning quiet observation into a risky act that draws an immediate, uncanny response. However, the stakes stay mostly abstract and atmospheric; we’re told approach invites destruction, but no concrete price or narrowed option hits the page yet. The piece functions more as a powerful inciting episode than a fully tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—whether to preserve a noble lie or reveal an inconvenient truth—is clear and thematically rich, but it doesn’t escalate much across the passage. We are told the question has kept her awake for months, yet on the page it feels like a pre-processed dilemma rather than a live, tightening struggle. The arrival of the letter and her presence at the station nominally raise the stakes, but there’s little sense of a new, on-scene complication or cost forcing her hand. Her final decision is weighty in implication, but the immediate dramatic pressure is relatively low-key and static.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Maren’s need to transform her relationship to her work and to claim a new role—are legible and tied to the concrete task of exploring the pavilion before the tide returns. The rising water provides a gentle but coherent escalation, forcing her to stop exploring, perch on the highest bench, and eventually withdraw. Still, the conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative; there’s little on-page risk to her safety, career, or relationships beyond what’s stated. The final choice to take the inkwell and redefine her work lands, but its cost and irreversibility feel muted rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is the preservation and recognition of suppressed truth, and it does sharpen as Mira moves from passive cataloging to active complicity with the hidden archive. The main “tightening” is cognitive—realizing the marginalia are deliberate testimony and that her inherited tools tie her to that lineage—rather than any external threat. As a result, pressure remains low-intensity and largely internal; there’s little sense of concrete risk or an option she might realistically refuse. It works for a quiet literary piece, but escalation and cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how Mira lives with her daughter’s loss—is clear and present early, and the craft process provides a steady, low-key tension. We get one real deepening when her failed ascension attempt is revealed and shown to have reoriented her practice away from outward searching and toward inward containment. However, pressure does not markedly tighten over the course of the scene: the conflict remains largely static, and the final beat reaffirms an existing pattern instead of forcing a new trade-off. The cost is emotionally legible but not escalated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary conflict is existential: how to live with arbitrary survival and the sense that his life is part of a cosmic calculation, not a moral narrative. Stakes are clear—what to do with his “unused potential”—and the story tightens as he rejects conventional survivor coping mechanisms in favor of his solitary mathematical “hunt.” The escalation is conceptual rather than situational, culminating in the bleak commitment to a never-ending search that he knows will not yield answers. Because there is no discrete on-page test or reversal beyond deepening realization, the pressure feels strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will Mira find or decode a form of belonging—is clear early and does deepen as she recognizes the observatory’s true purpose. The main escalation is her choice to pull the lever as the stars align, which narrows her options and commits her to whatever the machine will do. Yet the conflict stays mostly internal and low-friction; the machine offers no real resistance or danger, and her handlers’ expectations exert no on-page pressure. As a result, there’s more revelation than struggle, and the cost of her new stance is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will continue to suppress or finally confront the truth about her father’s death—is clear and threads the whole piece. Escalation comes via the movement from generalized guilt about clients to the personal horror of her mother’s commissioned memory rewrite, culminating in the watch-hand trigger. That said, pressure remains primarily internal and somewhat pre-decided (she has already chosen to come here), so the sense of narrowing options or forced trade-off is muted. The ending reads as a single, solid deepening rather than a truly testing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to continue an inherited cycle of ritualized enmity—is legible from early on and resolves through his renunciation of the heirloom and the old ritual. Pressure remains coherent and grows primarily in an internal, ethical register, with the presence of the adversary’s granddaughter serving as a live test of his resolve. However, escalation is relatively gentle because his decision has been substantially pre-made off-page; the scene confirms and enacts it rather than forcing a fresh, harrowing trade-off under sudden strain. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than plot-dangerous, but it lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reclaim a viable way of being on the water after disability and withdrawal—is legible and present from the outset. Pressure tightens through the choppy water and the moment the current pulls her seaward, forcing her to reassert agency by correcting back toward the poles. The cost is primarily internal (risk of confirming she’s “broken,” and the pain of confronting lost identity) rather than physical, which keeps the escalation quiet. The conflict never quite feels truly hazardous, but for a lyric piece the progression is credible and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera can meaningfully reconstitute a self and empathy post-reset—is present throughout, and the trip into the cavern is framed as a test of that. Conflict, however, remains largely internal and low-friction; she encounters no real resistance or dilemma on the way to the traveler, so escalation reads as deepening mood rather than narrowing options. The one tightening is the moment at the lake when she confronts the traveler and realizes she can feel their voice, but this comes almost as a gentle reveal rather than something she had to fight toward. The cost is conceptual (accepting that growth must start now, without the old guilt), but not strongly dramatized through competing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Lysara accepts the metamorphosis and role as bridge to the dead—is stated early and followed consistently. Pressure does deepen somewhat as the spices draw Korin closer and her human self “unravels,” but the conflict doesn’t truly tighten; she arrives already “afraid, and ready,” and there is no real reversal or moment where she might pull back. The resolution is more confirmation than test, so the felt cost of choosing this path remains soft. The story reads as a beautifully rendered acceptance rather than a contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—her need to undo or balance the choice of magic over motherhood—is clearly signaled and maintained. Pressure escalates as the saucer reveals visualized regrets, culminating in the risky, painful act of cutting her palm, which forces a real commitment to confrontation. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual; external consequences are static, keeping tension more meditative than gripping. Still, her shift from seeking reclamation of time to accepting that release, not recovery, is the only path is a meaningful tightening of the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Seraph can transform accumulated grief and “shadow” into a bridge to the locked dimension—is coherent but largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does increase somewhat as she commits to defacing the photographs and persists “through the night that was not night,” yet there’s little sense of risk if she fails or stops. The escalation is therefore gentle rather than sharp, without a strong moment where an option is clearly foreclosed or a trade-off bites. The ending choice to step through reads as inevitable more than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to understand transformation—remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal on-page opposition. There is one genuine tightening as the eclipse peaks and the fireflies’ message becomes legible, reweighting her journey. However, she never faces a concrete, pressured trade-off or a hard renunciation; the “price” of not keeping beauty is stated rather than fought over. Escalation is therefore more about increasing symbolic density than about narrowing her options under visible strain.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes—uncovering a clandestine revolutionary network under a repressive regime—are inherently high, but on the page they remain mostly conceptual. Elara encounters little resistance: no guard interference, time pressure, or visible penalty for stepping away from her post, and her big choice to transmit feels more like an inevitable step than a hard-won decision. The blackout is a useful pretext but doesn’t escalate into concrete obstacles or narrowed options beyond allowing privacy. Conflict is present and coherent but lacks a sharp on-page test or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling the promise by truly understanding the eels/patterns—is clear early, and escalation is centered on her decision to risk all remaining collapsed star dust on a single, untested sequence. The internal and external conflicts (curse of passive foresight vs desire to effect change, catching vs connecting) interweave conceptually, and the final stance shift is earned. However, the scene lacks a strong on-page reversal or complication: once she chooses the Spiral, events unfold smoothly with little sense that failure is a live, dangerous option, which mutes tension and the felt cost of success. As a result, stakes remain more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain self-silenced or re-engage her voice—is clear and threads the piece. Escalation follows the accumulative lens: the storm’s arrival, opening the envelope, then speaking the forbidden verses all progressively narrow her psychological options until she acknowledges she has been sustaining the pause. Her final stance (moving toward the storm, writing on the glass) reads as an earned renunciation of passivity. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no sharp reversal or concrete external pressure testing her resolve, so the sense of price and jeopardy is more lyrical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—over a proof that encodes a deeper disagreement about truth—is clearly stated and mapped onto the physical fencing, with a visible escalation in intensity. The meaningful turn comes when Varn “sees an opening” in philosophy rather than defense and redirects the younger scholar’s momentum into recognition. Stakes, however, stay largely abstract (intellectual posture, philosophical method) with limited on-page cost or narrowed options beyond wounded certainty. The resolution feels earned but not sharply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—whether these two women can risk sharing their hidden selves and co-create meaning in an obliterating institution—are clear and appropriate to the quiet mode. Escalation is present as an emotional deepening: from silent work, to philosophical exchange, to confessions, to literal inscription in books. Yet the pressure never quite tightens into a true squeeze; Mira’s decision to open the coffee tin and share a private poem arrives smoothly rather than against a sharply dramatized fear or counterforce. The felt price is there but understated, keeping the conflict in a reflective rather than urgent register.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can create a belated, defiant “encore” for Clara and himself—is clear, but on-page opposition is almost entirely internal and largely decided before the story begins. Once the compasses flicker, there is no real friction or jeopardy to reaching the arbor; the method is already mastered, so his path is smooth. The main tightening is temporal (this particular convergence at dusk), yet there’s little sense he might miss it or pay a new price for taking it. As a result, the piece reads more as a beautifully staged ritual than a conflict that escalates toward a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering collective memory before the monsoon and the complete “forgetting”—is signaled early and remains coherent to the end. The primary tightening is internal: the ritual encounter forces Mira to relinquish her reliance on verification and accept a new stance toward knowledge and memory. Externally, however, pressure is relatively smooth: the journey is unimpeded, the ritual faces no visible resistance, and the monsoon clock never quite bites into on-page choices. The result is an elegant but low-friction escalation, more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marek can reconfigure his relationship to Elias’s departure and his own regret—is clear and steadily pressured by the compass and lace. Escalation is subtle but present: months of study, realization that the pattern changes, then the compass aligning with a particular thread and finally his chest, each deepening the emotional tension. The decisive “choice” is an internal renunciation/shift toward forgiveness, mirrored by returning to the pine with a new intention. The piece remains very quiet, so while the cost is felt, the conflict never quite sharpens into a hard dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is entirely internal and abstract (categorization vs. reality), lacking immediate external pressure or consequence. The stakes—changing one's mind about cosmic metaphors—feel low, and the epiphany arrives without significant resistance or the foreclosure of a tangible alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal conflict (fear vs. understanding) is handled well and resolves clearly. The external stakes are high but distant; the antagonist pressure is a memory rather than an immediate force, making the tension largely contemplative until the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (rectifying the loss of sound) is abstract, and the escalation is internal and relatively low-pressure. The "erratic readings" in the hall promise a complication, but the tension dissolves immediately into a "current of hope" rather than forcing a tactical shift or a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Aldric enters the realm, intuits the rules instantly, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or cost. The stakes are declared (souls needing help) but never tested by a specific obstacle or the possibility of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are established in the premise (sanctions, guards patrolling below), but the climax ignores the threat; the bell rings audibly in view of the guards, yet there is no reaction, lowering the tension to zero. The conflict feels theoretical rather than operational; the "risk" of resistance is stated but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is virtually absent, as there is no antagonist, time limit, or risk of failure to test the protagonist's goal. The narrative progresses smoothly from identification to resolution without any meaningful escalation or threat to the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure accumulates effectively via the disintegration motif and the ticking clock of fading memory. The stakes are high, but the cost remains largely conceptual ("carry like a stone") rather than an immediate, visceral price paid on the page, partly due to the story's brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    Immediate stakes are low; the antagonist (soldiers) is hypothetical and the obstacle (the lock) is already solved. The lack of an active, resisting force on the page turns the scene into a routine errand rather than a high-stakes mission; everything proceeds exactly according to plan.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes of memory loss and the 10-year biological clock provide background urgency, the immediate scene lacks active resistance or external pressure. The conflict is largely intellectual and retrospective, resolved by a realization that feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain low throughout; the success of the portrait feels inevitable, and the opposing pressure (fading light) is gentle. The conflict is primarily thematic rather than dramatic, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract ("capacity for wonder"), facing no resistance or risk of failure in the scene. The "un Freezing" is presented as an inevitable process rather than a struggle won through agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.7)
    The conflict is static: Daniel advances while Maya reads a prop. There is no back-and-forth struggle or escalation of tactics; the antagonist waits for the protagonist to finish her epiphany. The resolution comes from acquiring information, not from a test of will or ingenuity that forces a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is largely external and ambient; the storm rages, but it does not force the oracle to alter her method or sacrifice anything tangible. The escalation is linear (the star fades, she finishes) lacking a moment of high pressure where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are purely philosophical and lack urgency or external pressure. While the internal inquiry is clear, the absence of an obstacle or potential loss makes the "escalation" feel like a gentle drift rather than a mounting conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Mira offers trust, and the protagonist reciprocates immediately without doubt or external opposition. The "ticket I had been saving" attempts to introduce cost, but since it is used exactly as intended for a desired outcome, the transaction lacks the friction or sacrifice required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    Immediate stakes are very low; the investor conflict is resolved backstory, and the villager's arrival offers only mild, late-breaking pressure. The story lacks a tightening of options in the present moment, as Elara’s dominance over her environment is never truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.3)
    Tension is low; the countdown ("seventeen minutes") provides a clock but no actual opposition or complication. The protagonist faces no risk of failure, and the resolution requires no sacrifice, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    The flood functions as scenery rather than an antagonist; Elena navigates it without genuine peril or cost. The stakes remain low because the central discovery—the "evidence"—imposes no difficult choice or sacrifice on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear—personal paralysis versus professional duty during a crisis—and the pressure escalates appropriately with the approaching storm. While the internal stakes are high, the external "terror" feels slightly muted by the swiftness of the resolution; the cost of the error is felt, but the current struggle resolves a bit too smoothly once the epiphany hits.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (maintaining rationality vs. surrendering to the ghost shift) is present but low-pressure. The protagonist's surrender feels inevitable due to the "drowsy" atmospheric influence rather than a hard-won decision with visible costs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=2.1)
    There is no dominant stake, opposition, or escalation; the narrative describes a therapeutic process without risk or obstacle. The absence of pressure renders the piece static, lacking the tension required for narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric rather than antagonistic; there is little on-page resistance from the children or the environment to force a hard choice. The "conflict" (isolation vs. connection) resolves smoothly with the eclipse's progression, missing the opportunity for a moment of doubt or tactical failure that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is internal and intellectual, lacking immediate on-page jeopardy or hard tactical trade-offs. The pressure stems from the weight of the realization rather than an active antagonist or ticking clock, which limits narrative tension. While the global stakes are high, the scene itself feels safe and low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The external pressure arrives late via the letter, but it successfully forces a decisive stance (refusal) that clarifies the stakes between duty and autonomy. While the choice is clear, the cost of refusing an official intelligence recall feels somewhat light on the page, lacking a sense of imminent danger.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension accumulates successfully through the layering of sound and the looming deadline of midnight. However, the conflict remains largely theoretical and internal; the antagonist reacts with a scream, but does not force a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot on the page beyond the decision to enter.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes (mental fragmentation, the council's demand) are stated clearly but remain largely theoretical until the end. The pressure of the approaching dawn acts as a timer, but there are few on-page obstacles that Elira must actively overcome. The conflict feels low-friction; she is asked to perform a task, and she performs it with grace rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is internal but abstract; the stakes ("never be whole") are stated rather than felt through immediate danger or loss. The obstacle—darkening brightness—is navigated without a shift in tactic or a moment of genuine doubt, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.7)
    The conflict is internal but resolved with relatively low resistance; the solution (backward music) is provided by a mentor figure rather than earned through the protagonist's sacrifice or ingenuity. The lack of a visible price or distinct trade-off for her transformation limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from personal safety to public truth. The pressure of the "watchers" is felt, though the antagonist remains somewhat abstract. The final choice represents a clear foreclosure of her safety in exchange for integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is low; the conflict is entirely internal and resolves smoothly without a moment of doubt or risk of failure. The obstacle—fear of the scent—is overcome easily, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are distinct but largely abstract, centered on a philosophical choice between documentation and transformation. The glowing rope provides a necessary external signal of escalation, but the pressure remains low-key and cerebral until the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict between the musician and the "chronic hush" is coherent and fits the genre, but the stakes remain abstract. The escalation is linear (playing notes -> playing a song -> bowl vibrating) without a distinct reversal or a moment where the silence actively threatens to overwhelm her agency, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is low throughout, as the protagonist remains in complete control of the experiment and its outcome without external opposition. The stakes remain philosophical; the success of the compound creates no new complication, trade-off, or tangible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    External opposition is virtually nonexistent, and the internal hesitation (broker instincts vs. compassion) is overcome without significant cost or struggle. The story operates on a gentle accumulative pressure that lacks the tension or deepening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear (belonging vs. isolation), but the on-page pressure is low. The protagonist faces no external resistance in the scene; the resolution comes from looking at a reflection and deciding to change. The cost is understood intellectually but not paid dramatically on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is strictly environmental and abstract, lacking an antagonist or escalating stakes. The protagonist faces no significant opposition; she simply applies a known solution to a problem, missing the requisite tightening of options or deepening of peril.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Conflict is largely internal and abstract, lacking immediate external urgency until the moon sets. While the "tightening" works on a conceptual level, the stakes feel somewhat theoretical until the physical offering is made.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are negligible as Maren faces no active opposition, and the "unusual freedom" of the outage removes environmental pressure. The story lacks a moment where a meaningful value is traded for another; the resolution comes without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clearly established and escalated by the irony of the grant arriving alongside the medical decline. The conflict between professional mastery and personal loss creates coherent pressure. The resolution forces a trade-off—surrendering control to gain connection—that carries a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (sanity/sleep) are clear, and the cost (the grandmother's brooch) is paid on the page. However, the conflict is low-friction; the stranger is immediately cooperative, and the negotiation is essentially a mutual agreement without testing the protagonist’s resolve or adaptability. The exchange feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are internal (certainty vs. presence) but clearly drawn. The pressure mounts effectively when the pearls refuse to function as expected. While the conflict is resolved somewhat internally through realization rather than external consequence, the shift in worldview is earned by the environment's resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are thematic rather than urgent; the resolution arrives through a low-pressure epiphany without active opposition, difficult trade-offs, or immediate on-page cost. Everything goes according to plan, leaving the protagonist untested.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared ("terrified of becoming lost") but never tested; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or genuine risk of failure. The resolution is earned not through struggle or sacrifice, but by following a guided path to a tool that works perfectly on the first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal; there is no external pressure or time constraint forcing the protagonist's hand, reducing the sense of urgency. The conflict is resolved through surrender to the magic rather than a high-stakes decision that forecloses other options.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is driven by external weather (the storm intensity) rather than protagonist decisions, resulting in low tension. The stakes are theoretical (existence vs. transition) rather than viscerally felt, as the character achieves his desire without facing resistance or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    The external antagonist—a system "designed to say no"—is established as formidable but yields to a single draft of an honest application, making the victory feel naive. There is no visible on-page cost or friction during the execution of the solution; the obstacle liquefies too easily to generate high-band narrative pressure. The stakes are stated high but played low.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "change" in the frequency acts as a curiosity rather than a source of pressure or threat. There are no competing stakes or urgent trade-offs; Elara's isolation is treated as a philosophical advantage rather than a source of friction, resulting in a lack of narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal without a visible pressure test; the protagonist faces no active opposition or forced trade-off on the page. The climax is a passive reception of information rather than a decisive action with a felt, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict dissolves too easily; Elena surrenders her lifelong worldview without significant on-page struggle or cost. The stakes remain abstract, and the "demystification" process meets no real resistance before the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    Opposition is passive and ambient (investors walking nearby), lacking a direct antagonist or immediate obstacle to the protagonist's actions. The pressure is atmospheric rather than causal, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the protagonist faces no real risk of failure or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is entirely environmental (time pressure), lacking interpersonal or deep internal friction to ratchet up stakes. The loss of the frost is a "melancholy truth" accepted in advance, meaning the pressure does not force a new stance or costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the deadline (dawn) creates a clock but generates no genuine obstacles, setbacks, or tactical pivots. The protagonist succeeds effortlessly in a "process procedural" with no escalation of stakes or price paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and high for the character's career, but the on-page pressure is quiet and intellectual rather than urgent or antagonistic. The escalation relies on observation and interpretation rather than active confrontation or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is primarily man-versus-entropy, which works for the tone but lacks sharp active pressure or a dynamic antagonist. The escalation is well-handled through the physical toll (aching legs, warming fork), though the stakes feel somewhat theoretical until the stones respond.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The physical stakes (drowning) are high but are resolved somewhat too easily by the magic system, which instantly removes the immediate danger. The mechanical obstacle ("gears that had rusted shut") yields to a mere touch without sufficient dramatized effort, reducing the tactile pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes (truth vs. forgetting) are established early and escalate as Marcus breaches the chamber. The pressure is well-managed, with the "bodies not yet found" providing a ticking clock that charges his actions. The ending achieves a Charged Poise, crystallizing his stance against the village's denial with a clear, felt cost of incarceration.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and high: eternal entrapment versus a burdened release. The cost is palpable—the gardener inherits a "curse" along with the gift—and the escalation to the moment of physical contact is well-paced.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; the environment "accepted her gifts" and "whispered where to step," removing all opposition. There is no escalation of pressure, no antagonist (internal or external), and no moment where the outcome is in doubt, resulting in a frictionless reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist progresses linearly from finding to cleaning to restoring without facing opposition, mistakes, or hard choices. The stakes remain theoretical, and the restoration feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is largely retrospective and internal; there is no immediate on-page obstacle or antagonist resisting Maren's task. The stakes, while conceptually high for Eleanor, feel low-pressure in the scene, as the only barrier is Maren's own sense of poetic perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is entirely off-stage and abstract ("the coup was coming"), creating a "waiting room" dynamic with zero immediate pressure. The "electric tension" is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through urgent, constrained choices or a visible antagonist. Without a present threat to force her hand, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is dampened by a "welcoming" environment where spirits "demanded nothing," removing external pressure. The primary obstacle is internal, but it dissolves quickly when the magic object activates, lacking a moment of high-stakes resistance or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes of recovering the child's story are clear and emotionally resonant, providing a sufficient "deepening" for this length. However, the conflict is low-resistance; the decoding process proceeds smoothly without external obstacles or significant risk of failure, keeping the pressure relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal and theoretical until the climax. The conflict (burnout vs. joy) faces little active opposition; the fog is a condition rather than an antagonist, and the resolution comes too easily through the successful operation of the equipment, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or tactical escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Conflict is internal and low-pressure; while the shift in perspective is earned, the "cost" (surrendering certainty) feels gentle. The story lacks urgent tightening or a moment where the protagonist faces a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (planting the seed) is established early, but the escalation is mild. The drone serves as a functional obstacle, yet Maren overcomes it with a simple charm offensive that costs her nothing. The lack of a "tightening" moment where she must sacrifice something limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is described summarily ("weight of waiting") rather than escalated through distinct, on-page reversals. The climax relies on a coincidence (the trembling postcard) to trigger an intensification of habit, lacking protagonist agency or a test of the "unstoppable" trait against a new obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the caretaker encounters no obstacles, internal opposition, or external threats to her work. There is no escalation of stakes or pressure, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory that relies entirely on atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared ("shatter years of trust") but never viscerally tested; the protagonist overcomes the obstacle on the first attempt without setbacks. The conflict is primarily internal anxiety which resolves smoothly, lacking a moment where the "reckless" approach forces a hard choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are intellectualized rather than felt; the conflict is resolved instantly by the convenient interpretation of the adhesive, bypassing genuine struggle. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult choice to reach the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks significant escalation or immediate pressure; the stakes are purely internal and processed through summary ("weeks of autumn") rather than a tightening vice of options. The conflict is resolved through steady effort rather than a decisive moment of risk or sacrifice, resulting in a gentle but low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("curiosity became violation") rather than visceral. The climax lacks a true obstacle or cost; the protagonist simply steps off the platform upon arrival, facing no forced trade-off or risk of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical; while the facility is dying, Marek faces no active opposition or dilemma that requires a costly decision. The resolution comes from waiting and observing rather than a protagonist-driven escalation. The cost of "belonging" is not felt or paid on the page; he simply receives the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are legible, but the escalation is internal and relatively low-pressure; the obstacle of the "gap" is resolved by willpower ("reached deeper") rather than a costly choice or tactical shift. The father's presence provides emotional weight but limited dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are virtually nonexistent; Marek plans a trick, executes it perfectly, and succeeds without any distinct obstacle or risk of failure. The opposition is purely theoretical (chaos/tide) rather than a concrete pressure that narrows his options on the page. Without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt, the "orchestrated serendipity" feels like a lecture rather than a drama.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely absent from the present moment; the ban is a distant concept, and the magic works perfectly on the first try. Without resistance from the medium, the environment, or the antagonist, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.2)
    Dominant stakes are virtually nonexistent; there is no obstacle to the protagonist's desires and no risk of failure. The transition to the workday is a chronological inevitability rather than a result of agency, struggle, or tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.5)
    Immediate scene stakes are low; the conflict is entirely retrospective, resolved years ago, and merely commemorated here. There is no active obstacle or escalation in the present moment to force a new choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes remain purely abstract ("revitalization of hope," "human potential") with no immediate, visible cost to Elara on the page. Because she views failure and success as "equally valid" data points, there is no tension or risk to drive the narrative forward. The lack of a specific, time-bound problem precludes any meaningful escalation or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; there is no active opposition, time pressure, or significant cost to the protagonist's success. The conflict is purely situational (deciphering the text) and lacks a moment of genuine risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no active opposition or escalation; the "hush before bells" acts as a mild timer but generates no genuine suspense or tactical difficulty. The stakes remain abstract ("planting seeds of possibility") and are never tested by failure or the threat of loss, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high (war/peace), but the on-page conflict lacks escalation; the antagonists arrive ready to listen and crumble immediately upon hearing Maren’s speech. There is no active counter-move from the warlords that forces Maren to improvise or pay a higher price than she planned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely retrospective, relying on the backstory of the manufactured drought rather than present-moment friction. The approaching thunder serves as a timing marker rather than an antagonist, resulting in a scene with high conceptual stakes but low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is abstract ("Man vs. Society") and lacks immediate urgency, as the "lullaby of conformity" is a passive concept rather than an active antagonist. There is no escalation of risk; the protagonist is never in danger of discovery or failure, resulting in zero tension.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; the "uncommonly serene" attribute deflates immediate tension, leaving the protagonist to wrestle only with a theoretical concept rather than a resistant antagonist or urgent threat. The argument is in the past, and the ritual proceeds without significant obstacle or cost, resulting in a low-pressure narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly established (the last monarch) and the pressure escalates coherently when the wind destroys the prepared structure. The decision to rebuild using the moth wing as a template provides a meaningful tightening of tactics. The cost is well-integrated: the loss of the "carefully constructed" permanent plan in exchange for a fragile, improvised success.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and quiet; while the accumulation of the task provides some momentum, the external pressure is low. The stakes are meaningful to the character but lack immediate, high-risk urgency on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are established via the storm and the decaying ink, but the narrative lacks genuine opposition; the protagonist performs the required actions without obstacle, error, or sacrifice. The tension evaporates instantly upon the ritual's completion, resulting in a linear progression with no escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes of the city's safety are high, the immediate dramatic pressure is low; Maruk faces no active antagonism, only the passive passage of time. The climax is a ritual enactment that proceeds without complication or the risk of failure, resulting in a flat tension curve.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    The conflict is resolved through a lecture rather than a hard trade-off or sacrifice; while the backdrop stakes are high (reality collapsing), the personal stakes dissolve too easily without a lasting price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no antagonist, no consequences for failure, and no moment where the outcome is in doubt. The protagonist creates the object with "patience," which is a trait, not a dramatic price or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear, but the external pressure is low; the repair is completed through a time-jump rather than a high-pressure beat. The cost is largely retrospective (memories) rather than a tangible price paid in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; while "forbidden knowledge" is mentioned, the danger is never dramatized, leaving the protagonist to proceed without genuine resistance. The escalation is linear and lacks a pivotal moment where Mira must risk something significant to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    The conflict is well-defined intellectually—repairing the disruption caused by the time traveler—but lacks immediate physical or emotional urgency. The "ripples" of disruption are observed rather than felt as a direct threat to the protagonist, keeping the stakes theoretical until the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal and atmospheric; while the desire to find the garden is clear, the external pressure is low, and the obstacle is the passive fog rather than an active antagonist or hard constraint. The tightening occurs, but it feels like a natural progression rather than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, time limit, or physical danger to oppose the protagonist's goal. The stakes are purely intellectual, and because the solution works immediately on the first try, there is no escalation of pressure or necessary trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.3)
    The pressure is ambient and environmental rather than acute; the energy beings are a constant backdrop but do not actively oppose Mira's specific actions in the scene. The stakes are high (survival), but the on-page escalation is limited to a competence check rather than a forced dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is minimal; the only physical obstacle (debris) is easily cleared, and the internal obstacle is resolved instantly by the protagonist's gift. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and the stakes, while stated as high (rekindling connection), lack immediate, felt pressure on the page. The narrative glides to its conclusion without testing the protagonist's commitment through genuine adversity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding the nature of memory) is intellectual and abstract, lacking visceral pressure or external opposition. While the storm provides sensory escalation, the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or forced trade-offs. The narrative relies on observation rather than active engagement with risk.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the atmospheric pressure is palpable, active opposition is minimal; there is no wind to fight, no guard to evade, and no risk of the chemicals failing. The stakes remain largely theoretical ("hope itself"), and because the ritual succeeds without a hitch, the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is retrospective and low-pressure; the "difficult conversation" is summarized and placed off-stage, leaving the story to inhabit a low-stakes cool-down period where no active escalation occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are internal and philosophical, lacking visceral tension despite the ticking clock. The conflict resolves through a meditative realization rather than a difficult choice or active trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is present—the glass turns violet, necessitating action—but the stakes remain low and the pressure mild. The conflict is entirely external and managed with ease, lacking the "meaningful tightening" that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or significant setbacks beyond a mild time constraint. The "surrender" at the climax is a transaction performed without visible difficulty or temptation to refuse.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are conceptually clear (suffocation vs. connection) but lack visceral tension; the conflict is resolved through a static realization rather than active struggle. The antagonist is an abstract "encroachment" and a symbolic mirror image, which lowers the immediate sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; Maya faces no significant opposition or difficult choices once she leaves her car. The climax is a spectacle she witnesses rather than a result of her agency, and the resolution comes without a visible or felt price. The stakes are declared (sanity/trust) but never truly threatened in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes regarding the estate and family history are established, and pressure escalates appropriately through the discovery of the machine. However, the abrupt cutoff eliminates the climax and resolution, leaving the conflict unaddressed and the price of the revelation unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and lack escalation; there is no opposition or risk that the magic might fail or exact a toll. The narrative proceeds linearly from discovery to resolution without a tightening of options or a moment of genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is no narrative pressure or risk; the stakes are purely retrospective and thematic, with no moment where the protagonist faces a genuine trade-off or obstacle that tests her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are high in theory (survival, history), but on-page friction is low. Mira faces little direct opposition; the security teams are distant, and the lock opens easily. The climax feels like a task completion rather than a high-stakes struggle, lacking a moment where failure felt genuinely possible.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high (reality unraveling) but remain abstract until the climax, where the letters physically form. The escalation is functional, yet the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won; the cost is paid in stamina but does not force a difficult trade-off or permanent loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared (drought) but remain abstract and future-tense; there is no immediate antagonist or obstacle in the scene to test Seraphina’s agency. The "Hush" provides atmospheric pressure but does not force a difficult trade-off; the resolution comes too easily to generate genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=2.0)
    Stakes (the lost brother and compass) are declared in exposition but never tested in the present action. There is no escalation, reversal, or deepening of pressure; the narrative cuts off just as the protagonist enters the arena of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal pressure is high, effectively pitting Maren’s history of caution against the immediate need to understand her brother's risky path. The repair sequence serves as a strong escalation of this conflict, though the external stakes remain relatively contained.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is relatively low-resistance; the soldier arrives ready to confess, and Mira’s first attempt at the ritual succeeds without a need to pivot or escalate tactics. While the emotional stakes are clear, the lack of active opposition or a moment where the outcome is in doubt limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict is primarily internal but escalates cleanly as Mira transforms the mask from a restraint into a beacon. The decision to embrace "devastation" rather than numbness is a meaningful deepening of stakes with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the stakes of identity are declared, the on-page pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no obstacles, risks, or difficult trade-offs in the scene. The transition from wanderer to Keeper is smooth and inevitable, lacking the friction or felt cost required for high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist (the presence) is "not threatening," and Marcus has no internal resistance to the call. The stakes remain abstract ("engaging with mystery") rather than visceral or urgent. The narrative lacks a moment where Marcus must choose between safety and the unknown; his compliance is automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are atmospheric rather than urgent; the protagonist faces a task to complete rather than a conflict to resolve. With no antagonist and a machine that works with "absolute certainty," the outcome is never in doubt, and the "cost" is administrative (new library sections) rather than personal or visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The approaching storm provides clear, escalating pressure that forces the protagonist's movements and final risk-taking. The physical stakes (madness via temporal dissonance) effectively weight the choice to look into the mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely abstract (man vs. entropy) and lacks immediate on-page tension. The central stake of "honesty" is declared as a risk but never operationalized; Cassian never struggles to speak the truth, nor does the room threaten to wilt, leaving the climax without a tangible cost or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are existential and well-escalated: the tension between the need to catalogue and the encounter with the unnameable creates a strong internal pressure. The external pressure of the compass provides necessary momentum, though the "no return address" sender remains a convenient catalyst rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    Escalation is minimal; the storm serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure cooker forcing a difficult decision. The dominant stake is abstract, and the resolution arrives via convenient revelation rather than protagonist agency or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("idle fancy") and lack external pressure or tangible consequences for failure. The narrative arc accumulates observation without forcing a tightening of options or a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.8)
    Present-tense conflict is virtually absent; the Captain assists without comment, the environment is compliant, and the apparition appears willingly to deliver the message. There is no escalation of pressure or risk on the page, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is limited; the ritual proceeds linearly without significant external obstacles or an acute "tightening" of options, reading more as a procedural enactment than a conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are primarily internal and atmospheric, centering on the pressure to resolve the "pressure behind her eyes." While efficient for this length, the conflict lacks significant external friction or visible trade-offs beyond the acceptance of the burden. The escalation relies heavily on the protagonist's willingness to receive the message rather than overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, external threat, or internal dilemma that risks failure. The dominant stake (opening the vortex) is never in genuine jeopardy, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric; the "glue" constraint has ostensibly resolved before the main action, leaving only the timing of the storm as a pressure point. Since Elara is prepared and the equipment works, the external stakes—while high in theory (30,000 people)—lack immediate on-page jeopardy or obstruction. The narrative relies on the tension of anticipation rather than active resistance or escalating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or pressure; the environment is peaceful, the task is routine, and the "death" of the star is presented as a "strange peace." Without an obstacle, dilemma, or escalation of stakes, the story lacks narrative drive and fails to force a crystallization of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment is harsh but static, and the ghost is helpful rather than oppositional. There is no meaningful tightening of options or stakes; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, resulting in a low-tension experience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is mild and theoretical; despite the high stakes of "borrowed time," the character faces no immediate external opposition or worsening condition in the scene. The conflict remains an internal meditation rather than a pressure-cooker that forces a stance change through action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are low and purely contemplative; the conflict is abstract (healing vs. making) rather than urgent or costly. The bird's struggle resolves without the protagonist's direct intervention, and the poet's "recognition" comes without a visible price or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the work before death—is established, but the scene lacks immediate escalation or active pressure. The diagnosis acts as background context rather than a force driving a difficult on-page choice, resulting in low tension throughout the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative lacks active resistance or external pressure; the ascent is smooth and the epiphany arrives without a moment of doubt or struggle to force the realization. The stakes are purely philosophical and are resolved through meditation rather than a high-cost choice or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active resistance from the environment, the birds, or his own limitations. The "battlefield" is strictly metaphorical, and the lack of obstacles turns the story into a procedural ritual rather than a dramatic conflict with rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is static; the narrative summarizes past struggles ("tried every method") rather than dramatizing a specific, high-stakes failure or escalation in the present moment. The transition from searching to finding happens without a distinct deepening of the conflict or a new obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.4)
    The story lacks escalating pressure or a meaningful test of the protagonist's resolve. The central conflict resolves instantly upon the vision, offering a linear release of tension rather than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks sustained pressure; the first iteration resolves with simple acceptance, and the second introduces a complication that is immediately evaded by the protagonist's exit. Stakes are declared in exposition but never tested by a difficult on-page choice that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent in the scene's present tense; Mira faces no opposition from the environment, other characters, or time. The stakes (memory vs. oblivion) are high in concept but low in dramatic execution, as safety is assumed and the "interregnum" functions as background wallpaper rather than an active threat forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are established (sanctuary vs. memory), but the escalation is intellectualized. The struggle occurs in a summary block rather than an on-page confrontation of values, reducing the felt pressure of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The external pressure of the resuming thunder creates a functional ticking clock. However, the stakes are resolved too easily by the tapestry providing the answer. The cost—pulling threads from a found object—is symbolic but lacks visceral weight compared to the gravity of the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is weak; the opposition (the priests and the ritual) appears too late to force a desperate choice or trade-off. The protagonist overcomes the central obstacle with relative ease through the children, making the declared "price of forgiveness" feel theoretical rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    The escalation is effective, using the rising sea and failing seals to force the protagonist's focus. However, the resolution deflates the tension; the lethal threat evaporates due to a change in mindset rather than a costly sacrifice or clever maneuver, removing the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are internal but clearly defined (possessing vs. releasing). The final action of surrendering the painted shell is a visible cost that successfully resolves the tension, even if the escalation leading to it is somewhat quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist identifies the problem and immediately applies the winning solution without facing new obstacles or paying a price. The antagonism—weather and panic—crumbles instantly before the jasmine essence, robbing the climax of pressure or earned triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pressure is low as the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal dilemma; the "winter is coming" stake is stated but not felt through immediate constraint. The resolution arrives too smoothly, lacking a "tightening" beat where Mara must sacrifice something or take a risk to achieve the meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict remains abstract (memory vs. society) and retrospective, lacking immediate scene-level pressure or an antagonist to test the protagonist's resolve. The physical action of climbing, while described well, does not escalate into a dilemma that forces a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is internal and low-stakes; the protagonist faces little resistance beyond a puzzle that solves itself upon closer inspection. The resolution provides emotional gain without a visible, on-page cost or difficult trade-off, reducing the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    External pressure is established via the rising creek, but internal conflict is weak. The protagonist's "calm recognition" at the threshold removes the friction necessary for high stakes; the decision feels pre-ordained rather than a desperate choice under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—the threat of the "final warning"—is deflated by a misunderstanding trope rather than confronted with cost. The physical climb provides some pressure, but the emotional resolution comes too easily, lacking a sense of sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, the secondary character offers only supportive prompts ("Will you show us again?"), and the potential cost of the cooling sun is explicitly dismissed ("Maren did not mourn this"), neutralizing all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are conceptual (sanity, memory) and clearly signaled, but the conflict remains low-pressure and retrospective. The realization at the end is an earned stasis, but the path there lacks a decisive present-moment tightening or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the story is a low-stakes meditation on healing where the conflict is resolved by thinking rather than doing. There is no point where Elena's new worldview is tested, nor is there a visible price paid for her peace.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes remain internal and abstract, with the storm providing atmospheric pacing rather than active opposition. The conflict resolves without a difficult trade-off or visible sacrifice; the "shedding of cynicism" is a stated outcome rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate coherently as the "currents" thin and the orchard crews arrive. Eleanor’s decision to abandon her safety mechanism (metaphors) for a direct apology represents a meaningful tightening of conflict and a significant micro-choice. The cost is legible and felt: the apology cannot fix the past, only alter Eleanor's internal stance toward the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks active conflict or stakes; Elara faces no opposition, obstacle, or cost in her journey. The "deepest conflicts" mentioned are abstract properties of the library rather than immediate narrative pressures testing the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal and largely abstract; the "critical level" of the water creates only mild textural pressure rather than genuine narrative tension. The resolution involves no difficult trade-off or forced choice, resulting in low stakes despite the atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and theoretical ("revolution through permeable barriers") with minimal external pressure or immediate stakes. The "leaving" implies a cost, but since the decision is pre-made and the colleagues accept it instantly, the scene lacks palpable tension or resistance to the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clear but largely internal; the external conflict is muted because the father has already "surrendered" before the climax begins. There is no active opposition in the final scene to force a difficult choice or a meaningful tightening of tactics. The resolution comes too easily, lacking the friction that generates high-band dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes of witnessing versus isolation are clear, and the environmental shift (ventilation, streetlamps) provides a subtle escalation. Yet, the conflict remains textural rather than active; there is no specific, immediate obstacle challenging her routine tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are abstract and devoid of immediate pressure; there is no opposition or risk of failure in the scene. The archivist arrives, reflects, and leaves with a slightly deepened resolve, lacking the escalation required for a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (curing loneliness) is clear, but the external pressure is minimal; the antagonist is a helpful guide, and the obstacle is a simple conversation without active opposition. The "desperately jocular" defense mechanism collapses instantly upon hearing the rules, missing an opportunity for meaningful escalation or resistance. The cost of the trade (staying until midnight) is paid, but the transaction feels too smooth to generate high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is internal and conceptual, lacking active opposition or escalating stakes that threaten failure. The journey proceeds without significant obstacles or trade-offs; the protagonist simply continues walking until the environment permits success, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are dampened by Mira's established "strange comfort" with her situation; she begins and ends in a state of relative safety. The escalation relies on internal assertion rather than external pressure, and the "warm pen" functions as a subjective indicator of success rather than a forcing function for a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clearly defined as emotional and relational, but the pressure remains relatively low; the connection with Elena feels inevitable rather than fought for. The narrative lacks a moment of acute doubt or a "tightening" where Marina risks failure, making the emotional release feel slightly predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low in the present frame as the protagonist faces no active opposition; the central puzzle is solved instantly by "intuition." The significant cost (arson) is relegated to backstory, leaving the actual journey without felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the pressure within the scene is low; the protagonist executes a plan without encountering new active resistance or paying a fresh price. The antagonists (scientists) are abstract and absent, leaving the "hush" as a window of opportunity rather than a source of escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are established early, but the conflict resolves too cleanly. The antagonist (Captain Reyes) concedes immediately and completely without further complication, and the central struggle (the evacuation) happens off-page. The lack of a "dark night" moment or on-page reversal flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the stakes (implied suicide/despair) are high, the on-page conflict is low; the boy offers no resistance to the guardian's intervention, making the success feel inevitable rather than earned. The scene lacks a moment where the method fails or the cost of the "half-spoken secret" forces a difficult tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no dramatized conflict or resistance; the "rebellion" succeeds via summary without facing specific opposition or risk of failure. The story lacks a dominant stake tested in the present tense; the town's transformation is presented as an inevitable outcome of Eleanor's actions rather than a struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes of emotional imprisonment vs. freedom are clear, and the cost (leaving the heirloom/safety) is paid on the page. The escalation, however, is largely internal monologue prompted by the whale, lacking a sharpening of external obstacles before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is consistent and coherent; the surveillance state forces a crystallization of the protagonist's stance ("blankness"). While the external threat (drone) is past-tense, the immediate pressure of the speakers provides sufficient tension to drive the internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the external ban is already lifted, and the supernatural barrier acts as a phantom obstacle that yields immediately. The stakes remain abstract without a visible risk or price paid for the crossing, resulting in a low-tension "victory lap."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is minimal; the apprentice is immediately receptive, removing any significant obstacle to the protagonist's goal. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical, and the resolution comes without the protagonist having to overcome active opposition or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely abstract; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure shown on the page. The stakes are theoretical (the potential hollowness of the pilgrimage), and without a cost or trade-off to dramatize the difficulty, the tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is minimal; the antagonist (grief) is treated as a state to be soothed rather than an active force creating resistance in the scene. The "new arrival" offers no opposition, accepting the pendant and guidance immediately, which results in a lack of meaningful escalation or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of understanding a chaotic world are clear, but the on-page conflict is low-pressure; Soren yields to the process without significant resistance or complication. The escalation relies more on the ritual's progression than on an active struggle between opposing forces or values.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.7)
    External pressure is minimal; the protagonist masters the "unpredictable" dance immediately without visible struggle or setback. While the "capacity to wound" is stated, the on-page process is smooth and frictionless, reducing the sense of risk. The escalation comes from expository realization rather than a tightening of options or forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are high in concept (humanity's memory) but low in the scene; there is little immediate opposition or cost to Mira's actions. The conflict remains abstract and internal without a moment of "tightening" where her goal is genuinely tested or tactics must shift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear but largely retrospective; the pressure comes from memory rather than an immediate external threat. The escalation is subtle, tracking her shifting perspective, which works for this quiet mode but lacks acute tension.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clear, but the conflict is resolved primarily through external validation (the brother's telepathic reassurance) rather than a difficult active choice by the protagonist. The tension dissipates because the environment absolves her, rather than forcing her to pay a price for peace.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.5)
    External pressure is virtually nonexistent; there is no time limit, antagonist, or physical obstacle, leaving the stakes entirely abstract. The escalation relies solely on the clarifying vision, and the protagonist faces no significant trade-offs or risks until the final, relatively easy decision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely internal and the escalation consists largely of the character becoming tired and sitting down. The resolution lacks a necessary trade-off; gaining both rest and inspiration without sacrifice flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the merchant functions as a conversational prompt rather than a source of genuine pressure. The conflict resolves instantly upon a philosophical retort, lacking the escalation or necessary trade-offs required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "wall of mechanical chaos" surrenders to the first action taken (placing the gear). There is no meaningful tightening of options, no failure, and no moment where the protagonist must weigh competing values or pay a price to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are asserted ("freedom can feel like drowning") rather than tested through escalating pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition beyond her own hesitation. The climax is a realized epiphany rather than a forced decision under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal but vividly felt; the physical cost of the ascent provides a concrete anchor for the abstract emotional struggle. The tension tightens as Marcus weighs the safety of protocol against the risk of the "bronze trail," leading to a definitive choice that forecloses his previous passivity. The escalation is coherent and meaningful within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no active opposition or escalation on the page; the antagonist is distant and unaware, and the protagonist faces no immediate obstacles. The lack of resistance and specific on-page confrontation renders the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily thematic and internal—the validation of hope against a backdrop of grief—but the disruption of the "seven-year rhythm" provides sufficient immediate pressure. The conflict is low-key, functioning more as a puzzle than a crisis, but the "something that shouldn't have been there" successfully escalates the moment to a stance-shifting decision.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.0)
    On-page pressure is minimal; the antagonist is an abstract "lull" which offers no active opposition. The resolution is reached through a linear ascent to epiphany rather than a foreclosure of options or a sacrifice of competing values, resulting in a lack of genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—tradition versus evolution—is declared rather than tested against active opposition; the "elders" are off-screen abstractions. While the plants provide urgency, the resolution comes too easily via the kite and the plants' instructions, bypassing the need for Yara to make a difficult trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    The internal conflict is coherent and stakes are high (sanity/survival). The pressure of the "weather" of grief is well-rendered, though the lack of immediate, on-page external opposition limits the dramatic tension to the internal sphere.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.7)
    The pressure of the contracting walls provides a functional ticking clock, but the stakes dissolve without a difficult choice or trade-off. Mira’s decision to untangle the threads is an intuitive leap that meets no resistance, rendering the earlier physical threat toothless. The conflict resolves through surrender to the process, which fits the theme but lowers the narrative tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is low because the protagonist encounters no active opposition; the environment and the drone are passive, and his "serene anger" removes the potential for internal emotional conflict. The climax feels like a willing walk into a trap rather than a hard-won realization or a choice made under duress, resulting in negligible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the global stakes are high (ending a war), the on-page pressure is low; there is no immediate antagonist or time constraint forcing the decision. The choice to transmit is made too easily, dissolving the potential conflict between duty and truth without a visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is largely retrospective or abstract; the arrival of refugees offers no resistance or threat, making Mira's response automatic. The lack of escalation or a "meaningful tightening" of options leaves the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal—discipline against chaos—and the pressure scales effectively through the environment's reaction to his stillness. The stakes are heightened by the "others had tried" backstory, though this external opposition is off-page. The resolution feels earned through the specific application of the protagonist's skill.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are immediately clear and personal, pitting Eleanor’s integrity against her family’s dark legacy. The escalation occurs internally as she realizes the threat is not the external journalist but an internal saboteur, effectively raising the danger level. The cost is felt in the necessity of turning against her own organization to save it.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is a marked absence of active conflict or escalation; Mira faces no external opposition, equipment failure, or time pressure once inside the laboratory. The dominant stake—redemption—is achieved through procedural compliance with the machine's instructions rather than through a struggle that tests her commitment. The resolution feels unearned because the path to it is smoothed of all obstacles, leaving the victory without narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal stakes are clear, but the external pressure is low; the "villagers" are abstract. The resolution comes relatively easily through the discovery of the tile, lacking a sharp moment of risk or sacrifice before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear but the conflict remains largely internal and abstract; the antagonist is the passive weight of the past rather than an active pressure. The escalation is quiet, moving from observation to action without a moment of acute doubt or external resistance that forces a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (Mira's despair) is clear, but the scene lacks escalating pressure or opposition. Elara encounters no obstacles to her intervention, and Mira accepts the magical aid immediately, resulting in a conflict track that feels more atmospheric than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; the geode functions perfectly on the first try, offering no resistance, risk of failure, or unintended consequences. The stakes remain abstract concepts (connection vs. isolation) rather than immediate dramatic threats that escalate in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, time limit, or danger to force the protagonist's hand. The conflict is purely intellectual, and the environment cooperates fully (e.g., algae guiding her), resulting in a lack of escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the skepticism of other archivists is mentioned but never manifests as an obstacle, and the High Seers offer immediate validation. There is no moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are high in concept but low in execution; the on-page conflict consists primarily of waiting, and the tension resolves instantly upon the ally's arrival. The antagonist's threat is theoretical rather than a felt pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no dominant stake or coherent pressure; the waiting is described as serene rather than tense or costly. The arrival of the barge is a scheduled event rather than a result of agency or escalation, leaving the story without a central conflict engine.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no dramatic tension or escalation; the wasteland presents no immediate threat and the ruins offer no resistance. Without an active antagonist or a pressing clock, the stakes remain purely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no opposition, and the child yields to the comforting metaphor immediately, dissolving tension without a test. There is no escalation or "tightening" of the screw; the stakes remain abstract and are resolved without the protagonist having to pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract, lacking urgent pressure or escalation on the page. The resolution is a "gift" ending—a realization provided by the setting rather than earned through struggle—and there is no visible or felt cost to the protagonist's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—a desire for connection—remains largely abstract and retrospective. The narrative lacks urgent pressure; the conflict is resolved through a sudden idea rather than an escalation of stakes or a forced tradeoff, leaving the "cost" of exposing these secrets unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes (campus unity) are high, the antagonism is passive; the "tricksters" never actively counter-move or threaten Maya directly. The conflict is resolved through calculation rather than a high-stakes trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in low tension despite the "warring factions" backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pressure evaporates at the peak moment; the paralysis induced by the organ is resolved by a sudden recollection of the grandfather's letter, a "soft reset" that removes the obstacle without demand or sacrifice. There is no escalation of stakes, only a sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (peace vs. eternal silence), and the internal pressure of the "dormant empathy" provides momentum. However, the conflict is primarily man-against-nature/entropy with little active resistance; the protagonist's competence is never truly threatened, resulting in low tension regarding the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.6)
    The stakes are high and clear, but the conflict remains largely internal or summarized ("researchers exchanged glances"). The absence of a dramatized confrontation or a difficult real-time choice weakens the palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the story is an observational account of a supernatural event rather than a narrative of struggle or decision. The stakes remain abstract (witnessing/understanding) and the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs. The climax is a moment of seeing, not doing, and the resolution comes without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes (erasure vs. restart) are clear, the interpersonal conflict lacks heat; Elena yields to Marcus's metaphor with very little friction. The persuasion feels linear and lacks a moment where Marcus's goal is genuinely imperiled.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is internal and gentle ("tide of recognition") rather than pressured; the resolution is a low-stakes philosophical shift without a visible trade-off or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is weak; the antagonist (the frozen spell) is static and yields to Kaelen’s competence without forcing a hard trade-off or moment of doubt. The protagonist remains safe and in control throughout (“Kaelen did not flinch”), resulting in a low-stakes experience where the outcome is never in question.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are theoretical; there is no antagonist, internal resistance, or risk of failure to generate tension. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, and the "future arriving early" facilitates her goal rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high and the cost (loss of joy) is paid on the page. The conflict is internal and metaphysical; the escalation tracks well, though the climax relies on a realized transaction rather than a fierce struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the choice between safe stagnation and painful growth is dramatized effectively through the prop of the amplifier. The escalation from general malaise to a specific, haunting confrontation with the past works well to force the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are declared (hallucination vs. discovery) but face minimal onsite resistance; the seed is found and functions immediately. The lack of concrete obstacles or a "felt cost" beyond a joyful weeping keeps the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the stakes of preserving identities are abstract and never threatened by opposition, scarcity, or time pressure. The story relies on serenity and routine, resulting in zero narrative tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are abstract and thematic rather than visceral; Margret faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off in taking the shells. The choice feels inevitable rather than hard-won, as the "walls" she fights are philosophical concepts rather than immediate threats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (sanity/stability), but the conflict is resolved through passive reception of wisdom rather than active struggle. The protagonist accepts the graffiti's message immediately, lacking the resistance or misinterpretation that would generate higher narrative voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is low; the threat of the watch stopping is mentioned but never felt as an active constraint forcing a trade-off. The protagonist succeeds by walking and waiting, facing no meaningful obstacles or antagonists that require sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (certainty vs. longing) are clearly delineated by the vision, and the "promise losing its glow" creates a functional deadline that forces a choice. While the cost of the "empire of knowledge" is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page, the trade-off is legible and the ending forecloses the path of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is minimal; the primary obstacle (the fading spark) is overcome immediately by Mira's competence without escalation or doubt. The stakes are abstract ("oblivion"), and the lack of a "visible or felt cost" at the climax keeps the narrative flat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract ("hollowness"), lacking external pressure, time limits, or interpersonal friction in the present timeline. The escalation comes from climbing higher physically, but this does not translate into raised narrative stakes or a risk of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (maintaining her professional edge) faces no active opposition in the scene. The conflict with Thomas is a memory, leaving the present moment without pressure or escalation until the wind shifts by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is low-pressure and meditative, focusing on patience versus ignorance. While the cost is conceptually high (spending a lifetime learning), the lack of active resistance or on-page struggle limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretical ("dangers lurked") rather than immediate; there is no on-page antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure to test the protagonist's resolve. The narrative follows a sine wave of routine observation (pulse out, pulse back) without escalation or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict is resolved by external intervention rather than protagonist agency. When the ward dies—a moment ripe for pressure—the mist immediately intervenes, removing the need for Mira to make a difficult trade-off or face the consequences of the failure. The stakes dissolve rather than escalate, resulting in a low-tension climax.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.3)
    The stakes remain purely internal and abstract ("color of sound"). The resolution arrives via the coincidence of a meteor/lantern alignment rather than through protagonist agency or sacrifice, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or obstacle other than a lack of understanding, which is resolved by simple contemplation. The story lacks a moment of "tightening" where options narrow; the static swells, but the stakes remain abstract and the resolution comes without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain theoretical ("fears that haunted the dying") rather than immediate; the protagonist faces no external opposition or time constraint. The conflict is resolved through passive acceptance of the recording's advice, lacking a moment of tightening or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes (starvation) are high, they feel distant as the village is off-screen. The central conflict is resolved through patient observation rather than dramatic struggle or high-cost choices, resulting in low tension during the repair process.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is intellectual and retrospective—memory versus bureaucracy—without an immediate antagonist or time pressure to force a difficult trade-off. The "violence" of silence is stated rather than dramatized through a struggle that jeopardizes Elara's safety or standing in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("crumble into meaningless ash") but remain abstract and internal. The conflict between logic and intuition resolves too easily via instantaneous harmony, lacking the friction or escalation required to make the final transformation feel like a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clearly established through radio silence and the shifting cold front. The escalation is competent but safe, resolving through professional skill without forcing a painful trade-off or significant cost beyond stress.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.9)
    The conflict lacks genuine opposition; the clone offers no physical or effective verbal resistance, and the "custody battle" frame provides no immediate tactical pressure in the scene. The resolution arrives without a visible cost or sacrifice, as the blade conveniently "does not wound" but heals, rendering the stakes of the violence theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.5)
    The conflict between artistic integrity and commercial demand is abstract; without an on-page deadline, critic, or investor to force a decision, the stakes remain theoretical. The resolution arrives through the passive passage of time rather than active agency against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or deepening of stakes; the protagonist faces no active resistance, setbacks, or necessary adaptations in his process. The conflict remains abstract (Man vs. Stillness) and static, with the "stubborn stillness" never fighting back or forcing a tactical change. The narrative flatlines in tension, offering a procedural description rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal with no external resistance or genuine dilemma. The pendant arrives and is used without obstacle; the environment offers no pushback; the protagonist's mind offers no doubt. The conflict is theoretical, resolved by a sudden epiphany that bypasses the need for a high-stakes decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are established early, but the antagonist (the embers) is passive, leaving the escalation to rely on the environment (frost) and internal monologue. The renunciation at the climax is a strong choice that sharpens the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the external signal offers no active resistance, and the internal obstacle is resolved by a sudden "flash of intuition." The stakes remain abstract because failure carries no visible cost or deadline pressure beyond the mention of perigee.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("passengers dissolve") but never viscerally felt, as Maren's competence overwhelms the threat immediately. The conflict lacks escalation; a problem appears, she fixes it with "practiced ease," and the story ends without a moment of genuine doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension escalates coherently through the warping reflections, but the climax—described as "less dramatic... a hum"—dampens the external pressure. While the "unsettling calm" fits the tone, the stakes remain largely philosophical; a sharper, more immediate threat to her current task would have heightened the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story lacks immediate on-page pressure or opposition. The calculation process is described as "slow and meditative," and because Mira is unaware of the aliens' imminent departure until the end, there is no ticking clock to charge the scene. The stakes are high in theory but low in dramatic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes escalate effectively with the heartbeat and the voice, creating a thriller-like urgency ("Come find me"). However, the resolution—a philosophical acceptance that the dead just want to be heard—feels like a de-escalation that evades the concrete demand of the inciting voice, softening the potential tragedy or triumph into a safe thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are clearly defined as physical survival versus metaphysical discovery. The escalation works well, leading to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the cost (loss of physical life) is accepted for a new form of existence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are deeply felt but the external pressure is low; the conflict is largely retrospective and resolved through a quiet realization rather than active confrontation. The "escalation" is textural—a clearing of mental fog—which fits the tone but lacks high-stakes urgency or a distinct pivot point in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes of losing a language are clear, the on-page conflict lacks active opposition; the protagonist executes her plan with tools that work exactly as intended. The "curse" lifts without a dramatized sacrifice, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story lacks tangible opposition or escalation; Mira faces no significant barrier to entering the garden or accepting Amari's transformation. The conflict is theoretical (Amari vs. academia) rather than immediate and on-page. Consequently, the climax feels like an agreement reached without struggle or sacrifice, lowering the sense of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "pressure" is strictly thematic (silence vs. music) rather than an active force opposing the protagonist in the scene. The potential antagonists—the living statues—yield instantly without imposing any condition or threat ("held no malice"), removing all tension from the climax. There is no moment of doubt, no meaningful tightening of options, and no price paid for the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    External stakes are high (medicine for a dying relative), but internal conflict is absent; Marcus decides instantly without weighing the risk. The tightening (boy has no money) is functional, but the lack of reluctance or struggle flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the protagonist faces no obstacles, time pressure, or meaningful risks. The narrative is a sequence of fortunate events—hearing bells, finding a door, finding a halo—rather than a pressure-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the story depicts a known ritual ("began the ritual she had developed") rather than a high-stakes test. There is no opposition or escalation of pressure, merely a wait for the designated time.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition and overcomes the internal "ache of absence" without a visible cost or trade-off in the scene. The "runaway dream" simply finds her, and the magic works perfectly upon application, depriving the climax of potential stakes or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dramatic pressure is minimal as the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma on the page; the stakes remain abstract history, and success requires only patience, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is relatively low; the protagonist achieves his goal with minimal on-page resistance or cost beyond the initial dive. The stakes are personal but lack a tightening moment where failure is a genuine possibility or a difficult trade-off is required.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain low and primarily internal; while the emotional risk of rejection is stated, the interaction proceeds with minimal friction or escalation. The resolution—drinking tea—feels inevitable and smooth, lacking a moment where the "combative" aspect of the mentorship is truly tested by resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.5)
    The dominant stake—the fading of wonder—is abstract and declared rather than dramatized through immediate opposition or time pressure. There is no escalation of tension; the planting proceeds smoothly without risk of failure or personal cost to Elara. The conflict remains external and theoretical rather than felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The spirit's "tired" nature and Mira's high competence lower the stakes; the conflict remains procedural and atmospheric rather than urgent until the final image reweights the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is intellectual and summarized ("would have given anything") rather than viscerally dramatized in the scene. The central tension—curiosity vs. reverence—resolves too easily because the protagonist's "empathy" suppresses her "curiosity" without a visible on-page struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative lacks meaningful escalation or opposition; the retrieval of the globe is a linear procedural without significant risk or trade-off. The stakes remain abstract and internal, and the climax—reading a note—resolves the tension without forcing the protagonist to pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared ("refused to fade") but not tested against active opposition; the "urgency" is atmospheric rather than causal. No visible price is paid for the success, keeping tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal conflict is legible and the ending establishes a valid felt cost in the weight of the secret. However, the external stakes remain low as the cipher offers no resistance, missing an opportunity for a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is strictly internal and low-pressure; the protagonist observes and categorizes without facing an external obstacle or a forcing move that narrows her options. The "tightening" is purely interpretive, lacking a moment where she must sacrifice something to gain her resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the ticking clock provides a frame, the narrative lacks genuine escalation; Mira faces no setbacks, and the "cost" of the library's destruction is accepted rather than fought.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    Tension is low throughout; the stakes are purely intellectual and self-imposed, with no external time pressure or antagonism to force a meaningful tightening. The protagonist encounters no significant obstacles, making the eventual triumph feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces a gatekeeper (the mirror) that demands a specific toll she is already prepared to pay. The "sacrifice" of the gears is framed as a cost, but the immediate, superior reward ("infinite timelines") negates any sense of loss or trade-off. There is no active opposition or moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are generalized (survival vs. thriving) and lack immediate scenic pressure. The conflict is resolved through a summarized process of cooperation without a singular, high-tension turning point or a visible trade-off that forces a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretically absolute (the end of the world) but generate no narrative tension because the protagonist accepts them without resistance. There is no opposition, external or internal, to force an escalation of tactics or reveal character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ticking clock (frost) provides pressure, but the protagonist's immunity to the birds lowers the immediate physical stakes for her. The conflict is primarily a race against time rather than a test of agency against active opposition, making the success feel slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist arrives with guilt and leaves with peace via intellectual processing, lacking a decisive on-page test or cost. The pressure dissolves through observation rather than tightening options or forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is effectively absent; the "lull" explicitly removes pressure, creating a vacuum where the protagonist faces no risk or opposition. There is no meaningful tightening of stakes or narrowing of options, resulting in a flat dramatic arc that fails to test the character.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes (being overwhelmed by remorse) are established early, but the conflict plays out as "Man vs. Nature" where the protagonist prevails through steady competence without significant opposition. The resolution feels inevitable once the cooking begins; the story would benefit from a moment where the "accumulated weight" actively resists her efforts or forces a harder trade-off than mere time.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.7)
    The central conflict—the brothers' estrangement—resolves with minimal resistance once Elara intervenes, lowering the stakes. The "cost" of the resolution is metaphorical rather than felt or enacted on the page, resulting in a low-pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.0)
    There are no functional stakes or opposition; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, time pressure, or competing needs. The narrative is a linear progression of acquisition and success without any tightening of tension or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the one-hour clock provides a container, the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist ascends and solves the puzzle with competence rather than struggle. The "fear" mentioned is told rather than felt, and the junction offers a soft choice without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (communication/breaking silence) is clear, but the dramatic pressure is low. The environment offers no active resistance, and the protagonist faces no trade-offs or sacrifices to achieve her goal. The escalation is procedural—she simply performs her skill—rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and retrospective; there is very little immediate pressure or opposition in the scene to force a difficult decision. The stakes are intellectual rather than visceral, leading to a low-tension experience.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical; while the diary is important to Mira, the lack of external pressure or a "ticking clock" beyond the ambient fireworks keeps tension low. The obstacle is overcome by patience and intuition rather than a high-stakes trade-off or a moment of genuine peril, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are defined, but the escalation is summarized rather than experienced. The critical turning point—learning to endure the stench—happens in a narrative gloss ("moments when its developing scent nearly drove her from the greenhouse") rather than in a dramatized beat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the gravity inversion is a scheduled event rather than an antagonist, and the protagonist faces no obstacles to her goal. The story functions as a procedural tour rather than a narrative with escalating pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure is coherent and atmospheric, escalating through the sensory intensity of the wind and the intellectual puzzle. While the stakes are clear (understanding the convergence), the lack of an immediate, active counter-force or time-critical failure state keeps the conflict largely cerebral. The tension holds, but the personal risk feels managed rather than desperate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment welcomes the protagonist and the task faces no resistance. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("world's slow cooling") that are never tested by concrete on-page threats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and retrospective; the pressure is memory-based rather than immediate. The "tightening" is merely spatial (reaching the crossing), and the resolution comes without a forcing mechanism or visible sacrifice in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vanishing stars provide a coherent Situational drive, creating a ticking clock that pressures the protagonist. However, Maren's response is one of acceptance and submission rather than active agency; the "cost" of dissolution is framed as liberation, which dampens the sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal and are resolved by the mentor's explanation rather than the protagonist's active struggle. The escalation relies on the atmosphere intensifying until a vision appears to solve the problem, lacking a moment where Elara must risk something to gain the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical; there is no active opposition or risk of failure, only a wait for enlightenment. The conflict is internal but resolved instantly by the vision, lacking the friction of a difficult trade-off or a "conceptual repricing" with a heavy price. The antagonist is a straw man ("scientists refused to believe"), which lowers the intellectual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretically high (existence vs. oblivion), but the conflict is resolved without struggle; the protagonist accepts the ultimate cost immediately upon realizing it. The absence of an antagonist or a moment of genuine dilemma flattens the tension, making the sacrifice feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes are high (survival of the ecosystem), the conflict is diffused over a long timeframe; the lack of a specific antagonist or crisis point in a specific scene reduces the felt pressure. The cost ("patience," "quiet hours") is stated in summary rather than paid in a visceral, on-page moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear and the pressure builds coherently as she ascends the catwalk. The cost is felt—a resignation to carrying a wound rather than healing it—satisfying the requirement for a meaningful tightening of the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is virtually no escalation or active opposition; the lighthouse's "refusal" is passive, and Ashford assists rather than hinders. The stakes are theoretical (ships might crash) rather than immediate, and the tension evaporates instantly when Maren performs the ritual without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or pressure; the task is described as "simple" and the protagonist feels only "joy." Success is instant and guaranteed, leaving the declared "burden" undramatized and stakes flat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.0)
    Pressure is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external resistance, time limit, or antagonist. The stakes are purely philosophical, and the resolution comes as a "net gain" of wisdom without a visible cost or hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low throughout. While the storm provides atmospheric tension, the stakes remain abstract (understanding vs. confusion) rather than immediate or perilous. The protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a sacrifice, leaving the narrative flat in terms of dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential. The conflict tightens effectively when Elara realizes the "bound release" requires a personal sacrifice (burning her memories), though this internal hurdle is overcome somewhat quickly in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clear but the escalation is almost entirely internal and retrospective; the environment offers comfort rather than pressure. The conflict resolves through a convenient philosophical realization rather than a forced trade-off or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=2.8)
    Narrative pressure is virtually nonexistent; the "struggle" against decay is presented as a gentle, successful routine rather than a conflict. There is no escalation, no moment where the protagonist must risk something, and no tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is largely abstract (entropy vs. preservation) and resolves with minimal resistance; the protagonist reframes the threat immediately upon encountering it. The lack of distinct escalation or narrowing of options—she simply looks closer and accepts the change—keeps the stakes low despite the conceptual magnitude.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the on-page conflict is low-intensity; the required "thwart" action is contemplated rather than dramatized, leaving the immediate pressure unresolved at the cut.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely intellectual (curiosity about weather-carrying), and the encounter lacks interpersonal friction or danger. The conversation is polite and linear, escalating only to a shared understanding without a moment where the protagonist must risk something to gain the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict remains largely internal and retrospective, lacking active opposition or escalating costs within the scene itself. The resolution comes too easily; without a concrete obstacle or trade-off in the cave, the decision to paint feels like a low-stakes progression rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is minimal. The dominant stake (truth) is clear, but Mira faces no active opposition—the city does not impede her, the map yields its secrets easily, and the toxic environment is ambient rather than an obstacle. The cost of her final decision is implied (social isolation/safety) but not viscerally felt or dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=1.2)
    There is a complete absence of conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the materials, or the visitor. The stakes remain purely philosophical and are never threatened or tested on the page. Without pressure, the "truth" Elara seeks feels inevitable and cheap.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear, but the resolution comes from an innate ability ("containment was her gift") rather than a hard-won adaptation under pressure. The final state of being "beautifully broken" reads as an aesthetic upgrade rather than a felt price, reducing the impact of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely external to the protagonist, who acts as a bystander to a past tragedy. There is no escalation or tightening of options; the "intrusion" of the delivery truck imposes no actual urgency, and the resolution is achieved without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    There is virtually no on-page conflict or escalation; the plan works perfectly, the "dice" explicitly reject chance, and the environment yields without resistance. The story lacks a moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist must make a difficult trade-off. Without an antagonist or a malfunction to force a "tightening" of options, the stakes remain theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the "gravitational labyrinth" functions more as a conveyor belt than a crucible. The tension is low because failure never feels like a genuine possibility; she is pulled toward the solution by the magic itself.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are high in concept (unmaking fate) but the on-page conflict is low-pressure and purely internal. The resolution comes through a shift in perception rather than a hard trade-off, making the "hush" feel relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—the trade-off between knowing the objective truth and maintaining a profound connection—is escalated clearly through the "interrogation" scene. The pressure builds effectively as Elena pieces together the tutor's nature, culminating in a moment where she must choose between exposing the ghost or accepting the "membrane" of fiction. The cost of this choice is felt, though the conflict remains relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active external opposition, and her internal skepticism offers little resistance to the plot's demands. The lack of meaningful pressure or high stakes makes the resolution feel inevitable and smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no on-page conflict; the protagonist meets an ally, accepts a task, and completes it without opposition. The "calibrated treason" is explained rather than tested, and the resolution comes via a sudden magical convenience (the crumbling wall) rather than a pressure-driven decision.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is retrospective and abstract, summarized as "webs of intrigue" from the past rather than dramatized as an immediate obstacle. There is no active opposition or escalation on the page; the protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, simply waiting for an external alignment to occur.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are abstract and retrospective; the mystery is presented as already solved via summary, removing tension. There is no active resistance or antagonist to force meaningful escalation, rendering the "investigation" a fait accompli.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the stakes remain purely intellectual ("hidden effort") with no external pressure or urgent internal dilemma. There is no tangible trade-off or risk involved in the decision to whistle, resulting in a flat trajectory where nothing is truly at hazard.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.1)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual—truth versus myth—and the antagonist is the abstract weight of public opinion. Because the decoding process happens in summary, Mira faces no acute, moment-to-moment pressure or risk of failure on the page, resulting in low immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is strictly linear and external (the storm intensifies), lacking a "tightening" where the protagonist must choose between narrowing options. The dominant stake—validation of the prophecy—is resolved by an external arrival rather than Elara's agency, renunciation, or endurance in the face of a new obstacle. There is no moment where she risks something to achieve the outcome; she simply endures until it happens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, and the pivotal choice to hand over the box is resolved with only "gentle reluctance." The stakes remain abstract and thematic rather than felt, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are established early and clearly, but the conflict remains external and is resolved by the protagonist simply trying harder/better. The lack of a complicating reversal or sacrifice limits the tension's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story lacks active opposition or rising pressure; the conflict is merely a waiting game that resolves itself when the environment signals readiness. There is no meaningful tightening of options or moment where the protagonist must sacrifice one desire for another. The stakes remain abstract ("changes that no other cartographer would think to map") rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes of truth versus bureaucracy are declared, the protagonist's victory is unearned because the crucial information is provided by a vision rather than seized through conflict or deduction. The resolution feels inevitable rather than fought for, as the antagonist (Chen) is not present to apply counter-pressure during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—spiritual integrity versus mechanical function—and pressure is low-voltage but coherent. The hesitation and subsequent decision represent a meaningful deepening, though the cost is more conceptual (effort/intention) than visceral or high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; there is little on-page opposition or risk of failure. The external pressure (the sea, the mechanics, the judgment of peers) is mentioned but rarely forces a difficult trade-off in the moment. The escalation is functional but lacks the tightening noose required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; the corporate antagonist is passive, represented only by old deletion logs rather than active opposition. The "impenetrable" firewalls offer no actual resistance, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where the protagonist's success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    Tension is minimal; there is no antagonist or obstacle that "calm intuition" cannot immediately solve. The stakes remain theoretical ("hunger," "safety") until the final lines, and the conflict is resolved by a philosophical realization that costs Mira nothing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is primarily contemplative; while the stakes are life-and-death, the on-page conflict is low-voltage. The resolution arrives through observation (the wind, the ice) rather than a difficult active choice or sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and retrospective; the relationship ended years ago, and the internal conflict ("grief vs. acceptance") is resolved through safe contemplation. There is no active "tightening" or risk in the present scene, and the realization feels like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned victory over genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.2)
    Dramatic conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, obstacle, or immediate cost in the dramatized moment. The stakes remain abstract and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks a central conflict or meaningful obstacles; the task is performed in a vacuum of "smooth" execution. There is no antagonist, time pressure, or internal resistance to generate stakes. The "pain" mentioned is historical and abstract, leaving the on-page action devoid of tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    External pressure is minimal; the conflict is entirely internal and philosophical, lacking a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely threatened. While the realization is profound, it comes without significant resistance or "tightening" of options. The stakes are clear but low-voltage, missing the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tension operates primarily on an atmospheric level; the "tidal longing" and the threat of forgetting provide coherent pressure. The escalation is textural, deepening as Mira moves into the center of the garden. While effective as a lyric piece, the conflict lacks a sharp, immediate obstacle or cost in the moment beyond the inherent difficulty of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes are clearly defined and resolved through the act of taking the photograph. However, the external pressure (the tremor) is resolved too easily, serving merely as a metaphorical mirror rather than a distinct obstacle with its own weight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are high and personal, established immediately by the blood work and escalated by the intimacy of the session. The conflict is internal but dramatized through the interaction; Margery’s grip serves as a pivotal deepening that pierces Elara’s professional veil. The cost—the loss of the distinction between healer and dying patient—is felt in the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist encounters no significant setbacks, failure states, or external opposition once the key is found. The narrative tracks a linear path to success without escalating cost or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is emotional/spiritual resolution, pitted against the bureaucratic pressure of the Ministry. The conflict is internal but active; Elara’s choice to use the tooth rather than merely bury the body is a decisive act of agency. The cost is felt in the weight of the eighteen years lost to the "cleft in certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are internal and low-pressure; the protagonist faces no active antagonist, time limit, or risk of failure. The resolution is gifted by the discovery of the pearl rather than earned through sacrifice or ingenuity in the face of opposition. The "cost" is paid entirely in the backstory, leaving the present-day action devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes feel somewhat low and retrospective; the conflict centers on processing a fait accompli (the viral confession) rather than navigating a live, high-pressure dilemma. The phone call introduces immediate tension, but the resolution—a quiet lie—is a subtle shift that leaves the narrative pressure feeling muted.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved too easily; the protagonist's "fear" dissolves upon seeing the ghosts without a testing moment or sacrifice. The escalation is textural (seeing more ghosts) rather than causal, leading to a soft landing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no active opposition or on-page escalation; the pressure of the "17-year wait" is backstory, not present dramatic conflict. Elara encounters no obstacles during the ritual—the vine accepts the soil, the song works instantly, and the sun rises on cue—leaving the stakes untested.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, as the cold is dismissed ("warm enough") and the task proceeds without error. While there is a procedural escalation toward the sealing, the lack of a live threat or trade-off leaves the stakes abstract and the victory inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; the narrative lacks urgent pressure or a distinct antagonist. The stakes remain largely philosophical ("restoring wonder"), and the resolution comes through immediate insight rather than escalating choices or forced trade-offs. While the decision to spend seasons on the repair represents a cost (Earned Stasis), the absence of doubt or friction lowers the dramatic voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, and the protagonist’s compliance removes immediate tension. While the cost (calcification) is visible and permanent, the absence of a live alternative or active resistance makes the stakes feel settled before the scene begins.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is quiet but coherent under the Accumulative lens; the choice to ignore the kettle (the demanding world) in favor of the work sets a clear micro-stake. The tension is maintained well through the carving process, though the external pressure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear (internal peace), and the pressure escalates through the physical manifestation of the collected stories. The conflict remains somewhat static until the final confrontation, but the cost of the final resignation is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes flatline because there is no active opposition; the mineral deposits are a static obstacle easily overcome by off-screen math. The protagonist faces no trade-offs, risks, or sacrifices, resulting in a victory that feels inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension deflates the moment the bear arrives, as the narrator explicitly states, "I did not fear it," removing the potential for external pressure to force the internal change. The dominant stake (making peace) is resolved through meditation rather than a high-stakes trade-off, leaving the climax feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces a puzzle she is perfectly equipped to solve without opposition or resource constraints. The "serene upheaval" at the end frames the outcome as pure gain, lacking the necessary trade-off or price required for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("understanding"), and there is virtually no opposition or pressure on the page. The protagonist faces no obstacles; he wishes to see, applies the glass, and sees. Without a moment of doubt, risk, or trade-off, the narrative lacks the tension necessary for a publishable story.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal and purely internal; the protagonist surrenders to the "gravity of endings" without testing other options, reducing the stakes from a survival crisis to a philosophical meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high in theory (fate of the kingdom), but the on-page pressure is low; the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative. The resolution comes too easily via the magical text on the egg, meaning the protagonist doesn't have to make a difficult trade-off or face a true test of his original mission (the kill-switch) before abandoning it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are abstract and internal, centering on a desire for peace that is achieved without significant resistance or escalation in the scene. There is no moment where the protagonist is truly tested or forced to trade one value for another; the tension is atmospheric rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time crunch, or mutually exclusive trade-off, merely a sequence of tasks to complete. The stakes remain abstract and the "cost" of the final release is mild, lacking visceral impact on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stakes are relatively low and abstract; the "crisis" is internal and resolved almost immediately by a shift in perspective. The tension between the "serenity" of the garden and the "ticking" of the gear is promising but de-escalated quickly by the protagonist's acceptance. The cost—a "troubling" feeling—is stated rather than demonstrated through consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is minimal throughout, with no antagonist or significant obstacle challenging Elara's goal. The "tightening" is limited to the progression of dusk, and the resolution arrives without a moment of doubt or a trade-off that would heighten the stakes. The conflict remains abstract and internal without manifesting in a costly on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are clear but predominantly internal and retrospective; the conflict lacks active, present-moment pressure beyond the ticking clock. The "tightening" is rhythmic rather than causal—he waits for a time, feels a feeling, and descends. The cost is felt, but the absence of a live, opposing force limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.6)
    The story lacks conflict, opposition, or stakes; the gardener descends and decodes a message with immediate success and no cost. There is no pressure, time constraint, or risk of failure to drive the narrative momentum. The resolution is a foregone conclusion from the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict remains entirely abstract and internal, centering on the intellectual difficulty of the task rather than dramatized opposition. The stakes (innovation, the future) are declared in exposition but never tested or escalated through concrete on-page struggle or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; the patrols are a hypothetical background threat rather than an immediate pressure. There is no tightening of stakes, no meaningful reversal, and no cost paid by the protagonist to execute her will.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely reflective and internal; the ritual proceeds without external obstacles or escalating costs that force a difficult trade-off. The stakes remain abstract ("approached through powder") rather than viscerally felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is entirely retrospective and abstract (narrator vs. official history), lacking immediate scene-level pressure. There is no on-page antagonist, time constraint, or physical obstacle forcing the narrator to adapt tactics in the present moment. The stakes, while intellectually high, generate no dramatic tension because the outcome of this specific reflection is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.3)
    The scene lacks significant conflict or escalation; the student arrives, Eleanor plays a scale, and he immediately relaxes without resistance or complication. The stakes are intelligible but theoretical, as the outcome appears assured by Eleanor's established wisdom, resulting in a flat dramatic arc with minimal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-voltage; the opposition is a memory of "researchers" or general decay, offering no active resistance in the scene. The climax lacks a trade-off; Elena consumes the fruit and gains wisdom without facing a dilemma that forces her to prioritize one value over another.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    Although the background stakes are high, the on-page conflict is minimal, reduced to a brief moment of internal hesitation that is quickly resolved by external encouragement. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or escalating pressure, leading to a climax that lacks tension or a sense of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are purely conceptual, lacking active resistance or a concrete risk of failure. The escalation is linear—light fading, awareness deepening—rather than pressured, resulting in a contemplative arc that feels low-tension despite the atmospheric density.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    External conflict is virtually absent, and internal conflict resolves too easily via the alchemist's memory. The stakes are philosophical ("certainty vs. understanding") rather than visceral; Thalassor faces no opposition or cost in abandoning his three-millennia purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are purely intellectual/internal, which limits the tension. The escalation comes from re-evaluating data rather than rising pressure or diminishing resources, resulting in a low-heat conflict that resolves largely through a change in mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is low-stakes and internal, lacking significant pressure or opposition beyond the protagonist's baseline condition. The resolution comes too easily—a passive reception of a vision—without forcing a difficult trade-off or a confrontation with the cost of her obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict between safety and cultural survival is well-defined, and the stakes escalate logically as the physical sanctuary fails. The final choice forecloses the option of hiding, carrying a felt cost of safety, though the external antagonism remains largely off-screen.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are existential and clear: submission to fate versus total erasure. The escalation is steady, moving from the external warning of the stone to the irreversible action of the spin. The cost—the dissolution of the world and self—is the ultimate price, fitting the "bleak exhilaration" of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are effectively raised through the "photographically cursed" element, providing a tangible clock and visible consequence. The cost of resolution—admitting to suicidal ideation—is a significant and well-executed emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical (order vs. chaos) rather than visceral, as the protagonist handles the "larger wave" with immediate, practiced precision. There is no escalation of risk or genuine doubt; the obstacle is converted into harmony without resistance, leaving the conflict feeling low-stakes and performative.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high (survival of the city), but the immediate on-page pressure is low; the Council's threat is abstract and distant, and the lock (the shell patterns) yields instantly to Mira's pre-existing knowledge. The scene lacks a moment where the protagonist must overcome genuine resistance or pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes—historical truth versus community stability—are intellectually clear but lack dramatic urgency in the moment. Because the protagonist arrives already resolved to "confront" the issue, the internal conflict feels theoretical rather than active; there is no moment where the outcome seems truly in doubt. The cost is understood abstractly but not felt as a pressing, immediate burden on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared but not tested. The threat of the tide ("cut off for hours") is introduced to build tension but is resolved without struggle when she leaves easily. The primary conflict is internal, but the protagonist faces no significant opposition or trade-off to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative lacks urgent stakes or meaningful opposition; the discovery process is frictionless, with no risk of failure or external threat. Mira faces no difficult trade-offs or immediate dangers, making the "courage" mentioned in the theme felt only in the abstract. The escalation is purely informational rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are deeply personal and the pressure of grief is constant, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the scene lacks sharp escalation or a distinct tightening of options; the climax (viewing the dream) is a moment of confirmation rather than a shift in the conflict structure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and retrospective; the cooling circuit breakers provide a clock but do not force a tactical decision or escalation. The stakes are philosophical, lacking a concrete on-page test or trade-off beyond the protagonist's existing emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or difficult trade-offs, and the "resistance" of the machine is overcome instantly. The stakes remain theoretical, as there is no apparent consequence for failure or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict is entirely internal, lacking external opposition or a tightening clock to force a decision. The escalation is linear—sifting leads to finding—and the resolution comes from the object's discovery rather than a protagonist's decisive action to sacrifice or change.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is extremely low; the adversary is immediately cooperative ("I wasn't sure you would come" is the only friction), and they proceed in perfect synchronization. There is no escalation of stakes in the scene, no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and no trade-off forced upon the protagonist beyond the pre-meditated decision to let go.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear, and the internal pressure of past failure is palpable. The external pressure (current/chop) is mild, serving mostly as a backdrop for the internal realization, but the "one pole at a time" constraint provides a tangible focus for the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low because the "labyrinth of choices" presents no actual obstacles or trade-offs; the memory wipe conveniently removes the difficulty of decision-making. The protagonist faces no significant opposition, turning the journey into a linear progression without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist moves from fear to readiness without an on-page testing of that resolve. The central conflict dissolves rather than escalating, as the anticipated terrible price is revealed to be a gift without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are established early and the internal pressure is coherent. The escalation focuses on the ritual preparation, though the conflict is resolved somewhat swiftly by the sudden insight. The physical cost (the cut) effectively anchors the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (opening the dimension) is clear, but the narrative lacks meaningful opposition or escalation. The process proceeds without setbacks, external threats, or internal hesitation, resulting in a low-pressure sequence that feels more like a procedural than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the volcano rumbles "not in threat," and the release of the bugs meets no internal or external resistance. Without an antagonist or a difficult trade-off in the present moment, the stakes remain abstract and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.9)
    External conflict is negligible; the other guards are merely "confused," providing no active opposition or time pressure during the investigation. The protagonist faces no obstacles or costs, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The decision to sacrifice the "last of her collapsed star dust" creates a clear, irreversible cost that charges the climax with genuine risk. The dominant stake (connection vs. loss) is tightened effectively by this resource scarcity, and the resolution is driven by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are legible but the pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric. The escalation relies on the storm's arrival rather than an active antagonist or tightening dilemma; the final choice is a release of tension rather than a navigation of high-cost trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.7)
    Escalation is linear and lacks a moment of genuine doubt or deepening pressure; the outcome feels predetermined by Varn's established superiority. The stakes remain intellectual abstractions ("nature of truth") without translating into visceral, felt consequences for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story relies on a gentle, accumulative pressure rather than sharp conflict or distinct reversals. While the internal stakes of connection are clear, the external pressure is minimal, and the "resistance" remains abstract and low-risk, resulting in a lack of palpable on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are intensely personal and internal, driven by the specific window of the "converging" worlds. While external resistance is minimal, the pressure of the fading light and the erratic compasses creates sufficient situational urgency. The cost—permanent detachment from the real world—is felt, though a sharper sense of what he is neglecting in the present would heighten the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    One dominant stake (cultural memory) is clearly signaled, and the monsoon creates effective time pressure. The conflict, however, remains low-friction; the protagonist faces no significant external opposition or internal wavering during the ascent, making the success feel inevitable rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is low throughout; the narrative functions more as a meditation than a conflict, with no active opposition or escalating stakes visible on the page. The turning point—light hitting a silver thread—is an external coincidence rather than a result of the protagonist's agency or endurance, leaving the resolution feeling unearned.

    Dominant stake (preserve seeds vs. soldiers) signaled early, accumulative escalation via access sequence narrowing to post-soldier planting; agency in decoding/entering forecloses immediate planting with patience cost. One tightening sufficient; visible price (chains, timing) alters tactics legibly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (confront inherited curse/fear) deepens accumulatively via mirror escalation to confession reversal, narrowing to renunciation with legible cost (luminance dims, dictionary abandoned). Protagonist agency drives peak; no abstract stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she keep forcing cosmic drama onto every death?—is signaled early. The butterfly’s gradual decay supplies one decisive tightening that repatterns her interpretive lens; cost is the loss of her prior certainty. Under Accumulative lens, the slow dust shift is sufficient escalation. No secondary pressure or antagonist appears, so the escalation is single-note; that caps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—turn evidence into actionable pursuit—tightens once when frost-etched paths decode the ledger. Protagonist agency drives the escalation: she chooses to read the land and reverse roles. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence, embrace of violence implicit in pursuit) but not yet visceral. Enough for the length, but lack of tangible price on-page holds it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove silence measurable—tightens through rising thermal anomalies until the performance-hall “breathing” forces her surrender to a different metric; the price is the fork’s eternal muteness and her abandonment of sound-recovery. One meaningful deepening, no abstract escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: will Aldric answer the distress call of unrecovered souls? Escalation is accretive—each soul he listens to knits the lens tighter and binds him closer to perpetual service; the tightening is visible on the object itself. Agency is renunciation: he forfeits retirement-in-stillness for eternal lighthouse-keeper duty, a price legible in the final image of fresh coffee poured only to wait. Coincidence operates only as inciting trigger, never as resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep memory alive during slow strangulation—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens through each beat: rations shrink, gardens test, anonymity risks exposure. Midnight runs create one visible price: Mira forfeits rest and safety, shown not told. Bell summons crystallizes stance; no coincidence, no fake reversal. Lacks a second irreversible forfeiture to push into 8.8 band, but single meaningful tightening satisfies short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“to heal unused love”—is signaled by paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: breathing shifts from shallow to mourning to acceptance, narrowing options to “receive and release.” Cost is conceptual but legible—she permanently carries the transformed current back into the world. Agency is present (she angles the lens), yet the beat is more receptive than risky; no credible loss of tool, stamina, or social credit is dramatized, keeping it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“save the photographs by feeling time”—is signaled early and deepens when the halo vision shows her older self. One accretive tightening suffices: the realization that garden geometry must be completed. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she commits to an unmapped maze that will consume her future. Pressure stays coherent under textural lens; no reversal is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve seed diversity—arrives early and tightens once: soldiers will come, she must wait. The piano-key gambit is the single meaningful escalation that narrows options (vault opens, but timing is now enemy-controlled). Cost is legible—she accepts temporal captivity to secure seeds—yet the beat is internal; no immediate loss of a specific seed or ally on the page keeps it just shy of the 8.8 band. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can Mira reveal an untravelled path without violating her ethic of “borrowing.” Pressure mounts through accumulating light loss; the sunset’s fade is the tightening clock. The pour of moonbeam is the single decisive escalation that narrows options—once done, the portrait is fixed. Cost is displaced onto the subject; her own risk remains theoretical, capping intensity at 7.6.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—protective inquiry versus exposed vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens once: the bookmark scar and cascading ice force the decision to keep the vessel open-mouthed, renouncing total enclosure. Accumulative pressure suffices; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible in the renunciation of absolute safety. A second, sharper trade-off would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—owning her true identity—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when decryption forecloses the “harmless pawn” option. One meaningful turn: she pivots from flight to confrontation under rising shelf-pressure. Cost is visible: trembling throat, clutched cast-shield, permanent relational rupture with Daniel. Agency is hers; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“draw the map before total darkness”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens once: storm pause gives the single window to charcoal the final page. No external antagonist; pressure is situational/time-bound; the deepening is the star’s flicker that forces the last stroke. Cost is her life, paid off-stage in the marbled hush, legible under Accumulative lens. Could reach 9+ if the price had bitten during the act rather than after.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—continuity of self—remains abstract; no concrete risk (shutdown, memory wipe, exile) is introduced. Pressure is lyrical repetition, not rising cost. The third loop is mentioned, but the reader sees no new consequence or narrowed option. Music deepens mood but does not test or endanger the robot; escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can transparency survive once words fail? Escalation is textural—each symbol (Mira’s circles/line, registrar’s mirror-in-mirror) deepens density until the hand-touch refracts trust into communal possibility. No reversal, but one meaningful tightening: registrar shifts from observer to responder, costing anonymity. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; cost visible in final crowd advance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: preserving the maze’s quiet integrity against commodification. Pressure tightens once when Elara redirects investors; the victory is off-page, so escalation is textural—accumulated marbles and seasons—rather than a fresh reversal. Cost is conceptual but visible: each marble fracture indexes a measurable luck-loss she still carries. Sufficient for the lyric mode, yet a dramatized present-tense threat could have sharpened the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens once when holographic grids reveal dual molt phases; the lever pull deepens rather than reverses, forcing her hypothesis into undeniable reality. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the universe’s rule-set is reweighted, and the station’s perpetual cold acts as persistent constraint. Under Accumulative lens, a single meaningful intensification suffices, and it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode Marco’s message before the flood destroys it—tightens once: water rises, ink bleeds, she must play now. Her agency drives escalation; she chooses to stay, wade, play, and ultimately leave. No coincidences resolve tension; the flood complicates but never rescues. Cost is conceptual (knowledge of buried secret) rather than visceral, capping entry into 8.8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she bear to forecast again after killing Elena—tightens when pressure plummets and the aurora flares. Tightening beat: touching the smudge narrows her options to “warn or flee”; she chooses warn, price = permanent self-indictment kept conscious. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (aurora timing) but does not resolve. Cost is visible: her throat swallows old terror along with the stone of truth, now legible in the final broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—burden of an unspoken truth—tightens when the ghost shift forces Marcus from listener to speaker. One meaningful escalation: radio voices multiply until silence demands his own confession. Pressure stays situational but coherent; coincidence (wheel moves alone) complicates, does not resolve. Cost is conceptual—privacy of silence forever lost—visible in the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—unjudging witness of slow decay—is declared early and never tightens; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Escalation is absent; the piece accumulates texture rather than pressure. The obsidian silence offers healing, but this is benefit, not cost, undermining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder without forcing it”—tightens when totality demands absolute silence from Elara; her renunciation of sound forecloses her usual therapeutic tool with visible professional cost. Accumulative pressure mounts via shadow density and children’s gaze rather than causal reversals, sufficient for 600-word frame. The hand-touch micro-turn reweights options: silence has succeeded where music might have failed. Cost is legible on page, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—can stories reboot dreams?—is declared early but never tested by an on-page obstacle or irreversible choice. No middle beat narrows options; Elias simply keeps reading. Cost is conceptual only (world stayed cracked), not personalized or paid. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, so pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—maintaining exile versus being reactivated—tightens once when the unopened summons arrives; the refusal is solitary, so pressure is conceptual rather than interpersonal, but the paste-making act visibly forecloses the option, satisfying cost under Accumulative lens. No escalation curve beyond that single beat, yet for this length the deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake––will the priest uncover the hidden contract before possession completes––tightens via the ticking watch and multiplying chant, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no renunciation or trade-off narrows Matthias’s options. Pressure crests symbolically rather than through an on-page reversal, keeping cost legible yet abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—write one last prophecy before mind-fracture—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: dawn splits the mirrored horizon, gold bleeding into silver, forcing the final inscription. Yet the escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; exhaustion is threatened but never dramatized as a concrete obstacle that narrows her options mid-scene. The cost is conceptual (her dissolution into light) rather than a choice that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—integration of splintered selves—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each fracture she re-enters. Pressure escalates by density (darkening brightness) rather than causal turns; the final cadence narrows options to "this time, she would be the one." One visible cost: surrender of singular selfhood. Meets quick test for Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“defeat emotional numbness”—signalled in first paragraph; each reversed song tightens the possibility of feeling until the filament “sings,” a meaningful cadence shift. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal: density of somatic vibrations replaces rising external stakes, appropriate to lyric lens. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure coherent. Cost legible on-page at climax; viable for 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect truth vs. personal safety—is signaled by the tailing and tightened when the tube is sealed. One meaningful tightening: the realization that her own data endanger her converts observation into action. Cost is visible—she forfeits the dusk tranquility she cherishes. Could have pushed higher if the ministry’s counter-pressure had been shown on-page rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: comprehend grief-scent link before the last light fades. Escalation is textural: UV frequency narrows options to “see or refuse to see,” then the bloom’s opening forces acknowledgment. Cost is conceptual—once she sees the molecular memories, ignorance is foreclosed; the vial is empty, the scent unrepeatable. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“stay human observer or merge”—is signaled early and tightens once: the rope’s glow signals the invitation is expiring. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient; no extra reversals required. Cost is visible (glow, restarted spiral) but not yet viscerally painful, so the beat stops just short of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—breaking the chronic hush—tightens once when first note returns altered from hull; the final cadence forecloses silence without repairing ruin, price paid in raw sound scraped from grief. Agency is continuous bow-pressure; no coincidence resolves. Could wish for one earlier material loss to sharpen trade-offs, yet cost is legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she withstand the grief she manufactures?—tightens once: the inhale forecloses the option of remaining emotionally untouched. Escalation is causal: because she tests on herself, she must carry the grief forward. Cost is legible in the final sentence (“the work was never finished, only suspended”). No coincidence; pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“attention to invisible threads”—is signaled early; pressure deepens as each artifact (envelope, photo, program) reweights that stake. No reversal, but one meaningful tightening at midnight when she accepts the annotated program, foreclosing her former neutrality with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus depletion—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the arbor shows her past refusal to receive. One meaningful deepening: the spiral tag is revealed as communal practice, not individual artist, which reframes her task from finding to weaving. Cost is visible: she must endure the vulnerability of being helped, foreclosing her old pattern of solitary giving. Agency is internal (decision to stay and ask) but forecloses a path with felt price under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—city’s acoustic heartbeat—escalates as Sera approaches the choke-point chamber; borrowing dream-time tightens options because each stolen fragment risks waking the giant, a visible trade-off that narrows her margin and attaches price to success.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—remain unseen yet useful—tightens when the tape offers a chance to speak: keep it (invisibility intact) or pass it (visibility through proxy). Passing the message forecloses any future claim to authorship, a felt price under the Accumulative lens. Pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each remembered instruction intensifies the obligation to custodianship. One more beat of risk (what if tape is erased by delay?) would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rootedness vs. transplantation—tightens when grant approval paradoxically threatens her stasis. Single deepening beat: releasing the leaf onto the beam externalizes surrender without fixing the conflict. Cost is present (shaking hands, phone-call vulnerability) but not yet irrevocable; escalation plateaus rather than spikes. Enough for high-band, not the visceral pinch that buys 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find meaning or perish—tightens when the telescope becomes the single object that can “snap the horizon into focus,” foreclosing the brooch’s nostalgic comfort. The trade is the one meaningful escalation; no reversals are needed under the Accumulative lens. Cost is tangible: she shivers once the amber warmth is gone. Pressure plateaus after the swap; a second tightening would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the archive remain passive cataloguer or become active voice—emerges once Sera presents the box; pressure tightens when the valve itself finally speaks. Agency is exercised in the last line: clasping the valve forecloses the option of continued silence. The cost is future obligation, felt through the weight in his palm. One meaningful deepening satisfies the lens; no escalation curve, but sufficiency for 800-word window.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme of reassembly versus re-voicing emerges through concrete fragments and the final re-pricing of the silent valve; no statement of thesis. Subtext whispers in “the harbor would speak once more to those who knew how to listen”—a non-literal answer to the exile’s fragmentation. Ambiguity lingers: he may fail to sound the trumpet again, but the possibility is now alive. No echoing of prompt language or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the fortress or remain voiceless”—is signaled early and tightens when the arrows recalculate underfoot, forcing her to risk vocalization. The punch’s warming and the cracks’ steerage create escalating micro-costs that culminate in public self-exposure. One meaningful tightening suffices; agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve intellectual integrity vs. risk absorption into alien memory choir—tightens with each copied symbol. One meaningful deepening: the chain of grandmothers’ faces forces her to decide whether to add her voice. Cost is visible: she permanently trades unemotional documentation for participatory inscription. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he grasp the meaning of transition?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: the mutiny forces the decision to raise the fragment, foreclosing passive waiting. Agency is legible in the deliberate lift; cost is the reality rupture he must now endure. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via intensifying light, warmth, and tears in space; no coincidence is used to resolve. Could edge higher if the text let us feel one sharper personal price (pain, memory loss) during the tearing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether honesty can outmaneuver a rigged asylum system—tightens once: the breach of the door forces Elena to convert private ethic into public action. Agency is visible in the decision to write the new narrative; that act forecloses her anonymity and risks her position. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each paragraph narrows options from observation → complicity → intervention → irreversible commitment. Approval letter arrives off-stage, but the felt price (her father’s method inverted, her workplace violated) is on-page, satisfying cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can the silent town speak again?—is signaled early, but pressure stays ambient; the shifted hum is noted, not contested. No middle beat narrows her options or exacts a price; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. The final image reweights the stake poetically, yet the lack of on-page friction keeps the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—survival of memory against official erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the label is found. One meaningful tightening occurs: the label’s discovery reweights the stakes from vague collection to tangible proof, foreclosing the option of surrender. Pressure grows accumulatively via tidal rhythm and fragment density rather than causal reversals. Cost is present but abstract (continued namelessness); a more visceral price would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve rationalist identity vs. confront unsaid emotional debts. Escalation is textural: each cello hum adds a layer of counter-factual memory, tightening the noose around her certitude. The decisive turn is the third touch—she keeps listening although she already knows no explanation will come. Cost is visible: she forfeits her professional armor and leaves without the explanatory headline she once traveled the world to deliver.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—document irreversible loss—tightens once: the frost will vanish at sunrise. Agency is the deliberate delayed exposure that accepts permanent absence; cost is the vanishing subject itself, legible on the page. No secondary reversal, but the single meaningful deepening satisfies accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“get drone airborne before anchor lifts”—is signaled early and tightens via clock. Pressure escalates texturally: mist thickens, workshop noises multiply, water patterns sharpen. However, no irreversible trade-off or personal cost confronts Elias; success is never jeopardized. The tightening is atmospheric, not agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—prove the mythical convergence—signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each archival scrap, condensation pattern, and now the falcon’s cargo thickens the possibility she is right. No live reversal or narrowing option occurs on the page; the beat is confirmatory, not crucible. Cost is conceptual (years of dismissal) rather than a tactical loss dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—revive the town’s frequency—tightens through the accumulative pattern: each footstep increases sympathetic resonance, narrowing the gap between silence and hum. The visible price is her aching legs and the fork’s warmth; the conceptual price is the irrevocable commitment of 7 000 steps. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cobblestones first buzz back, reweighting the stake from possible folly to imminent awakening. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidences intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—individual survival vs. becoming archival vessel—tightens exactly once when she unscrews the vial, forfeiting air for memory. Escalation is linear, not recursive, but the price (loss of self) is legible and irreversible. No antagonist beyond environment, yet the temple’s pressure feels coherent. Lacks a mid-course complication that could push tension above 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“speak the buried truth before the village learns of the bodies”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Marcus threads the lattice meaning through the door scars, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal, and the reef bodies remain off-stage, blunting visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“awaken scions or debt never ends”—signaled early and tightened when ghost-touch forces silver growth; one visible price: gardener unknowingly accepts lifelong servitude via venom-blood. Under Accumulative lens intensification is a pattern-swell, not reversal; sufficient at this length. No coincidence; escalation coherent; options foreclose.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake is declared in paragraph two: “to see beauty in ruins and purpose in devastation.” Escalation is textured, not plotted: each night’s stitching thickens the luminescent map, narrowing her own exit—she is sewing herself into permanent exile. The decisive intensification arrives when she places the plate against the rock and chooses to sew the spring’s rim, foreclosing any return to the drowned coast. Cost is felt: “orchid solace bloom in her chest” acknowledges the beauty exists because she pays with lifelong displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: recover erased lineage; pressure mounts as each artifact tightens the link between Mira and the gardeners. One meaningful deepening—birthmark on gnomon—forces her stance crystallization; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual: she accepts perpetual custodianship, trading scholarly detachment for ancestral service. Escalation is textural, not causal, but remains coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the power of slow names against instant erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Maren commits the irreversible postscript. The cost is legible: once mailed, the pseudonym can be traced back to her shrine, risking exposure. Pressure could sharpen further if an external antagonistic force (postal inspector, dawn intruder) tested her on-page; as is, the escalation is internal-density driven, acceptable under Accumulative lens but just shy of the visible-price threshold for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—record truth before coup—tightens once: from reading charts to actively stitching “what could be,” foreclosing her invisibility; price is felt in the candle-lit exposure and frost, though no external obstacle confronts her on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—release self-punishment for abandoning sister—tightens once: condensation command → shard warming → self-forgiveness reconfigures cost. Agency is attention/renunciation (she endures memory until letter becomes unnecessary). No coincidence; escalation is emotional density under Accumulative lens. Price is legible: she forfeits the fantasy of revision and accepts permanent loss while reclaiming identity. Sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible by paragraph 2: can Elira translate her own scar tissue into testimony that matters? The meaningful tightening occurs when she deciphers the Wolof—suddenly the adult consolations (“You are brave”) are overwritten by the child’s witness of orange skies and metal-tasting water. Cost is felt: she surrenders the physical archive, forfeiting future re-translation. Agency is interior but decisive; no coincidence rescues or deflates the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she rekindle communal joy without losing her last fragment of ancestral color? Pressure escalates texturally: each luminous layer intensifies stakes until the fresco surrenders its remaining pigment, an irreversible price. No external antagonist; the fog’s memory-logic supplies coherent resistance. One meaningful tightening: the moment she chooses to project through the fragment rather than onto it—foreclosing preservation in favor of shared ephemera.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore vs. co-create—tightens once the coin reweights the acoustics; escalation is textural (density of echoes) rather than causal, but a visible price is paid when she abandons her original certainty, foreclosing the “fill-the-gaps” path.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect unquantified thought—tightens once: from abstract possession of seed to irreversible burial that exposes her to overhead scanner. No second reversal is needed at this length; the single escalation suffices under causal lens. Felt cost is present but compressed into one retrospective sentence; a sharper bodily or temporal price would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will the wait break her?—tightens through density increase: poems become tendrils, roots, blossom armistice, each image raising the cost of continuation. Agency is endurance/attention that forecloses surrender; coincidence absent. The escalation is textural, not causal, but the final image unmistakably reweights the stake. A visible price (accelerated writing in trembling silence) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are the preservation of forgotten names, signaled early and held throughout. Pressure is static: the night’s routine neither tightens nor risks failure; the museum never threatens collapse or loss. One meaningful escalation is missing; the caretaker’s tactics do not adapt. Cost is existential but not dramatized on this beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore collaborative truth after silence—is signaled early. The middle tightening is the act of writing the prophecy: one mis-stroke could shatter trust, a credible point-of-no-return. Cost is present (ink warms, years of credibility on the line), but because the Council or external consequences stay off-page, the escalation feels internal and contained rather than expansive.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—continue father’s dangerous drainage work—tightens once: abstract filial piety converts to concrete commitment when she pockets the chain amid settling stones. Pressure is situational: magma convection cannot be negotiated, only endured and channeled; her agency is to remain rather than retreat. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong exposure to volcanic uncertainty, trading personal safety for communal flood control. No coincidence; escalation is purely the earth’s shifting state forcing her stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she relearn trust after last bird fell silent—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each mapped mote thickens the density of possible meaning until the crystalline playback forces the recognition that trust is daily, not binary. One meaningful tightening: the moment she realizes the songs are preserved yet still vanishing (“beautiful in its impermanence”) forecloses the fantasy of permanent recovery. Price paid: she abandons the hope of final arrival and embraces perpetual sending, a felt on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she cross the sacred threshold—signals on first page and escalates through each decoded pattern. One meaningful tightening: realization that drift is directional collapses curiosity into irrevocable step. Agency is decision, not confrontation; cost is the permanent loss of her old atmospheric intuition. Coincidence (terrace happens to follow flight path) complicates rather than rescues, feeding the sense of fated logic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“how to belong when landscapes shift”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the feather warms beside the archived firefly, forcing Marek’s stance from solitary search to communal witness. No antagonist needed; the sunrise deadline supplies external squeeze. Cost is conceptual: he forsakes exclusive inheritance for shared wonder, legible in the final lines, but the price feels lightly sketched rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—father’s need to know his son’s fate—is signaled at word 70 and tightens when Maren confronts the emotional blackout in the seed trail. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the path “disappeared all at once,” shifting the stakes from recovery to acceptance of transformation. Cost is felt only by the fisher; Maren’s practice incurs no visible price, so escalation remains moderate. Agency is cognitive (conjecture, deeper reach) rather than actionable, appropriate to the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake—prove orchestrated serendipity can still produce wonder—remains abstract; no concrete price (money, reputation, physical risk) is hazarded or foreclosed. Pressure plateaus after the first successful toss; further repetitions accumulate texture but do not tighten options. Escalation is therefore textural, not causal, and the cost felt is only conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: will she surrender the tides forever to write the verse? Pressure escalates through sensory accrual, not external opposition. The tightening is the breath-three-times beat that commits the last tide-dust; option foreclosed. Cost visible as “anchor dissolve,” but secondary stakes (mortal’s fate, ban enforcement) remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—“to illuminate value in the mundane”—stays abstract; no concrete test appears. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: the boat engine starts, day begins, but neither threatens nor sharpens her goal. Without a narrowing option or visible price, escalation remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honor the bargain with loss—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when the box opens to reveal the crazed mirror. One meaningful deepening: the mirror’s fracture forces Mira to see “the person they had made her,” narrowing options from avoidance to vocation. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-memory. Cost is repeatedly paid—Elena’s death, Mira’s tremorless hands, the annual climb—culminating in the vow to carry others’ grief.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—decode hope’s physics—is declared early but never materially tested; no balloon fails catastrophically or forces recalculation, so pressure stays flat. The “parallel timelines” concept abstracts risk off-page; the only felt price is vague “some timelines showed failure,” which does not tighten her present options. One meaningful tightening is required at this length; instead we get iterative sameness.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the building’s dream before it dissolves—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when Ashworth’s partial map passes to Mira. The middle tightening occurs when the half-burned pages force her to improvise with the film negative, narrowing options from “read” to “recover or lose forever.” The price is the recognition that the task is endless; this is legible in the final image of her sketching into darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to reveal living possibilities—tightens as the hush shortens; each bell toll is an audible countdown. Agency is internal yet decisive: she could claim a vision for herself but refuses, narrowing her eternal path to perpetual leaving. Cost is felt in the borrowed heartbeat’s slowing rhythm, a visceral price paid on-page. Escalation is accumulative: each mirror’s ripple layers density until the terrace itself seems to breathe possibility, reweighting her perpetual exile.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can grief be converted into usable truce?—tightens when the name-reading ritual forecloses traditional treaty talk; the handshake is the first live option narrowed. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens: each spoken name adds weight rather than forcing causal reversals. Visible price: Maren abandons the belief that peace honors the dead, accepting endless labor instead. Slight reservation: the external political cost (will the camps actually delay fighting?) is implied rather than shown, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo—signals early and tightens once: the manufactured drought eliminates every rival, forcing her final renunciation. Pressure is situational; no external antagonist, yet options narrow to a single release point. Cost is visible: “she walked away without looking back” forfeits control and certainty. The thunder lull acts as live clock, but the escalation beat is solitary; a second micro-turn could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—remain awake to the lullaby—tightens via each thread she releases; the palace’s song frays “unable to reach her.” Escalation is accumulative: every freed echo increases her own luminosity. The cost is felt—she is now “wild and bright and absolutely… defiant,” a social death inside the palace—satisfying the lens, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—how far to carry a story—signaled early via Mira’s accusation; pressure tightens when Elias chooses to unsay rather than finish, a visible forfeiture of his lifelong craft in front of an audience of none. Accumulative escalation comes through image density (stick / dome / meteor) rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he abandons the story-teller’s authority. No second beat of external resistance keeps it from the 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—safeguard overlooked histories via transient marks—tightens when gust destroys the lattice, forcing improvisation that risks total failure. One meaningful deepening: from cataloguing stasis to active interruption of migration disaster. Cost is the broken lattice itself and the future labor of rebuilding; price is legible, though secondary moral stakes (species extinction vs. human memory) remain more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will she resume her custodial duty?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the rope’s fragility threatens to snap under her touch, foreclosing the option to remain passive. The punched card scrap provides the single deepening that converts guilt into tactic; no coincidence required. Cost is viscerally paid: numb fingers, aching joints, and the permanent loss of her protective silence once the rope begins to “breathe.” One minor slack: the middle third could use one additional micro-tightening beat to push her closer to physical failure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—“reach the threshold before the directive decays”—tightens through storm countdown and seal luminosity; the flip from protocol to answered questions is a meaningful deepening. Yet the price is purely conceptual; no lived resource is forfeited, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—palace survival—tightens when schematic use proves the forgotten covenant is real. Single meaningful deepening: the tile is not curio but key, narrowing options to “speak or let city fall.” Agency is endurance/silence at dawn, a visible forfeiture of acclaim. Cost is legible: eternal secrecy, felt in the smile he never shares.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 3: resurrect the melody or lose reality. Pressure tightens once—Kael’s admission of “Yes… For always” forecloses denial and forces the grace-conservation transfer. Cost is felt: Kael’s translucent flesh firms only after he pays the emotional price; Mira risks permanent estrangement by refusing coercion. Under causal lens the escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—will the mirror hold the runaway dream?—is signaled early and tightens once as glass and breath synchronize, but the beat is narrated summary, not an on-page fork that forecloses an option; pressure accumulates lyrically rather than causally. Cost is conceptual (erasure of boundary) rather than a tangible forfeiture felt by Mira in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she mend the shattered quartz eye and the broken promise—tightens once: the recognition that tools alone fail forces the shift from craft to offering. Pressure accumulates through decaying pears and failing light; the final gesture forecloses further repair work and accepts relational cost. No false escalation; coincidence is absent. The price (daughter’s absence, pride’s limits) is legible, but the beat could carry one more visceral loss to hit 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“will she complete the inheritance?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the cameo arrives. The single meaningful escalation is her decision to voice the forbidden question; this irrevocably narrows her status from caretaker to knower and produces the visible cost (loss of bewilderment). Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve. One beat suffices at this length; the tightening is meaningful and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recover the library of unlearned lessons—arrives early, but pressure plateaus: Elara observes, reflects, translates, yet faces no concrete obstacle or ticking clock. The time traveler’s failure is backstory, not present opposition; empty shelves symbolize danger but impose no active cost. Escalation is textural (deeper descent, narrower passage) rather than tactical; options don’t visibly narrow. Agency is cerebral, not transactional, so the requisite “felt price” remains abstract, capping tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the garden of forgotten names to “recapture something”—is declared early but never tested; no tangible cost or narrowing of options occurs. The single micro-turn is the voice growing “clearer,” yet this intensifies atmosphere, not pressure. Because agency stops at pressing the card to her chest, escalation is poetic rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—locate usable silence—tightens once: spiral pattern proves null-point exists, Mira’s tone + stone catalyzes it, foreclosing future use of her trained voice (cost implicit in “ancient purpose fulfilled”). Pressure is coherent, single deepening sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can shattered wonder reignite communal navigation?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: prism discovery re-opens a possibility long abandoned. No reversal, but a deepening under Accumulative lens suffices at this length. Cost is conceptual (she must shoulder ancestral voices) rather than visceral; hence ceiling at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—witnessing versus shaping identity—announced early but never tightens. No reversal or trade-off occurs; shadow angle delivers confirmation, not crisis. Pressure stays ambient; storm is spectacle, not test. Closure is resonance, not escalation, so cost is conceptual, not viscerally foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—re-light the sky or accept collective despair—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when she decides to burn the non-replaceable rag. The escalation is single but meaningful: discovery of the dare → realization she must spend the heirloom → spiral ignition. Cost is legible: the rag can never be retied; village silence is broken, exposing her to unknown reception. Could edge higher if the story let us feel the physical risk of a botched burn inside those stone walls.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: can observation-without-words bridge the three-year silence? Escalation is textural—each tidal metaphor thickens the unsaid until cicada placement forces a stance crystallization; sister’s softer voice confirms narrowing options. No external antagonist needed; risk of permanent estrangement is felt. Cost is conceptual—the acceptance of partial, tidal return rather than full flood—legible in final “turning” line.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—collect flavors of different silences—tightens when the gilded hush proves incompatible with bunker life; the hourglass of inverted gravity supplies escalating pressure. Agency: she actively places the doll beside the sprout, a micro-turn that accepts exposure as growth medium. Cost is legible: she must descend back to the bunker tonight, carrying a silence her father will never understand. Could edge higher if the sprout faced an immediate threat that forced a riskier choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can silence be taught to comfort before the route ends? Pressure tightens when the glass violet-shifts; Maren’s agency—extending trajectory, uncorking, humming—narrows the option of passive transit. The escalating cost is the stolen minutes and the emotional trespass; the final crystalline clarity is the irreversible reconfiguration. Under the Accumulative lens, each sensory layer (light, vapor, echo) intensifies the same stake rather than pivoting to new conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“earn custodianship or lose the window”—is signalled early and tightens once: murals reveal she must surrender certainties step by step. Sunrise clock supplies visible price; failure equals entrapment between worlds. Because she meets no intermediate test, pressure jumps straight to the final peel; still, the dawn deadline forces the ultimate palm-press choice with felt forfeiture of her old identity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—breath vs. isolation—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the apparition dramatizes suffocation inside the same sanctuary once deemed safe. The keeper’s agency drives the single reversal: she chooses to maintain the threshold rather than let it vanish, stepping out. Cost is legible—loss of hermetic peace, exposure to the world. No external coincidence; pressure is purely situational and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will she trust a promise again?”—is signaled early and tightened at the bolt-glow beat where refusal becomes impossible. Protagonist agency is present (drives to farm, speaks text, holds bolt), and the price is witnessing her own trauma, an irreversible reframing. No external antagonist needed; pressure stays internal-coherent. Escalation is single-arc rather than layered, adequate for 750 wds but not richly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single stake—reject or accept the Morrow legacy—tightens the instant the crank is grasped. Agency is present but solitary; no live opposition escalates risk after the lawyer trigger. The tightening is conceptual rather than physical, sufficient for the length but lacking a palpable price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“can possibility be re-inhabited?”—is clear, and the single deepening (reading the vow aloud) tightens the spell, forcing Aldric to animate the puppets. Escalation is gentle, accumulative; no visible price is extracted from Aldric during the dance itself, so pressure feels aesthetic rather than endangering.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: whether to intervene in histories or merely preserve them. Button discovery supplies single deepening that reweights stakes—documentation becomes moral act. No antagonist; pressure is internal and systemic. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; cost legible in her acceptance of perpetual secondary role.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preservation of suppressed truth vs. regime erasure—signaled in paragraph 1 and escalated by audit exposure; the puddle-map discovery is the single meaningful turn that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: once she lifts the stone slab, return to invisibility is impossible. Escalation is linear, not deepened by secondary reversal, but sufficient at this length. Agency is hers; luck complicates (audit) but does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: keep prophecy silent.  Single tightening when the first syllable almost surfaces; he counters with three staccato blasts that foreclose that breach.  Cost is legible—his exhaustion, the thickened mist—but no new constraint persists into tomorrow except the same cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode leaf, save future harvest—is signaled in paragraph one. Single meaningful tightening: prophecy of drought + forgotten seed narrows her mission to one salvific act. Agency is present (she descends, pries jar, claims seed), but the escalation is informational rather than obstacle-laden; no live option is foreclosed on-page. Cost is conceptual (impending change) not a visible loss or trade-off, so pressure intensifies knowledge, not consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (recover compass → recover Elias) is signaled early; pressure is one-directional descent. No active opposition or trade-off surfaces in-scene; danger is only atmospheric. The beat advances location, not jeopardy. Sufficient for a 6-plus, but no tightening/ narrowing of options keeps it from 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she dare the transmutation her brother died for?—is signaled early. One tightening: choosing kintsugi over solder irrevocably commits her to his risk-path; the glowing seams manifest the price on-page. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt vs. fear of error supplies sufficient pressure under causal lens. Cost is visible (the coin’s pulse now her pulse), though second-beat complication is thin, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can this soul laugh before dissolution—tightens when the discordant chord risks failure; success forecloses her chance to rest. One meaningful escalation: the first-ever specter-smile proves her method works, raising the emotional ante for every future soul. Cost is visible: the soldier’s release re-opens her own “familiar ache.” No reversal for Mira this round, but pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she keep or drop the beacon?—tightens once: the strap’s hum rises, options narrow to enter the clearing. Pressure is situational yet coherent; agency is endurance/attention, not reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—inherit or refuse the Keeper’s relay—surfaces by paragraph 3. Escalation is accretive: each stall vignette thickens the intuition beam until the painting forces the single renunciation-of-ignorance. Cost is felt when the protagonist “unfastened the clasp… let the fragment hang free,” foreclosing ordinary anonymity. One tightening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs. psychic cost—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: ceiling cracks resolve into hidden hatch, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural/accumulative: dust, spring, echo converge to force stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of burden) rather than visceral, keeping it below 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can a compressed eternity be responsibly released?—is signaled early via the frost-syntax. Pressure tightens once the bottle is in-hand: the press offers one irreversible path, foreclosing safe containment. The rupture’s expansion is irreversible and legibly costly (shattered frost, sweating shelves), satisfying the 8+ band. However, Elara’s agency is largely receptive—she reads, carries, lowers the bar—so the escalation feels orchestrated by the world rather than forced by her trade-offs, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: whether to let the past overwrite the present during the storm. Tightening occurs when she uncovers the final mirror, risking temporal dissonance to glimpse founders’ desperation—option narrows to “look and go mad” or “cover and preserve multiplicity.” Agency drives escalation: she invents, implements, and personally tests the mirror method. Cost is legible—she chooses custodial loneliness over revolutionary certainty—but price could be sharper if the storm scarred her sensory perception on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim light stolen by midnight—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: last silver wire connection narrows options to now-or-never. Cost is conceptual (lifetime spent) but not viscerally fresh on the page; price is retrospective summary. Escalation is textural accumulation of light particles; under Accumulative lens this suffices, yet pressure never spikes—remains steady lament.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the ultimate petrichor—is signaled early and tightens once: the lagoon offers nothing to bottle, forcing renunciation. The single deepening under Accumulative lens is decisive; options narrow from trade to silence, price is the forfeiture of her life’s work, felt on-page. No reversals needed; the coherent pressure of scentless completion is sufficient. Cost is visible and scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“how to shape debris into lineage”—is signaled early and deepens through one intensification: the slide reveals she already belongs to a chain of makers. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the narrowing feels irreversible: she must now carve as reply, not self-expression. Cost is legible in the single, monumental arm she begins, trading manageable sculptures for an unfinishable gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—need to grasp why flowers bloom unseen—tightens once: the glass map reconfigures her quest from curiosity to stewardship. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of hidden beauty) rather than visceral; no tool, time, or social price is visibly forfeit, keeping the score below 8.5. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens but leans on epiphany more than compressed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—“will Miriam accept the parley witness role?”—is latent until the final paragraph; no intermediate obstacle or cost tests her readiness. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: static zeppelin, windless lagoon, calm apparition. The single micro-turn is the grandmother rising, but it complicates nothing; it delivers. Pressure stays thematic (burden of memory) rather than visceral or tactical, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens but only lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can memory alone birth a living culture?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each artisan memory thickens possibility until the cove materially reconfigures. Protagonist agency is continuous—he kneels, pours, rejects comfort, smiles—no coincidence resolves the tension. Cost is visible in his centuries of self-denial and in the final line: he will now teach them “to live without magic,” forfeiting the easy wish-route forever.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—hearing the promised oath—tightens when silence becomes mandatory; the only option left is receptivity. One decisive intensification: pressing wax to temple forecloses passive nostalgia and opens floodgate of dead voices; price is lifelong vigilance. Agency is attention-based rather than action-heavy—appropriate to lens but softens visible cost compared to physical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the ritual succeed without her mentor?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each sensory notch: temperature drops, starlight intensifies, entropy must reverse inside her body. The protagonist’s agency is absolute: she alone channels ancestral quietude, kneels, opens, and pays the price of becoming temporal conduit. Cost is visible—“the vortex sealed itself around the seedling” forever fuses her lifeline to this hybrid child. A hair more external jeopardy (even a cracked pane or cracking voice) would have pushed this into 8.8+ terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the network warn in time?”—tightens through rising telemetry; agency remains diagnostic, not dilemma-driven. Escalation is atmospheric, not personal; no option is foreclosed for Elara, so the cost registers socially, not individually.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: witnessing vs. intervening with the fragment. A single deepening—kneeling to trace instead of scoop—narrows options and pays visible reverence as cost. No external opposition or reversal, but under an accumulative lens the pressure coheres through intensified stillness and the stakes feel proportionate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“someone must remember”—is signaled early and tightens once when the ghost gestures toward the dig site. The tightening is single but meaningful: refusal to leave becomes binding covenant. Cost is conceptual yet legible in the box’s weight. Could use one intermediate beat of resistance to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“understand the texture of time”—is clear early; pressure tightens once when she writes a final listing and comprehension “settles into her chest.” Yet the tightening is delivered as summary, not a choice that forecloses an option; cost is conceptual, not visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can anything broken still gesture toward flight?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the poet confronts the missing string. Escalation is textural: each attempt to mend (feather-to-kite, paper-to-frame) increases the density of incompleteness until the missing string crystallizes the irreversible limit. Agency remains the poet’s; the decision to stop mending and pocket the feather is active renunciation that forecloses perfect flight. Cost is visible—kite will never rise—but could be sharper if the poet’s body registered the loss (tremor, exhale) at the exact beat of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finish the remodel before death—is signaled early; pressure tightens when weakness fuzzes her grip on the ladder, a micro-turn that costs steadiness. No reversal follows; instead, the wire keeps winding, accumulating density under Accumulative lens. Cost is present but incremental (stamina, time) rather than a foreclosed option; the escalation plateaus just below the 8.8 gate. Still, agency remains hers, and the stakes stay viscerally tethered to the wire in hand.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is declared early and carried by reflection, not mounting external pressure. No beat narrows Elena’s options or risks anything tangible; tension is existential. The single “turn” is purely internal recognition while holding amber, operating under Accumulative/Textural lens. Because no felt price is exacted on the page, escalation stays modest; closure cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can memory out-argue extinction?”—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is Accumulative: each seeded pod thickens the submerged concord until the pattern breaks surface. The birds’ hush and green thread provide the single meaningful tightening. Cost is conceptual (last ferryman spends final currency of knowledge) rather than tangible, keeping pressure legible but not viscerally acute; still sufficient for this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—recover brother’s voice—lands early and tightens through each shard; the meaningful turn is the shift from auditory to tactile reading, which forecloses every prior attempt and forces the final revelation. Cost is present but conceptual (acceptance of illusion), lacking a tangible forfeiture such as broken equipment or lost time, so escalation stays solid rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightened when the glimpse forces her to redraw the sky. The cost is visible: she forfeits the old certitude of “true north” as location and embraces perpetual navigation. Agency is interior yet forecloses return to pre-shutdown innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—moral repair—signals early; the single tightening beat is Seraph’s revelation that re-casts the gift as recycled contraband, forcing Caelius to own an even larger theft. Cost is conceptual (fresh shame) but still off-loaded onto Seraph; a visible personal price would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: will she release or preserve the sister’s name? Pressure tightens once—from spelling the name to spelling “beginning,” a single deepening that forecloses archival fixation. Cost is the audible absence that answers back. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—remembering without fear—is signaled early and tightens once when she plants the seed-question; the stone’s glow forecloses refusal. Cost is legible: pain of memory floods back immediately. Escalation is single-point but sufficient for 600-word scope. No reversal, yet the deepening reweights options under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (visions still substitute reality) shapes the exit decision.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs. public condemnation—tightens via the accumulating frozen tableaux that refuse her absolution. The single meaningful escalation is the discovery that the tapestry records her disgrace; decoding it becomes the decisive act that restarts time. Agency is pure attention and renunciation; cost is the realization that she alone kept herself frozen. Stakes would prickle more if the village’s thaw carried social risk (will they blame her?), but the internal pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the ritual erase truth again?—tightens when each child repeats a poem, incrementally foreclosing the priests’ option to silence. Agency is pure: Sera chooses to refract rather than shout, paying with her last chance to reclaim her own surrendered memories. One meaningful intensification: the canyon’s hush flips from oppressive to amplifying. Cost is felt in the spire’s impotent pulse and the irreversible scattering of her words.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before obliteration—tightens via the literal breath-count clock. Each matched scar is an accumulative beat that deepens the cost of failure; the final breath crystallizes stance without external rescue. Escalation is textural, not causal, appropriate to the lyric lens. Visible price: she trades certainty for continuation, tasted on the charm, felt in the sea’s retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“find the why of painting again”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through accumulative wandering and the shell’s impossible reappearance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pool reflection reveals the memory-image, forcing the choice to relinquish the painted shell. The cost is conceptual (ownership illusion abandoned) rather than viscerally felt; a tactile consequence (shiver, tear, audible exhale) would sharpen 8+. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can whispers reach farther than shouts?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Mira forsakes audible prayer for silent vibration; the Cost Proof Test is satisfied by the ships’ visible turn within the hour. One meaningful escalation under causal lens: thermal chaos → jasmine cut → intent purified → beacon retooled → sailors saved. Price is conceptual but legible: Mira crosses a threshold she can’t uncross, as the logbook will now expect whisper-miracles.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore emotional connection via forbidden science—is signaled early and tightens when she secretes the eye with outlawed texts, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is situational: landscape violence mirrors social danger, forcing stance crystallization. No causal antagonist, but patrol dismissal shows stakes. Cost is conceptual (outlaw status) yet legible; could be sharper if patrol threat re-entered at end.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture or live with permanent ambiguity—is signaled in paragraph two. Mid-story discovery of hidden address/note supplies the single meaningful tightening: mystery shifts from impenetrable to actionable, forcing a choice. Cost is felt in the remembered abandonment that resurfacing will reopen. No escalation after that midpoint, but under lyrical-accumulative lens the density of meaning (not event) intensifies sufficiently; additional external complications would have over-stuffed 741-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reach the doorway before the flood—signals early and tightens once, when water audibly shifts from warning to ankle-deep constraint. Agency is present: she chooses to insert the chip and cross, paying the immediate price of no return. Pressure is strictly situational, not multi-reversal, appropriate to 700-word scope. Cost is legible on the page (“the creek rose around her”), meeting the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim purpose or remain hollow—gains pressure as the mountain’s wound mirrors her own. The tightening occurs when she realizes the summons is not threat but obligation; however, escalation is textural rather than causal, relying on image density rather than a visible option being foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing “density of presence”—is signaled early; pressure mounts through accumulative returns rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the shift from extraction to acknowledgment forecloses prior methodology with visible conceptual cost; price is legible but not yet viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: the fight against dissolution of self across timelines. Escalation is textural: each paragraph thickens the chronotopic soup—moss growing in fast-forward, birdsong rewinding, colors unseen in waking light. Jealousy of his own past self is the visible price that forces surrender. One meaningful tightening: acceptance that the grave is a waypoint, not an ending.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she regain a way to “sense” clients—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: fog lifts, screw emerges, attention crystallizes; one meaningful deepening suffices. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure tightens when object re-prices her vocation. Cost is legible in the warmed screw and her renunciation of smell-centric identity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she inscribe truth before the storm breaks—tightens with each raindrop. Agency is inscription or surrender; the crystal trait raises physical stakes as skin gems could jam the quill. One meaningful deepening: realization that scars are ink waiting, not shame. Cost is paid on-page when rain dissolves the crystals, forcing her to write with liquid grief rather than hide it.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—deliver apology before chainsaws—tightens when the current flickers and the apology becomes the last possible act; the cost (permanent disconnect) is legible in Margot’s dissolve and the falling tree.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    No stake is signaled early; “unravel cosmic illusions” stays abstract and never sharpens into a concrete risk or forfeiture. Pressure is flat—description accumulates, but options do not narrow and no price is paid. The protagonist’s ritual walk has no obstacle, resistance, or trade-off, so escalation is absent. Without a tightening that costs Elara anything, conflict remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are existential patience: will tonight reward her credo that clocks track “change itself”? Pressure tightens only atmospherically—wind, silence, razor horizon—never through an active threat or trade-off. The single micro-turn is the simultaneous arrival of critical water level and first light; it confirms rather than tests her stance, so escalation is observational, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (lifelong solitude) but not dramatized as a fresh forfeiture within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can intimacy survive without disclosure? Pressure accumulates through luminous pulses and withheld syllables until the single spoken sentence tightens every prior silence into audible cost. No reversals are needed; the escalation is a deepening of density—three years of quiet folding into one cracked word. The price is visceral: the utterance dissolves the very architecture that sustained their connection.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—will she confess understanding to her father—signals early but pressure stays interior; no external obstacle tightens after the subway photos. Escalation is a single mood shift inside the hospital room; cost is conceptual (abandoning the safety of “careful rebellion”) yet not dramatized as a forfeiture we can see. Sufficient for micro-length, but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: witnessing strangers’ endings without ever stepping through her own doorway—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each wrong-number call layers unspent grief; the harmonica’s rising note is the tightening cadence, not a causal turn. No visible price paid on-page—she absorbs but never forfeits—so cost is conceptual, felt in the final suspended ring. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a moment where her endurance forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments—signals early; single tightening occurs when she accepts breathing change rather than freezing it, narrowing future method. Escalation is textural density, not rising external threat; cost is conceptual, visible in promise phrasing. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but barely crosses 7-band without sharper tactical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—escape versus connection—tightens once: the trade rule forces a public, stationary vulnerability that forecloses anonymous exit. Cost is social/ existential rather than physical, but unmistakable on-page. No escalation reversals beyond the single rule, yet that suffices for 600-word scope under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find the stillpoint—signaled early; pressure escalates via musical interval drops that materialize sorrow underfoot, narrowing her path to a single held breath; absence of external antagonist is replaced by rising internal stakes, cost legible in the final weeping stand that ends the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from noise—tightens when the folded signal resists standard isolation; her contingent method is the only path left, narrowing options. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each failed protocol raises the cost of trusting her dismissed technique. The final recognition that the signal is a response reweights the stake; the price is the years already lost and the future spent listening at the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—revive Mira’s dream via neural entanglement—tightens when Elara risks amplified feedback to drum the forbidden pattern; garden’s response forecloses secrecy and exposes her to tomorrow’s data probe, a felt price. Single meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens. Escalation is coherent, though secondary physical risk (vomiting) remains static rather than worsening.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“whispers vs. official channels”—is signaled in the first third and tightened when the radio dies for good. One meaningful deepening: Reyes appears on the catwalk to concede, proving the whispers’ efficacy and foreclosing his authority claim. Cost is legible: Mira’s perpetual return to the maze, coin warming like inherited duty. No secondary reversal, but the single turn is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is declared early but never tested against opposition; no scene shows Eleanor facing reprimand, discovery, or self-doubt. Pressure is static: each paragraph restates the same quiet diffusion. Because escalation is purely accretive summary, the reader feels no narrowing of options or rising cost. The rebellion succeeds without friction, so tension plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unlock her own heart—tightens once: the whale’s second call forces the choice between talisman-as-shield and self-immersion. Escalation is situational but coherent: external invitation, internal refusal, then surrender; no coincidence resolves. Felt price is the forfeiture of the scrimshaw and the literal risk of hypothermia/drowning, crystallized as she swims toward “black water.” One beat could sharpen stakes further—an explicit memory of punishment for water-contact—but the current pressure suffices for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether she can preserve an unmandated interior life—signals early and tightens through each narrated mundane task that risks drone detection. One meaningful deepening: the bouquet’s illegal presence → hidden chest → wooden replica escalates penalty if discovered, visible cost in the time spent carving while turbines keep watching. Agency is incremental renunciation: she keeps giving herself away (voice, time, knife edge) to buy the right to remain blank. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but Accumulative lens legitimizes it; price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are perceptual liberation; pressure tightens via cumulative lyrical dissolution rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes walls were mental constructs. No visible price is exacted—crossing costs neither sweat nor sacrifice—so escalation feels tonal rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can a fake pilgrimage feel real?—is signaled early and tightens once: the committee doubt becomes her private fear that “texture” might be impossible to blueprint. The deepening is purely internal; no external test, deadline, or resource forfeiture narrows options, so escalation is cerebral rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can grief bloom again?—is signaled early and tightened when the pendant is accepted, foreclosing permanent despair. Escalation is textural: each origami bird increases density of possible paths, narrowing to the single invitation. Agency is Elara’s offer/illumination, not the woman’s, so the cost feels slightly off-loaded. Still, the withered flower inside crystal makes the price visceral and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Soren’s need to locate the exact failure point—tightens when the twelve-foot pull makes that quest visibly impossible. Escalation is accretive: each card laid down adds density, not reversal, until the branching pattern forces the confession “I helped build it.” Cost is felt: the tape’s twelve feet become the literal span of his delusion, a distance he must now walk back through rain. No option is magically solved; hope is the only narrowed path left, and it is taken under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator seize or release the atoms—tightens when the dance forces surrender; escalation is textural (density of motes) rather than causal reversal. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible as self-dissolution. No external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—is declared early and tightens through the discovery that hope is becoming “more abstract but also more radiant.” The single meaningful deepening occurs when she confronts the child/mother dissolution footage again; repetition accumulates rather than reverses, forcing her stance to crystallize into permanent vigil. Price is conceptual (endless archive, stone’s warmth) but not viscerally felt on-page; no live option is foreclosed, limiting escalation bandwidth. Still, under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Mara retain compassion without self-erasure—tightens with each scale she affixes, the only on-page test. Escalation is accumulative: pattern of loss-and-repair intensifies until starlight reweights meaning. No external reversals required; the single deepening suffices. Cost is visible in the forever-scarred tail and her acceptance of perpetual imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“open wounds to close them”—is signaled in grandmother’s note and escalates as each artifact (hourglass, coffee rings, prints) forces Maya to trade denial for memory. One meaningful tightening: pressing scarred palms to brother’s prints forecloses escape and crystallizes cost. Pressure is accumulative/textural rather than adversarial, fitting the lens. Could use a slightly sharper external risk beat to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens through visionary accretion rather than external opposition; each recovered image narrows the option of ever removing the love. Agency is cognitive/ethical: the decision not to extract the film is the single narrowing turn, paid for with the tears she wipes away. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is whether knowledge entitles theft. Cost is visible and conceptual: she forecloses her own mission, embracing perpetual custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled in paragraph 2. One tightening: her shift from frantic “hunt” to still “listening” narrows options and escalates internal pressure. Cost is legible—she must abandon the identity of striving artist. External coincidence (meteor) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—protect cargo vs. temptation to sell—is signaled early and tightened once in the merchant beat; refusal narrows her future options without violence, visible conceptual cost. Pressure is accumulative: the archive’s weight and the clock’s frozen moment deepen rather than escalate through causal turns, fitting the chosen lens. No reversal beyond the single refusal, which is sufficient at this length. Stakes stay personal and legible; world-destruction remains backdrop rather than telescopic inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—reconcile externalized mind-jungle—are declared early. Pressure escalates texturally: vines thicken, rust accumulates, melody darkens. Yet Cyrus never confronts an irreversible trade-off; the tangle parts once the gear is merely placed. Escalation is atmospheric, not agentive, keeping tension vivid but below the 8-band threshold where cost visibly forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim unused courage—signaled in paragraph one and sharpened by each loop of the indirect path. Escalation is textural: twilight deepens, leash frays further, heartbeat grows louder, options narrow to three paths. One meaningful tightening when leash slips away—safety option literally falls into void. Cost legible in bodily wear and irrevocable abandonment of vigil; could use one earlier tactical loss (time, breath) to push into 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—tightens once: the bronze trail forces Marcus to admit safety = complicity. No reversals are needed under the accumulative lens; the single deepening beat lands with felt cost (bolt pocketed, path chosen). Pressure is coherent, personal, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—expose pretender—declared early and never wavers. Pressure deepens via density: each added annotation thickens the latent accusation, reweighting the stakes under Accumulative lens. No visible price is extracted from Threnody herself, only deferred triumph, so cost is conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for 8.0 band but not higher. One meaningful tightening suffices and occurs when constellation pause signals the trap is now irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—the rebellion’s future—tightens once: from lull-as-paralysis to lull-as-breath. The circle’s rising hum externalizes escalating pressure; Kira’s agency crystallizes in the kneel/stand pivot that forecloses passive mourning. Cost is felt (she shoulders her father’s legacy), though no tangible resource is forfeited on-page, keeping it just below the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break or keep the ancestral seal—announced when Anya labels reburying “implanted destinies.” Middle beat: plants scream, Yara realizes the kite is a map; this tightening forecloses neutrality. Final hand-clasp embodies the trade-off: safety of silence vs. responsibility to evolve. Cost is legible—once chamber opens, secrecy can never be restored; volcanic landscape already proved consequences of ignored warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake = permission to remain un-healed while still cultivating life. Pressure escalates through accretion: four years of failed cereus buds → one bloom that forces the question: is this enough? The tightening is soft but unmistakable—each failed bloom subtracts hope; the success reweights it. Cost is visible: she stays alone, photo faces still melted, hands scarred by soil.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether she can ever see/ paint a true face—surfaces early and tightens through pattern intensification: each card refracts faces until the perception itself threatens to collapse. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she flips fragmentation from curse to gift, foreclosing the old portrait method with visible conceptual cost. No antagonist or external opposition, so pressure is purely cognitive; still, the escalating luminosity of thread-loosening acts as accumulative agency. Cost is legible on-page (“the broken tarot box rested complete”), meeting the 8.8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—discover why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and deepens when ink begins to glow, tightening from observation to participatory dissolution. One meaningful shift: observer becomes subject, foreclosing escape. Cost is legible in bodily fade; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Could use a mid-scene tactical loss (tool, stamina) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs reveal—tightens when the letter’s contraband truth cracks her mythology. Escalation is causal: reading → internal rupture → transmission. Cost is legible: the quiet transforms, networks sing, she forfeits her custodial identity. A sharper external jeopardy hint would lift higher.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—tending continuity against collapse—is signaled early and deepened when refugees arrive, forcing Mira to test her pacifist stance. One meaningful tightening occurs: offering water commits her finite resources, narrowing future options. Cost is visible in the final paragraph’s assertion that beauty persists “even when everything else crumbled.” Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens, but no second reversal keeps it from the 8+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“catch the echo before it scatters”—signaled early; each spiral turn tightens pattern density, narrowing options from sight to silence. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: the spike’s increasing weight with grief and the final trade of lifelong perceptual habit for god-echo. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; tightening legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—break the family’s complicity cycle—is signaled on page 1. Escalation occurs through cognitive tightening: each generational betrayal tightens the possible interpretations of her own actions until the contradiction falsifies guilt and forces a new offensive stance. No coincidence resolves; the journalist’s accusation complicates rather than saves. Felt cost: she loses the refuge of plausible denial and must confront an internal saboteur. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—silence the guilt-echo—signaled on entry; escalation is one tightening beat: hearing the sister’s coordinates forecloses retreat. Price is implicit but legible: risking paradox/self-erasure by stepping into the looping cradle-scene. Agency is continuous; no external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn to speak when art feels like lying”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as chalk patterns must die to create hush. Inserting the tile is the single decisive agency that forecloses her old permanence stance; cost is the tile’s warmth and the irrevocable scattering of the mandala. Under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices for escalation; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible on page, satisfying 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory versus surrender to erasure—tightens when the mosaic patterns “converge” under her thumb, forcing the transfer decision. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the looping past itself. One visible price: she forfeits the name’s protective iron to the boy, remaining alone with her visions. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for lyric flash; coincidence (the bell) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can despair be converted into possibility? Pressure intensifies when echoes force Mira to witness branching futures; tightening beat is her reaching the coin. Agency is shared: Elara initiates, Mira accepts; both pay—Elara forfeits tether, Mira forfeits certainty of failure. Cost is legible on-page: spectral relief and tear-stained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—how to re-establish consensual connection after the pill recall—tightens when the geode offers an alternative path. The single deepening occurs at the temple-press beat: she trades isolation for permeability, and the cost (loss of prior protective skepticism) is legible on the page. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the lyric mode; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—map the emotional residue before settlement encroachment—tightens when the elm leaf signals a pre-human conversation she must now voice. One meaningful deepening occurs in the tidal pool, but the escalation is interior; the price is insight rather than a lost option, so pressure peaks intellectually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are intellectual: will her button-archive be deemed trivial? Pressure tightens once the canyon echo threatens to confirm that fear, then deepens when the pattern she unscrambles reframes prophecy itself. The tightening is single but meaningful—her taxonomy shifts from antiquarian to world-shaping. Because she never risks loss of position or voice, the cost is conceptual, not visceral, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—expose internal rot or perish—signaled early; escalation occurs through the decoded snow signals and the exposed meeting, each sharpening risk. Protagonist agency drives the final transfer; no coincidences resolve. One meaningful tightening suffices: open-air hand-off forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—distill life to essence—signaled early, but pressure is ambient, not causal: no external complication or rising risk narrows his options. Escalation is a slow accretion of memory; the only “turn” is the barge arrival, which merely permits what he already decided. No visible price or option lost on the page keeps this below the 7-line.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“can bereaved hope be rekindled?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened when Maren risks her sole relic to engage the girl. One meaningful tightening: the gauge leaves Maren’s palm, foreclosing solitary consolation and forcing communal ritual. Cost is legible: talisman surrendered, emotional armor lowered, winter still coming. Under Accumulative lens the hush/oar pattern intensifies until the planting beat crystallizes the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into generative connection—tightens when the unknown atlas surfaces; the tide’s literal lift mirrors her emotional lift, forcing the choice to midwive future species. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual haunted memory (“chorus…singing not in mourning but in welcome”), a felt price under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Mira convert her hidden archive into public meaning? Pressure tightens once: the storm-displaced nest gives her the form that will expose the letters. No reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; the pattern break (private → public) is sufficient. Cost is conceptual—her secrecy surrendered—and is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim student agency from hidden manipulation—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: dawn deadline forces her to risk frying the ancient array. Cost is visible: stiff muscles, cold cup, station groan. Escalation is linear, not multi-turn, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key or surrender to earth’s forgetting—is signaled early and tightened when the organ’s dirge halts her advance, forcing a choice: retreat or claim inheritance. The tightening costs her residual innocence; she exits knowing future descents are now obligatory, not optional. One clear escalation suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is reviving family empathy, signaled early; pressure intensifies as ribbon residue must be “felt” into visibility. One deepening: shift from seeking bones to painting emotion narrows options and crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible—she assumes perpetual custodianship of others’ grief. Lacks external resistance or possible failure, keeping it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore ancestor’s legacy vs. institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightens when decoded stanzas prove the cover-up. One meaningful deepening: realisation that jet-stream disaster could have been mitigated raises personal cost to global scale. Agency is legible in the decision to confront, with persistent constraint that publication is blocked; cost is acknowledgment of career suicide. No on-page antagonist weakens tangible pressure, but internal stakes carry the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to witness disappearance without being hollowed by it—tightens when the hitchhiker steps into darkness, leaving the fiddler literal and metaphysical cargo. Escalation is atmospheric, not plot-rivalrous: each new bridge gig retroactively deepens the cost of bearing testimony. The glass fragment’s apparition is the single, irrevocable price, forcing her into perpetual recounting. Agency is reactive (accept the vision) yet irrevocable, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save the team’s autonomy—signalled in first 90 words. Tightening beat: Elena’s buy-out offer → Marcus’s territorial counter-argument → joint renunciation. Price visible: they forgo immediate payout (“enough to start over. Clean”). Agency is persuasive, not coercive; coincidence absent. Internal/external stakes interlock: identity as founders vs. paternal legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—shared burden versus solitary mastery—is signaled early and tightens when Maren’s telegram forces dissemination of knowledge. Escalation is accretive: each recalled dream layer adds weight until silence becomes untenable; no reversal, but deepening suffices. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—perpetual responsibility accepted—but still legible. A sharper external risk (funding loss, temple collapse) would have nudged tension higher.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is reversal of magical failure; pressure escalates via the widening circles that crack the dome—one tightening mechanic, legible cost (his aging reflection, the eaten flesh-residue). No antagonist needed; coincidence only complicates. The turn is his alone, foreclosing the path of eternal shame. Missing only a sharper material price on his body to enter 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stake—become the bridge—tightens once: accepting the covenant compresses her identity from observer to portal; the cost is rendered as “piercing illumination,” a felt burn that reweights her existence, satisfying the single deepening required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover sister’s spirit—announced early; pressure tightens once as golden fruit reveals transference price, foreclosing resurrection. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she drops the card, accepting permanent joy-excision. Cost is on-page and irrevocable, meeting lens criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Marcus risk hearing the sound of belonging again? Pressure tightens once—from insulating with facts to the amp message that forces either further retreat or exposure. No external antagonist needed; public shaming and grief supply coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual but legible: silence as safe identity is foreclosed the instant he turns the phone back on.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will she harvest fame or become conduit?”—tightens as each luminous page abstracts the prize further. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the seed wants comprehension, not glory; this narrows her possible victory to an act of surrender, with tears as on-page cost. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can wonder survive routine?—is declared early and reiterated, but no beat narrows Asa’s options or tests her commitment; the ritual proceeds untroubled. Pressure is ambient (moon, tide, new arrivals) yet never complicates tactics or forces adaptation. The smelting of contradictions is described as painless, so cost stays conceptual. Without a tightening or trade-off, escalation remains atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—walls vs. connection—tightens when the collapsed floor forces Margret to confront the confession archive. Agency: her decision to lift the pearl forecloses her prior emotional bunker; price is the loss of professional anonymity now carrying private souls. Escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens: each shell read adds luminous weight to the pearl. No coincidence resolves; cost is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can she forgive herself for the flood in her mind—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each graffiti line tightens the metaphorical screw until “YOU WERE NOT DESTROYED” reweights her self-definition. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal. Cost is conceptual—she forfeits the musical release she once sought, embracing chronicler silence instead; the price is legible but not viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—enter the library of unspoken words before the watch stops—is signaled at dawn and tightened each time the hands reverse, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening: the future-written book confronts her with proof that documentation is part of the cipher, narrowing options to proceed. Cost is visible when the watch falls silent, its key function spent. Agency stays hers; no coincidences rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—catalog the violin vs. let it sing—tightens when the coffee vision force-feeds two concrete futures and the wisteria warns of caged fate. Escalation is lyrical but legible: each gap in provenance, each green whisper, raises the price of refusal until the bow-stroke forecloses one path. Cost is visible as frost and as the “promise losing its glow.”

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—capture the spark before oblivion—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: the threshold never tightens or fights back, and the “lucidly watchful” stance is declared rather than tested; escalation is purely accretive glow, lacking a visible price or narrowed option, so the beat never deepens under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—locating the missing interior “source of contentment”—tightens once: the summit sight of scallop clouds flips her framework from completion to perpetual tending. Pressure is textural/accumulative; each ascent layers density until the pattern break at the top. Cost is lyrical but legible: she forfeits the fantasy of finality and accepts lifelong custodial labor. No false antagonist needed; the conflict is stance vs. existential hollowness.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—keeping her doubt-driven practice sustainable—signaled early. Escalation is incremental: Thomas anecdote → self-mirror → dawn message; each beat thickens texture more than tightens options. No visible loss (tool, money, relationship) alters tactics; cost stays atmospheric. Sufficient for short lyric mode but lacks a decisive pressure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“learn vanishing by enduring delay”—is signaled early and deepens through each ripple; the fourth circle forces a stance crystallization that forecloses passive watching. Cost is legible: Mina relinquishes her expectation of being taught and accepts lifelong apprenticeship. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the pattern break at ring four satisfies the lens. Persistent constraint (she must keep throwing stones) is implied, not nailed to the final image, so it stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“navigate without moving”—is declared early but never tested by a fresh obstacle; pressure is atmospheric, not escalating. Mid-text bird scatter hints at distant danger yet alters zero tactics for the skimmer. No reversal narrows her options; the pulse simply waxes and wanes. Closure re-affirms original stance rather than foreclosing a path that was ever live.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—dignity of quiet attention versus automated efficiency—is signaled early; escalation is the single cadence shift when wards die and mist offers irreversible exit. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of algorithmic life for an unmapped garden, the absent keystone slot literalizing the trade. No reversal, but pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (drone delivery) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—receive, not seize, the color of sound—tightens once: effortful dives → stillness under meteor flare. No reversals needed; single cadence shift sufficient for lyric accumulative arc. Cost legible: years of numb fingers and burned eyes pay for the one moment of seeing saffron hum. Agency preserved—he chooses to wait, forecloses the old striving path.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the drive to wrest backward prophecy from noise—remains abstract; tangible consequences of failure or success are never staged. Pressure escalates only as pattern recognition: static layers, coin vibrates, meaning almost surfaces—no option is foreclosed. Agency is observational; the “cost” is existential patience, legible but soft. Sufficient tightening for 700-word lyric mode, yet not viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she re-enter the world of feeling without shattering her reaper function—tightens once when naming the first monster forecloses eternal numbness. Pressure is accumulative: each fragment of Elias’s voice adds density until the option of forgetting dies. Cost is legible: she forfeits the protective anonymity of fear itself. No causal antagonist needed; grief acts as coherent situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are declared early—“fish had stopped coming”—and tighten through the mage’s iterated drip-application: each droplet is an irreversible spend of thin magic that forecloses faster, flashier repair. Escalation is textural: pattern density (drip → crack narrowing → village silence lifting) reweights abundance without external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the town’s memory survive?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when she chooses to lay the photo trail instead of confining herself to technical notes. One meaningful escalation: discovery of the intact bottles converts private nostalgia into public evidence, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is legible; the approaching dawn crew externalizes the irreversible price of her decision. No reversal, but at this length a single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stake—“balance knowledge and feeling or everything crumbles”—stated early but never tested by an external jeopardy; no visible price is paid when the crystal becomes “a living thing.” Escalation is textural: starling patterns intensify, waterfall colors deepen, but options do not narrow; the transformation happens to her, not through a decisive trade-off. The final beat reweights meaning rather than foreclosing a path, satisfying the Accumulative lens yet leaving cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s survival via silent guidance—tightens once when the front shifts and the watcher must risk a new vector. The revision of heading 270 is the single decisive turn that forecloses earlier plan; cost is the unspoken possibility of having been wrong. Pressure is coherent but only one deep tightening; a second micro-escalation (icing, fuel, altitude loss) could have pushed it to 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—recover the capacity to feel—tightens through the single decisive blade beat that vivifies connection. Escalation is causal under the lens: the need to feel → the duel with the clone → the blade touch that cracks numbness. Cost is visible on the page: acceptance of permanent partial numbness in exchange for shared feeling. Coincidence is absent; the clone is legal requirement, not lucky intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting innovative space against market homogeneity—signaled early, revisited reflectively. Escalation is rhetorical (critics, investors, devotees) rather than an on-page event that forecloses an option; no scene of actual sponsorship walk-out or financial penalty. Seed’s stillness deepens theme but does not tighten external pressure; tension remains conceptual. Cost is diffuse—commercial pressure “mounting” off-stage—so the tightening needed for 8+ bands is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter”—is declared early, yet grief is static; it neither escalates nor pushes back. Each blower pass is texturally louder but causally identical: no discovered limitation, no new consequence, no narrowing of options. Without a visible price paid by either house or healer, pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can she convert exile into departure? Pressure accumulates via sensory intensification—cold, then impossible pendant heat, then thinning mist. One tightening: mist shifts from imprisoning veil to “generous boundary,” foreclosing perpetual vigilance. Cost is the seventeen winters already spent; future cost is the unmapped beyond she now must enter.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—interrupt a destiny of repeated failure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the crozier refuses to burn, forcing the subtraction insight. One meaningful turn: the recognition that release, not addition, is required immediately forecloses the preservation path. Cost is legible in the ashes of the crozier and the “empty hands” that follow. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will she cling to measurable data or surrender to unknowable silence—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the geometric silence widens, forcing her to abandon filters; price is loss of professional certitude. Agency is interior renunciation, not external action, but forecloses future methodology with felt cost. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via silence density; coincidence (lunar perigee) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent passenger dissolution—emerges early via radio urgency and tightens once: Maren must risk scattering herself to merge timelines. Cost is legible in the final image (“she had found a kind of home” in permanent transience), but escalation is single-step; no secondary reversal or resource loss alters tactics mid-course.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—control over perception versus surrender to her own altered memories—surfaces early and tightens once the hum/eruption makes her patterns self-directed. She does not newly act but continues weaving, a renunciation that accepts entanglement; this single deepening is sufficient for short form. Cost is legible (she abandons certainty) yet less viscerally felt than conceptually stated, keeping it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can starlight be read from beneath an ocean after alien disclosure? Tightening sequence: aliens announce departure → tonight is last chance to prove geometry works → Mira accepts the task, foreclosing retreat to old surface navigation. Cost is visible: she shoulders the duty of translating alien knowledge into human practice with no more help. Agency resides in her decision to begin the journey home “to help humanity hold steady,” a credible internal renunciation of safe ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elena locate a voice for Vera?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: static → pulse → whisper → location, each layer raising emotional cost. No reversal or trade-off is demanded of Elena; she listens, then runs. Because agency is observational, the tightening is felt more than chosen, keeping the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: retrieve mentor or join her—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation tightens once: the gold invitation offers the only exit from claustrophobic terror by surrendering to it. Price is visceral: dissolution of body into cable-memory. Agency is hers—hand on codex initiates irreversible transition. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the density of glowing copper, humming voices, and spreading gold yields the requisite pattern break that reweights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Mira keep indicting the system or accept the ghost’s regret?—tightens once when the ink yields the Comforter pattern, turning accusation into mourning. Cost is visible: she abandons the counting tether, relinquishing her last shield against erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save/transmute the dying language—tightens once: elders’ final phrases → Elara’s decision to speak her crafted words, foreclosing passive witness; cost is felt (curse weight, family bargain), but the beat is singular; no secondary reversal, yet the escalation suffices for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will Mira confront the transformed Amari and the truth he embodies—tightens when the vines coil upward and gravity loosens its grip, forcing her to decide: retreat or step into the untamed. The escalation is textural-densifying rather than causal-reversal, legitimate under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the physical lift-off and the frequency that rewrites her sensory floor. A second tightening beat would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can music still reawaken wonder?”—is signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural: each sensory accretion (tarnish, honey, shimmer) raises the cost of failure—she could petrify like the statues. The decisive tightening occurs when the statues step aside, crystallizing that her playing now forfeits retreat to the mechanical city. Price is legible: shell relinquished, future path irreversibly shifted to orchard guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Marcus’s neutrality vs. human need—signaled early and tested by Aram’s medicine request; escalation occurs when Marcus pockets the illegal package, narrowing his options to smuggle or betray. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under causal lens. Cost is visible: legal danger, possible loss of route, but could be sharper—no mention of prior punishments or personal stakes beyond professional code. Sufficient for length, but another line of personal risk would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is declared early but never tested by opposition; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No visible price or option foreclosure occurs on-page; escalation is a single lyrical lift at the halo. Acceptable for accumulative mode, yet barely clears the bar for felt cost. Agency is contemplative, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“can this scarf’s stories be re-embodied?”—is signaled early and deepened when the weave brightens, narrowing possibility from loss to legacy. Yet Miriam undertakes no trade-off; pressure is ambient, not personal. Escalation is textural (color shift, wall glow) rather than tactical. Sufficient for the length, but no visible price is exacted from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—granting lost dreams a momentary body—surfaces early and tightens when the child’s photograph reveals joy “leaked away,” forcing Mira to confront her own unspoken absence. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each restored image adds weight until the 1832 portrait turns the tool inward. No external antagonist or reversal, yet the cost is felt when her lifelong ache is pinned to the wall, foreclosing endless searching.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate the sealed idea—is signaled early and tightens when the chamber opens to a single sentence; the cost is the spent years and the relinquishing of the hair-key. Escalation is present but gentle, delivered via textural deepening rather than a reversible turn; pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens once: skeptical dismissal → bodily surrender to ring’s glow; the single deepening is sufficient, cost is legible (salt tears, foreclosed empiricism), but external antagonist (barons) remains off-stage, so pressure is atmospheric rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—mentor resilience in broken children—is signaled early and tightens through the girl’s chin-lift/boy’s shrink dynamic. One meaningful deepening: the boy reaches for tea without protection, foreclosing the rejection option. Cost is felt—Maren’s backward step and chest-clench—but not yet externalized as persistent constraint, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared early—“preserve the color of wonder”—but no counter-force or complication ever endangers that goal within the scene; pressure is steady-state. The pruning clears pathways, yet no consequence narrows Elara’s options or raises the cost of failure. The single beat is completion, not escalation, so the dominant stake is restated rather than tested, keeping tension meditative rather than rising.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped spirit—signals early; agency is continuous (each unpicked knot). Pressure escalates texturally: the hush breathes, shimmer grows, options narrow to the last knot. Cost is implied rather than concrete—no tool lost, no social risk—so the tightening stays lyrical, not visceral, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“understand letting go”—is signaled early and tightens once when the sealed note forces Miriam to trade lone custodianship for outward delivery. The cost is palpable in her final vow; pressure deepens rather than reverses, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single stake—make the ghost’s song audible—tightens when Mira’s own voice becomes the required medium; the lightning-thunder gap acts as an on-page clock that forces the final encoding beat. Cost is legible: surrender of her solitary aesthetic; minor knock for abstraction of physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to violate or respect privacy—surfaces the moment the compartment clicks open; pressure escalates as each decoded line raises emotional stakes. The mid-story tightening is the daughter entry, which makes the secret too alive to ignore and forecloses moral simplicity. Cost is felt: Mira gains empathy but loses the innocence of not-knowing. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve knowledge under erasure”—is signaled early and sharpened by dawn deadline. One meaningful tightening: the distant demolition growl collapses infinite pattern into final painted arc. Agency is present in every beat; the cost is the coming loss of both tree and artwork, felt as “heightened stillness.” No escalation flaw, though coin’s power could have confronted her with a harder tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (“chart the next great discovery”) are declared early but never tested by opposition or risk; pressure escalates only as intensified attention, not narrowed options. No live trade-off or price is dramatized, so the tightening remains intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—acquire celestial gears to fulfill her calling—tightens once: the mirrors demand total surrender of the gears she hoped to use. Agency is present (she chooses to give them away), but because the prophecy foretells the exchange, pressure feels pre-set rather than newly forged. Cost is visible—she leaves empty-handed—yet the emotional weight is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is communal belonging versus ongoing ecological neglect; signaled early with “strangers into family.” Escalation is textural: each chalked coordinate and restored flowerbed adds moral pressure until the bell ring becomes inevitable. The visible price is the sweat and vulnerability of shared labor—Lena’s relinquishing hoard, Eli risking authority. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening that reweights their identity from survivors to stewards. Cost is legible but lightly felt; could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve beauty at the final ending—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens only once: the last adjustment, the last documentation. The clock’s acceleration provides the single meaningful escalation; options narrow to “witness or fail to witness.” No visible price is paid on the page—no broken skin, no forfeited memory, no door sealed forever—so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping entry to the 7-band. Agency is present but entirely interior; the world ends regardless, so the tension is aesthetic, not survival.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—lost travelers vs. frost-sealed mechanism—tightens once via the birds’ accelerating alarm; Mira’s agency is decisive insertion, not observation. Price is paid immediately: her immunity momentarily breaks, cold bites foot, then the irrevocable surrender of the nut forecloses retreat. Escalation is single but sufficient; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—signalled in second paragraph and tested by the empty chrysalis she still carries. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each foam spiral adds density until the pattern itself forces the re-cognition that separation = emergence. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible: she gives up the hope of retrospective forgiveness and accepts transformed continuation instead.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake is intellectual—can she read the library’s negative language?—but no external or internal pressure escalates; the lull merely permits reflection. The single “tightening” is the recognition that absence shapes stories, yet it neither narrows her options nor exacts a price. Agency is purely attentional. Enough for micro-length, but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: survive the pavilion’s remorse without being subsumed. Escalation is textural—each coral touch swells the emotional load until the counter-cooking must match intensity. One meaningful tightening: when she realizes she can “smooth” rather than absorb, options narrow to three days of ritual endurance. Cost is visible in the closing “sturdy brittle” fragility; no coincidence is used to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—revive communal song from silo silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must broker the brothers’ feud to obtain regulator springs. One meaningful escalation: the linguistic intercession itself becomes the bridge, narrowing options (she must speak or fail). Cost is legible but generalized (“weeks of work”); no single moment shows her forfeiting rest or reputation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—inherit or abandon entangled dreams—surfaces at mirror lift and tightens once: she must re-engineer the mirror or lose the chorus. Single meaningful escalation is the overnight modification that forecloses her former linear career; cost is the irreversible neural rewrite. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only presents, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“lost methods of preservation against time’s erosion”—is signaled early and tightens when the one-hour clock begins. Escalation is textural: each inverted image adds density until the markings resolve, narrowing options to “perceive or lose.” Cost is visible: she pays with twenty years of exile and the imminent retreat of the patterns. Agency is present but could be sharper; she follows mist-shaped letters rather than forcing a choice that endangers the prize.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—coax sound from a hushed world—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when silence refuses to yield. The single escalation beat (strum → hairline resonance → full grove chord) is protagonist-driven and irreversible: once the siskin answers, the world is audibly altered. Cost is ambient but legible: the song may be ephemeral, the grove may fall silent again.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is survival of purpose under silence; pressure is atmospheric, tightening only through image repetition, not plot turns. No reversal narrows options—eclipse retreats, but tutor’s situation is unchanged. Cost is abstract (perpetual silence); no visible forfeiture on the page. Meets Accumulative/Textural escalation but stays static under causal reading.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: recover access to her life’s catalogue without violence; secondary: confirm that empathy-through-listening still works. Pressure tightens once: the external firework countdown + the internal jammed clasp force her to hit the emotional, not merely technical, frequency. Cost is visible—she almost loses forty years of work—and the final image forecloses nostalgically hoarding silence; she steps outside to accept post-celebration quiet. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (fireworks) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transform ambition into serenity—tightens once when the bloom’s rot forces her to inhale what revolts her, foreclosing the old rush-for-cures path. Escalation is textural: scent density increases until it reweights her value system; no coincidence. Visible cost is the surrender of “next remedy, next recognition” (stated in text). Could edge higher if one mid-scene loss (tool, time, social credit) had altered tactics earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“source of resilience”—signaled early and sharpened by inversion hourglass. Agency manifests in tactile choice: reaching through viewport to seize glowing arrow; stakes tighten when bloom shows planetary self-healing she could commodify. Escalation is accumulative: each surreal image ups the temptation until renunciation forecloses profit. Cost is visible: she swallows the secret, alone, while Kestrel descends empty-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the hidden pattern—tightens when the vortex’s bolt-loosening force gives visceral confirmation. One meaningful deepening: evacuation flips from panic to deliberate cultivation, narrowing her moral option to expose it. Cost is implicit but legible: the town’s silence becomes collateral she must now carry. No second reversal, but single intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    A single dominant stake—prove wonder essential to keep the world warm—is signaled in paragraph two and held to the end. Pressure tightens once: the silent cavern “unfetters” into symphonic resonance, reweighting the hush from absence to presence; this deepening fulfills the lens. No reversal or trade-off is forced upon Yara; the beat is revelation, not decision, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Enough for strong mid-band, but without a moment where her synesthesia exacts a visible price the escalation stays poetic, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—how to atone for letting the Weaving unravel—tightens via the imposed canyon hush: she must endure silence instead of fixing. One meaningful deepening: arranging the final constellation-pattern markers crystallizes her shift from “guardian-actor” to “witness,” narrowing future options. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is felt—she forfeits the right to ever play the flute—but could be sharper if the text let us hear her almost-play and then withhold.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—complete self-erasure vs. preserving empathic archive—tightens once: the moment she presses the fragment to her chest, transparency becomes irreversible. Cost is visible: “her own personality begin to borrow” until she is “becoming transparent.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each borrowed signature adds density of light, not narrative reversal, culminating in luminous stasis. No coincidence; vanishing stars externalize the internal arithmetic, complicating but not rescuing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—extend wonder rather than hoard memory—signals early via incomplete handoffs. Tightening occurs when pendant wings move: option of passive remembrance foreclosed, active germination required. Cost is felt: mentor dissolves, leaving Elara alone with new vocation. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Mira confronts becoming such an object herself. One meaningful deepening: yearly frost patterns softening from “jagged screaming” to “something softer” shows the dead woman’s release and foreshadows Mira’s own merger. Cost is felt in her startled realization and the smile that accepts it. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and accumulative under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—send the message—tightens exactly once: when she realizes the price is her existence. The deepening narrows options from “weave” to “become,” a causal turn driven by her agency. Cost is legible: her physical absence on the loom. No external coincidence; the orchard’s silence is coherent pressure, not antagonist gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can rubble be coaxed toward resilience?”—tightens as Cael’s body pays nightly fatigue for each meter cleared; the first blossom is the visible price that reconfigures hope. Agency remains cumulative rather than a single reversal; pressure builds through “quietly determined” repetition until the community’s weeping converts private labor into shared stake. Cost is legible on the page in aching knees and soot-dark nights.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover mentor’s withheld truth—faces a single tightening when Kira realizes the truth is her own wound. Pressure escalates via cognitive tilt rather than external obstacle; the shard’s glow is the visible price. No reversal, but the deepening reweights options: rescue becomes self-acceptance. Cost is conceptual, felt in final line, satisfying short-form scale.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: give the dead sailors a witness so the lamp will guide the living again. Pressure escalates through each new stone stack; the seventh stack becomes the decisive, visible trade-off. Cost is felt—Maren surrenders her grandmother’s talisman and her own silence. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake early: guide three unseen ships safely. Pressure escalates by density—each ship materializing tightens the ritual demand—but no lived option is foreclosed; keeper never risks failure or personal loss. Cost abstract (eternal vigilance) rather than tactile on page. Meets single-deepening rule for lyric mode yet lacks visible price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mapping sorrow to keep the labyrinth livable—tightens once: the storm forces the parapet ascent that triggers the deconstruction. Agency is observational (she “witnesses” rather than fights), yet the unfolding itself is irreversible and narrows her future labor to “unmaking.” Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of opaque walls. A second tightening beat is absent, capping escalation below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore dawn—signals in line 2 and tightens once: the Binding Chant’s final note forces the trade of Elara’s fragmented self for collective hope. Agency is present (she chooses to sing), pressure escalates through the dimming Heart-Tree and trembling panes, and the cost is legible on-page as her identity pours outward. No reversal is required at this length; the single deepening satisfies Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—return home vs remain hidden—arrives late via invitation; prior tension is ambient regret, not escalating pressure. One meaningful tightening at midnight lamps-dim beat shifts knowledge: she can be both here and not-here. Cost is asserted (mother still alive) rather than dramatized; no resource, reputation, or emotional price is visibly paid on this page, keeping escalation shy of high band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“prevent total neglect by noticing and tending”—is declared early; escalation is accretive, not perilous. One meaningful tightening: the bread’s appearance reframes her ritual into communion/absolution. Cost is poetic rather than practical; options never truly narrow, keeping the score shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: keep vows from vanishing. Escalation is textural: each sampled slide shows further spectral drift, tightening the emotional noose. The midpoint reversal—compassion vow has already left the visible spectrum—forces her pivot to story-preservation. Cost is conceptual (loss of magical binding) rather than visceral, but legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve truth about father vs. surrender his lucky fob—tightens once, at the final hand-off. Each failed meeting raises the sunk-cost pressure; the scarred woman’s arrival crystallizes the last option. Agency is present: Mara voices the refusal, feels the fob warm. Cost is conceptual (she may now “capture the sound herself”) rather than tangible; that slightly blunts the felt price needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mira accept immeasurable truth?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: tasting the compass ushers Seren, forcing confrontation. However, Seren’s arrival is external coincidence; Mira does not wager or forfeit anything visible. Cost is conceptual (loss of pure skepticism) rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Escalation is textural—aurora brightens, taste shifts—sufficient under Accumulative lens but thin for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Mira re-enact silencing or restore Elena’s vision?—tightens when unfinished grandmother portrait confronts her with half-erased identity. Stakes escalate through accumulative sensory density, not external antagonist; each pulse of quartz light ups moral glare until remaining option is public self-indictment via paint. Protagonist agency drives turn: she kneels, forfeits former detachment, accepts lifelong comparison with dead sister’s bolder palette. Cost is felt immediately—the blank side of the face will now bear her confession, not Elena’s.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mira recover the words honesty cost and pay that cost herself? Each map fragment raises the price of proceeding deeper into derelict zones. The moment she chooses to write with her own gold leaf tightens the stake—she now risks sharing her 师傅’s fate. The escalation is single-curve but coherent; a more explicit obstacle (air toxicity flare, physical weakness) would have made the price visceral and pushed higher.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—candor as survival—emerges through the gilded letters, the wilting 师傅, and the unsent wall, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: Mira’s fingers on corroded type, gold catching candlelight like “small suns.” The final image of a garden of silence grown from speech refuses a moral, offering Charged Poise instead. A hair less resonance because Mira’s own prior self-censorship is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve the color of wonder by keeping the iceberg’s frequency alive. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than option narrowing; no reversal or trade-off is dramatized on-page. The “cost” is conceptual—the endless labor of tuning—felt in the final image but not etched into a specific forfeiture now. Sufficient escalation for lyric mode, yet lacks a visible price that alters tactics this day.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—save roses by curing her own signal noise—tightens when magnetic shift corrupts their feedlines. Escalation is textural: static density mounts in her processors until language itself fragments; roses’ inward curl mirrors her folding of fears. One decisive turn: she shifts from external repair to internal ingestion of chaos, foreclosing sterile detachment. Price is irreversible hybridization—she ends less machine, more mortal uncertainty—visible in “strangely organic” pulse that no manual can calibrate.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are thematic ("prove listening heals") rather than personal; Elena risks no tangible loss. Pressure escalates only narratively—letters accumulate, stories spread—but none tightens her options or exacts a price. The single micro-choice (open mailbox) is curiosity, not dilemma. Cost is displaced onto the long-dead grandmother and the now-reconciled sisters; Elena’s own stance never faces a test.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freedom through decoded self—signals early and tightens once: the moment water begins to drain, all prior accumulations (dice counts, cipher dances) foreclose surrender. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the drainage beat delivers a single decisive intensification that re-weights every prior sacrifice. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the exit is unlocked by her own embedded frequencies. Cost is visible in the drained chamber—eleven years gone, voice irretrievably relocated into muscle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering her mother’s deleted memory—surfaces early and tightens when gravity’s pull literalizes the emotional weight of forgetting. The coffee-ground divination provides one visible micro-turn that narrows options, steering her into the densest gravity pocket; the cost is the irreversibility of witnessing the sealed memory. Pressure escalates by accretion rather than reversal: each crystal she passes is a skipped beat of town guilt pressing on her chest. The ending does not reverse the stakes but crystallizes them, a valid Accumulative deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent a coded prophecy from hardening into destiny—tightens through silence-accretion rather than external opposition. One decisive deepening: the prophecy flips from threat to “desperate plea” across the hush-bridge, narrowing her options to renunciation rather than combat. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she loses the future as map, gains it as open water. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is coherent and internalized under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s need to understand why she was drawn—tightens when she realizes the price is perpetual mystery. One meaningful reversal: she moves from interrogation to protective renunciation, narrowing her future knowledge. Accumulative pressure via architectural grammar lessons and meteor shower; no coincidence resolves. Cost visible in her voiced relinquishment; option to “know” foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mira accept the shell’s impossible message—tightens once, at the exact moment the voice resolves into Elena; that deepening shifts knowledge and forecloses pure skepticism. Pressure stays internal and textural, appropriate to the accumulative lens, with no external antagonist required. The cost is conceptual (paradigm loss) rather than tangible, but it is legible on the page. A second tightening beat is absent, keeping the escalation single-arc rather than compound.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover vs. endanger living memory—signals early and sharpens when the Keeper links personal lineage to archival erasure. Mid-story tightening occurs as Yuki realizes the chest is a lie and the real lock is her own intent, foreclosing passive retrieval. Price is conceptual but legible: she forfeits physical proof, accepting perpetual vulnerability for truth’s survival. Would climb higher if the forfeiture were externalized in a beat of observable risk (e.g., aurora dimming as guards approach).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is declared early, but never tested or sharpened. Pressure is atmospheric (hum grows louder) rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is a slow volume knob, not a turning screw. Agency remains observational; the final step is exploratory, not irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring the child’s identity—emerges early and tightens as dream fragments converge, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no moment narrows options or exacts an explicit sacrifice. The pressure plate is a gentle accretion rather than a reversible choice, keeping cost legible yet soft.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of rescued memory emerges through recurrent water-and-light imagery rather than statement; the final image of naming the child crystallizes the stakes without moralizing. Complexity is present—salvage versus letting the sea keep its dead—but ambiguity is curated rather than challenged, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“see invisible threads of hidden effort”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through pattern accrual: moon paths, net grammar, father’s ignorance, firefly grief-joy. No external antagonist, but the risk of remaining unseen herself intensifies until the whistle act crystallizes her stance with on-page cost (vulnerability of “grown woman calling to ghosts”). One meaningful deepening sufficient for 700-word piece; price is legible in final image, meeting 8.8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stake—truth vs. comfortable lie—is declared early. Pressure intensifies only once, when letters reveal deliberate exposure, but the beat is summary; no visible option is foreclosed on-page, so tightening stays conceptual rather than tactical, capping the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: validate her variant allegiance before the scattered houses unite. Escalation via each radio fragment that foretells “child of storms,” tightening options until she must act. Cost: the portico’s destruction, sacrificing her only filter. Agency sits in her deliberate palm-to-glass move; coincidence complicates storm but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—give voice to silences—emerges late; escalation is textural (density of remembered clients) rather than causal narrowing. No on-page trade-off or price paid for the new vocation; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Coincidence (granddaughter arrives same day) supplies complication but also resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent ice maelstrom—declared by line 6, then intensified through audible frequency drift and subsonic tremor. Single meaningful tightening at the climax (she locates counter-frequency) forecloses failure path and costs physical depletion. Agency stays with Maren throughout; coincidence unused. Price is present but low-band visceral; needed a sharper forfeiture to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—map a horizon only patience can reveal—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: nightly moon paths thicken the lattice of meaning until the viaduct’s hum fuses with lunar reflection, forcing a tacit trade-off: personal disappearance into the work. Cost is legible in the final tone-shift: spring will change the world “no other cartographer would think to map,” implying irreversible outsider status.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes—uncover hidden murder versus bureaucratic cover-up—are signaled early and tighten when Chen’s obstruction is revealed. Yet pressure plateaus: the memory download solves the mystery for her, replacing protagonist agency with supernatural convenience. No tangible resource is lost or risked on-page; the cost is deferred to implied future retaliation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—how to sanctify mechanical repair into emotional restitution—surfaces by paragraph 3 and tightens once: hesitation → inscription → restored melody. Micro-turn is credible but singular; no further narrowing or price (money, reputational, physical) is risked. Pressure is situational and lyric rather than adversarial; sufficient for sub-800-word arc but not scalding. Cost is off-loaded onto the daughter’s future tears, not the protagonist’s skin.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: transmute nameless yearning into audible bell. Escalation is accretive—each transliteration session deepens pattern density until only one slot/angle remains, foreclosing further play. Visible price: cart’s re-tuned ribs vibrate at alien frequency, implying irreversible retrofit. Cost is legible; however, no external obstacle resists the attempt, so pressure is internal/lyric, not adversarial—holds under Accumulative lens, caps below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find what deleted means”—tightens as each 47 recurrence eliminates the “coincidence” option. Agency is intellectual (decoding, scrolling, choosing to leave door open) rather than physical; cost is conceptual but legible. No secondary reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices. Persistent constraint (company oversight) is implied, not dramatized on page, holding below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“see clearly enough to guide ships”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens once when the fragment’s faces merge into an expectant single gaze, forcing her choice to act as living lens. Cost is conceptual (lifetime weight of accurate sight) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency sits in her decision to walk toward the passage; no reversal, yet a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Escalation would sharpen if ship distress were shown rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—acquire the “sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early and deepens through tactile wreck work. One meaningful tightening: handling the parasol tip shifts from tether to farewell token, foreclosing retreat. Pressure stays accumulative; no external antagonist needed. Cost legible in final loosened grip; option space narrows to single forward path.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Elias release Mira without erasing her? The single meaningful tightening occurs when he pockets the fragment “one final time,” narrowing future options. Cost is conceptual but legible: the possibility of retrieval is extinguished. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the accumulative pattern of departures (bus, workers, Mira) makes the final stance feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes—“lines are forgetting themselves”—are declared early but never tested on-page; no boundary slips or threatens to. The single pressure point is her own fatigue of purpose, not external opposition. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the patrol ends where it began. Cost is asserted (“someone had to remember”) but not dramatized, keeping escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“transmute pain into masterpiece”—is declared early but never tightens; no new obstacle or trade-off appears. Pressure is ambient (decay, forgetting) rather than acute, so the story accretes rather than escalates. The final image deepens meaning but does not narrow Maren’s options or raise personal cost; escalation remains textural, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: the exhaustion of language itself. Pressure tightens when the crystal offers “testimony” Elias cannot catalogue; this deepens, rather than reverses, his trajectory toward acceptance. No external antagonist needed—the conflict is internal and situational, coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: the dictionary is closed, his life’s work complete and therefore useless.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early; pressure mounts as ambient hush thickens, narrowing to the microscopic cartilage creak. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical: she never risks failure or expends resource, so the cost is implied audience empathy rather than visible on-page forfeiture. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode, but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the ephemeral without crushing it”—is signaled early and tightens once when the lens pivots from clouds to spinning hand. Escalation is density/cadence driven: tremor → leaf sound → shutter clicks; options narrow to acceptance. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the father-return fantasy. Agency is internal but visible.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Margery—and Elara—finish life with dignity intact. Escalation is accumulative: each mundane object thickens emotional density until the final spoon-strike tightens the cadence and forecloses the option of despair. Cost is visible: Elaria’s tremor when she lifts the relic shows her own fear spent to purchase Margery’s calm. No coincidence; all pressure is internally generated.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled inside 100 words and tightened once: each closed loop makes the hidden shadow less elusive. Agency remains with Elara throughout; the seventh circle forecloses failure and the price (key burns, world-rule re-curved) is legible. No reversal beyond the single deepening, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can she convert eighteen years of maternal fracture into something the replacement child can carry? Pressure tightens once via the tooth’s activation—no reversal, but options reconfigure. Cost is felt: she forfeits official “resolution.” Agency drives the final stance; coincidence is absent. Enough for 8+ but lacks a second pressure spike.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—how to position herself vis-à-vis her mother’s viral confession—crystallizes early, but pressure stays internal and static. No second on-page character or deadline narrows her real-time options; the risk remains emotional/abstract. The “tightening” is a shift in metaphor density, not a choice with forfeiture; hence mid-band. Needed: one live micro-choice here (answer the phone? leave the pendant?) to make cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake is the blocked novelist’s need to re-engage her art. Pressure accumulates via ghostly tableaux of abandoned stories, but no narrowing fork or trade-off is forced; the protagonist never risks or forfeits anything tangible. The final “ready to write” is an internal shift without an observable price that alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—restore the moonvine or accept permanent loss—arrives early and tightens through pattern accretion: moon sinking, sun cresting, song rising. Escalation is one slow squeeze rather than sharp reversal; alignment window narrows, stakes accumulate, but no live trade-off complicates tactics. Cost is aesthetic and communal, not personal-risk, keeping pressure lyrical rather than combustive. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks the visible price that would punch into 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve/transform final heartbeat—signaled early; single meaningful tightening occurs when the last sheet is burned, foreclosing further maps. Escalation is density-driven: each discarded relic adds symbolic weight until the spiral’s glow reweights options. Cost is conceptual but legible—once the paper burns, the map is fixed, Elara’s labor complete, path foreclosed. No visible price to Elara herself (no frostbite, doubt, or resource loss), keeping it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“harvest echoes correctly without destroying the timer”—tightens once: realization that repair means repurposing, not restoration, foreclosing the original function. Escalation is accretive under Accumulative lens: each mirror session adds density until the pattern break (purpose shift) reweights stakes. Cost is legible on-page in the seasonal timeframe commitment. Could use one intermediate micro-loss (tool fatigue, echo overflow) to hit 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she keep weaving at the price of her body—tightens once when calcification climbs past knuckles. Pressure is accumulative: each thread adds silence and stone, narrowing future motion. The cost is visible in calcified flesh, but the escalation is steady rather than acute; one sharper turn would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: transform absence into form without betraying wildness. Pressure escalates by texture—each curl of shaved wood tightens the emotional torque rather than narrows external options. The “containment” choice is reiterated with rising specificity (mane strand by strand) until the eyes’ insertion makes the cost irreversible. No external antagonist, but the kettle’s ignored whistle is an audible reminder that domestic time is forfeited for carved eternity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the ghost cede the right to haunt?—tightens via accretion of overheard failures. No external antagonist; pressure is ontological: each fragment adds weight to the camera literal and metaphorical. Cost is legible when Mira admits she carries “other people’s abandoned futures.” A single deeper tightening would punch into 8.8+ territory, but escalation stays within accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—prove the terminal salvageable—signals early. Pressure rises once when she calculates the aquifer angle, narrowing options. However, no live opposition or resource loss is dramatized; approval is granted off-page, diffusing cost. The only visible price is “seventeen days,” stated, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering a deliberately erased waterway—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the sundial confirms the lost hour. Agency is intellectual rather than physical: she “steered the barge toward older construction,” a decision that forecloses safer moorings. Cost is conceptual (history itself is fragile) rather than personal, visible but not felt on the body. One meaningful deepening suffices; the pressure is coherent yet stays academic, keeping it just above the 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve or lose the weavers’ code—surfaces early and tightens as fog erases the harbor, forcing attention inward. One meaningful deepening: knots change from utilitarian to script, narrowing options to “plant the code.” No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative; cost is legible but internal, not externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping absence while becoming one—tightens through pattern accumulation; the final cadence shift crystallizes cost, though the escalation is more tonal than tactical, keeping pressure just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty or end the machine”—is signaled early and tightens when the egg reveals symbiosis instructions, foreclosing the kill-switch option. Pressure is coherent but single-stage; no new obstacle after entry, only revelation. Cost is conceptual (inheritance of integrator’s burden) rather than visceral, capping entry below 8.8. Still, the shift is protagonist-driven and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prove scars can sing—i.e., that her father’s arson legacy can be transmuted into protective graft rather than inherited destruction. Pressure tightens once: the lagoon’s surface shift from black mirror to molten gold forces the final re-cognition that fire and water are the same dance. No external antagonist needed; the stakes are internal and vocational. Cost is the perpetual scent of smoke she will carry back to the village—felt, visible, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signaled early; pressure escalates through incremental unstick steps, each fountain tightening methodical focus. No live option is foreclosed; cost is atmospheric rather than tactical. Sufficient for length, but price remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient understanding versus easy answers emerges through pattern of fountains and sidereal imagery; no moral is stated. Final “deflating dusk” image reweights earlier glow without sermon. One soft echo: “mysteries simply refused to resolve” flirts with thesis language but is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and deepens when the gear’s self-ticking introduces a colder illumination that may obviate the custodian. One meaningful tightening: the gear’s autonomy narrows Vael’s options from active carrier to passive witness. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the closing whispered secret: the next bearer will inherit a tool that no longer needs a hand. Agency is renunciation-by-acceptance, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—how to shape communal grief—tightens when the butterfly cloud ascends, forcing her public utterance of the ribbon poem. The ascent is not coincidence but ecological deadline; refusal would leave her outside the collective motion. Cost is visible: she forfeits the privacy of silent carving and accepts the spectral audience as co-witnesses. Agency is Accumulative: each loop of glass, poem, and wingbeat layers pressure until speech is the only release.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can the thirty-seven-second pause redistribute lifelong guilt—signaled early. Single meaningful tightening at apex: options narrow to feeling the full weight or continuing descent; no external coincidence required. Agency = endurance/renunciation; cost = lifelong carrying made visible in rake and careful footfalls. Escalation causal under lens; no reversal needed. Price legible on page; enters 8-band but lacks additional constraint that would push 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is whether anyone will answer the sovereign’s dying question; pressure is atmospheric, not antagonistic, and tightens only through contemplative decoding. One meaningful deepening occurs when the border’s fraying is read as “memories slipping away,” turning passive observation into urgent transcription. Yet the protagonist faces no trade-off—no risk of being trapped, no opposition, no visible price—so escalation is modest and the closure, while resonant, is cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can she write possibility without false certainty—tightens once: refusal to script a single future narrows her options to constellation-only. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: density of mirrored ice shards, feather’s shimmer, and blank page intensify the stakes. Cost is conceptual but legible; a more visceral forfeiture could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will stories survive?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened only once, when patrol proximity is re-asserted by the hidden dial light. Agency is continuous preparation rather than a decisive fork; the singing itself is the first on-page risk, but it is also the ending beat. Cost is atmospheric (discovery could mean death), yet not dramatized as a concrete forfeiture. Sufficient for this length and Accumulative lens, but the absence of a visible price keeps it from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—make an honest vessel for a grandmother who eluded her—remains clear, but escalation proceeds by accretive metaphor rather than narrowing options; once the mask is built, no further obstacle or trade-off complicates the burn. The final beat still lands a cost (she leaves carrying unknowable fragments), satisfying the lens, but pressure plateaus after the mask is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is epistemic—preserve truthful history against official erasure—signaled early. Escalation occurs through accumulative density: each recovered document narrows his future to solitary scholarship, raising the cost of abandonment. The tightening is textural rather than causal-turn, fitting the Accumulative lens; final “traces behind” crystallizes the irreversible stance. No visible resource loss beyond time/social ties, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it just below 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—restoration of voice through listening—signals early and tightens via the student’s reluctant posture, but escalation is observational, not adversarial. No external or internal obstacle raises the price inside this scene; the risk remains retrospective (“voices could be dangerous”) rather than immediate. One micro-turn—student’s hands emerge—does re-weight silence into possibility, satisfying minimal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will she let knowledge be erased or swallow its cost?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: swallowing the seed forecloses her outsider anonymity. No reversals are needed; the Accumulative pattern deepens via each pruning cut until the final stance crystallizes. Cost is legible: she internalizes generations of sorrow and celebration, a synaptic burden she must now feed to others. Pressure coheres under the inferred lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“why houses feel alive”—is declared early but never narrowed or tested by an opposing force or possible misreading; tension is atmospheric, not decisive. No visible price (time, safety, social credit) alters her tactics. Meaningful tightening is the final conceptual flip, yet it complicates nothing she could have chosen otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. embrace contradiction—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accretion of memories, but no beat forces Thalassor to act or surrender a concrete guard-duty tactic; the diver scene complicates without narrowing his options, so cost remains conceptual rather than tactical.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: certainty as cruelty, contradiction as life. The foxglove duality and coral’s animal-mineral paradox reprice the premise without moralizing. Final image of “keeper of questions” offers resonant, non-literal answer; ambiguity stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can cognitive pattern break the prison? Pressure escalates through iterated dice throws that progressively foreclose wrong variables; the “rupture” is epistemic, not physical. One meaningful tightening: the moment she realizes the formula was misapplied—this narrows her options from escape to reinterpretation. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, visible on-page in her trembling hands, keeping the beat inside high-band but just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: prove kindness leaves traceable marks. Pressure accumulates via repetitive failure to decode; waxing moon intensifies pattern until meaning breaks through. One visible cost: she forgoes sleep and abandons the paintings—material/time loss. No external antagonist, but internal loneliness acts as coherent pressure. Escalation is density-driven, not causal-turn driven, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—keep the arts alive vs. keep them hidden—tightens once: thaw melts the camouflaging ice, forcing the外露 decision. The price (possible discovery) is legible, but only a single deepening occurs; additional tactical complications would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—evade carved fate—is signaled early and re-visited by the hunger stone. Pressure tightens once: the yoyo’s successful counter-spin dissolves reality, foreclosing retreat. Cost is total (self-erasure), visible in the dissolving walls. Escalation is singular but decisive; no reversal or complication beyond the final threshold, keeping it just under the 8.5 mark.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—break the photographic curse by confronting fear—is signaled at the first mirror. Escalation tightens once: the mirror dresses her in the cloak she doesn’t wear, forcing the verbal surrender. Cost is the loss of the dictionary conduit and the advisor’s guidance; photograph reverts, proving the foreclosed path. Agency sits entirely in the spoken confession; coincidence only complicates reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake: transmute oceanic chaos into human-heard harmony. Escalation is textural—each dub layer tightens the sonic web until the wave-cymbal crash becomes the irrevocable last note that forecloses silence; cost is the eternal obligation to keep listening/playing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find what the watchers overlook—signaled early; escalation is the rising thermal glow of the shell after the whistle, foreclosing passive observation. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals. Cost is implicit in potential awakening, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to resurrect the lie—is signaled early and tightens once: the unsealed letter forces the choice. Pressure is situational: the station’s ghosts and the town’s living myth bear down until she crystallizes her stance. No new reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 700 words; cost is conceptual (she will lose grandfather’s halo) and felt on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she transcend passive observation—tightens when artifact discovery forces either retreat with prize or risk isolation to embed testimony. Tide clock supplies escalating external pressure; each inch of water narrows escape window and symbolically drowns her old methodology. Internal/external conflicts braid: professional protocol vs. pilgrim desire, both tested by cold water reaching ankles. Cost is felt: she forfeits immediate safety and future bureaucratic approval, choosing artifactual conversation over sanctioned report.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving suppressed truth—surfaces by paragraph two and deepens as marginalia patterns metastasize into a hidden archive. Escalation is textural: density of evidence (stamp match, manuscript, sanctuary plan) increases until Mira’s endurance stance crystallizes; the cost is the irrevocable decision to join the clandestine chain, foreclosing her safe bureaucratic life, legible in the final “slow certainty of sediment.”

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“hunt unused potential”—is signaled early and deepens through reiterations of cooling LEDs and geode warmth, reweighting cost of endless search under Accumulative lens. Tightening occurs cognitively rather than via new external threat; one on-page turn sufficient at this length. No price paid inside scene (already lost wife, status), but conceptual cost crystallizes at end. High band secured; lacked visible new constraint to push ≥8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened when the sealed relay station denies conventional access. Single meaningful escalation: star positions + chip + lever pull foreclose the option to keep searching; cost is the irrevocable recognition that no external answer exists. Agency resides in the pull; coincidence merely enables, does not resolve. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-architectural.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from stellar inscription to final map: belonging is not found but remembered. Subtext operates in the pilgrim’s vanished trace and the “stars remember” line, reweighted when Mira sees her own life in the branching paths. No moralizing; the final line offers Charged Poise. Recurrent motif (star trails) constrains tactics rather than decorating scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she face the truth she buried for her mother—tightens once when the watch hand surfaces, foreclosing denial. Agency is contemplative endurance rather than external action, appropriate to lyric-accumulative mode; cost is legible in the final charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will they repeat or break the inherited ritual? Pressure tightens once—the dark moon and neutral ground compress options to stay or release. Escalation is textural: each sensory recall (bedroom ruins, grandfather’s brow) adds weight to the brass until the simultaneous drop fractures the pattern. Agency is joint renunciation; cost is the audible loss of the last tangible tether. Coincidence is absent; tension is situational and symbolic rather than causal, but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“can she still navigate without depth perception?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens via each pole she must now use as surrogate star. Agency is legible: after the first pole slips by on her left she consciously steers toward the second, then the third, each stroke narrowing the option to retreat. Cost accumulates unequally: the physical price (tired shoulder, salt sting) is lightly sketched, but the psychic price—public evidence that she is “finding a new way forward”—is underscored by the gull-startled laugh that makes the risk of humiliation real. The escalation is single-cycle yet coherent under the causal lens, sufficient for this length but not quite the 8.8+ band that would demand a sharper forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can empathy be cultivated without memory?—is signaled early and tightens when the baseball warms, marking proximity to a decisive threshold. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each branching tunnel adds weight rather than narrows options causally. A visible price is felt—the traveler’s “weary kindness” implies aeons of failed timelines—yet the protagonist’s agency is largely receptive rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—reunite with Korin across death—signals inside 120 words and tightens once: the ritual irrevocably dissolves her human boundaries. The price is visceral (perpetual half-beast existence) but paid narratively rather than dramatized in a beat of agony; still, the cost is legible. No reversal, simply deepening, sufficient for this lyric mode. Escalation is steady under Accumulative lens: each inhalation adds density until the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“recover lost motherhood hours”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when moonlight reveals the accumulation is a mirror, forcing the choice to cut and release. The escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for this length. Cost is palpable: blood on the cloth marks irreversible acceptance. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: open the locked dimension without violating pacifist code. Escalation is textural accumulation—each stitched photograph increases luminosity and narrows options until only transcendence remains. Agency is attention and endurance rather than violence; the cost is the irreversible severance from human gravity. No coincidence; grief materializes as literal passage.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—emerges early and tightens once: from walking with questions to the hush moment when she “could read the message clearly.” No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and cosmic. The release of bugs is the single decisive act that reweights meaning, showing visible price (light given away forever). Cost clarity is unmistakable; however, only one meaningful turn occurs, holding the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution—is signaled late (~200 words in) and never faces an on-page test or trade-off; escalation is a single linear step rather than a tightening. No credible price is dramatized: Elara risks nothing tangible (job, life, ally) in the moment of commitment, so the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding/solving the eels’ disappearance—narrows to the single irrevocable act of painting the Spiral, which costs her last star dust and forecloses all future attempts. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each rock placement intensifies pattern-density until the living geometry mirrors her design; coincidence is absent. Precog visions heighten cost rather than offering escape. Final stance crystallizes when she “slides but her mind holds the sequence firm,” a Charged Poise that visibly pays the price of irreversible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—voice vs. permanent silence—tightens when the storm strips away pretense and the sealed envelope becomes a live grenade she must either drop or hurl into language. One meaningful deepening: realizing she, not the censors, has held the pause. Cost is legible in the irreversible act of writing on mist, a medium that self-erases, trading permanence for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—knowledge as living process vs rigid doctrine—tightens when Varn redirects rather than wins, foreclosing the opponent’s certainty. Escalation is single-wave yet coherent under causal lens: each parry = counterargument, culminating in conceptual repricing. Cost is legible in the younger scholar’s dropped blade and dawning doubt. No off-stage resolution; agency remains Varn’s tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—create meaning inside a meaning-stripping place—is announced late but dramatized continuously through cataloguing, poem-planting, and whispered admissions. Tightening beat occurs when Mira decides to expose the hidden poems: risk of exposure vs. need to be witnessed; this narrows safety options. Cost is present (loss of anonymity, emotional vulnerability) though not materially compounded. Agency stays internal/artistic, fitting accumulative lens, hence high band but not apex.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can he honor Clara before horizon night claims the arbor—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative/image-driven: each paragraph thickens the spectral garden’s pull until the only remaining action is to play. No external antagonist; pressure is time-and-tide versus memory. Cost is visible: every extra minute risks missing the last train back or being stranded above clouds; the ending keeps that peril legible. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than decisive change, fitting the lens. One tightening: horizon invitation → climb → play; options narrow to a single bench at a cloud-piano.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim eroding collective memory—is signaled in paragraph two and intensifies by monsoon clock. No reversal occurs; pressure accumulates via sensory density and temporal contraction. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: loss of single-vessel control. Sufficient tightening for 800-word lyric arc, but lacks a visible trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: compass needle steadying over chest redefines the quest from outward search to inward acceptance. No external antagonist; escalation is textural deepening. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits reunion for internalized forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—stripping needless drama from perception—is signaled early and tightened when Mira confronts her own narrative imposition on cosmic data. The escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to witness rather than analyze, then returning to the site, where accumulated dust patterns reframe her understanding. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the intellectual satisfaction of explosive clarity for humility, crystallized in the realization that “neither [supernova nor butterfly] was more meaningful.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—is signaled early and deepens when frost patterns decode the ledger. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but deciphers the land. The cost is felt in lost art and solitude, though the final step lacks immediate peril. Pressure tightens meaningfully once, consistent with short-form expectations under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—translating lost music into survivable meaning—is signaled early and deepens in the performance hall, where Elara confronts the risk of being overwhelmed. Her agency lies in attention and endurance: she chooses to enter, lower her sensor, and reinterpret her mission. The cost is conceptual but legible—she surrenders the hope of restoring sound for a new mode of listening. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive intensification (the hall’s pulsing warmth) that reweights her entire project.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving permanent address to lost souls—is signaled early via the lens and deepens when Aldric enters the underwater library. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to listen, sit in the throne-chair, and help each soul release regrets. Cost is unmistakable: his lifelong ache fades only through labor that demands emotional vulnerability. Coincidence (the package) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns the lens’s restoration through work.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope amid erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s midnight runs and culminates in the bell’s declaration. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her quiet logistics evolve into public ritual, narrowing options (risking guard attention) for greater cohesion. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, hunger, and the ever-present threat of sanction enforcement. The final gathering crystallizes stance under pressure without resolving external conflict, honoring situational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—releasing unused love—is signaled early and deepens when Mei’s breath reveals the tendrils. Her agency drives escalation: positioning the apparatus, offering the tear, and syncing breath to mourning/acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: she metabolizes ancestral grief, altering her own physiology (“breathing catching like a phrase she could not finish”). The tightening forecloses mere observation, demanding sacrificial translation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving experiential time—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the photographs are retrocognitively trapped. The deepening comes via her understanding that the garden is a “machine for experiencing the texture of time,” which narrows her options to active creation. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she must shoulder her grandfather’s unfinished work. Escalation is driven by her agency—interpretation, then decision—not external force, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving genetic diversity against monocultural control—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses delayed planting over immediate action, accepting surveillance and soldier presence as necessary costs. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: decoding keys, tracing the sigil, descending despite chains. The tightening is meaningful: she forecloses the path of open rebellion to pursue covert resilience, with visible cost in her continued bondage and postponed hope. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s method of “collecting absences.” The escalation is driven by her agency: she forges prototypes, listens, interprets. Cost is unmistakable: biological clock ticking, David’s irreversible loss, the emotional toll of hearing love become memory. The tightening occurs not in plot but in perceptual focus, narrowing to the “tiny silences” that constitute betrayal—a deepening earned by her expertise and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making the invisible visible—is signaled early and deepens when Mira uses moonbeams to reveal the man’s alternate life. The tightening occurs at the lens-pour: a costly, irreversible act that narrows her role from observer to revealer. Agency is attention-as-action; her choice to develop the portrait forecloses anonymity. Cost is legible: empty jar, full camera, and the man’s altered posture—proof that seeing changes both seer and seen.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—crafting vessels where fragile questions can rest safely—is signaled early and deepens through the glassblower’s ritualized labor. The meaningful tightening occurs when he transfers the gather to the glory hole, an act of deliberate re-exposure to heat (risk) to regain pliability (openness). This escalation is driven by his agency, not coincidence, and carries visible cost: the acknowledgment that safety requires controlled vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through layered parallels (ice thawing, glass softening, heart un-freezing), culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses emotional isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity—is signaled early via the seashell’s revelation. Pressure tightens when Daniel appears, foreclosing retreat and forcing Maya to act immediately. The deepening occurs when she decodes the cast, transforming passive victimhood into active resistance. Cost is visible: her phobia claws at her throat even as she acts, and Daniel’s widened eyes confirm irreversible rupture. Escalation stems from Maya’s agency (choosing to read), not coincidence, though the shell’s activation feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mapping the coming darkness—is signaled early and tightens when the storm pauses, forcing immediate action. Agency lies in attention and creation, not combat; her choice to draw reconfigures survival itself. Cost is felt: her life ends as the map finishes. Escalation is driven by environmental pressure (storm, star fade), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical shift would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether consciousness can be continuous—is signaled early and deepens when the robot experiences recursive awareness in the third timeline loop. Agency drives escalation: choosing to return, to play, to listen. The tightening occurs when music replaces maintenance as necessary, foreclosing pure functionality. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the robot trades operational clarity for fluid, fragmented selfhood. Coincidence (the violin’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust in a post-linguistic world—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s symbolic ticket and the registrar’s mirrored response. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mira touches the registrar’s hand: a physical escalation that transcends the doodle system, raising emotional stakes. Protagonist agency drives this turn; the cost is the vulnerability of being seen. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation, while resonant, lacks a second tactical consequence beyond the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the garden’s integrity against commodification—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s quiet sabotage and ritual remembrance. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she redirects surveys, plants wildflowers, and refuses to assist the new seeker, each act narrowing options with visible cost (isolation, secrecy, burden of memory). The final beat crystallizes pressure: the maze will “reveal what it wishes,” reweighting human desire against natural wisdom. Coincidence never resolves; luck is measured, not relied upon.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens through Kira’s precise calibration of the nexus. The escalation is driven by her agency: each lever movement increases temporal bleed, culminating in simultaneous molt phases. Cost is legible: the emotional and intellectual weight of reshaping xenobiology, implied by her reflection on past sky vessels versus this “fundamental” truth. No coincidence resolves tension; the nexus responds only to her calibrated input. Slight deduction: the stakes remain conceptual without tangible personal risk beyond reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Marco’s code before the flood swallows it—is signaled early and tightens as water rises. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she interprets stains, moves to the piano, plays the score. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the flood is revelation, not destruction—a conceptual shift that reweights risk. Cost is felt: she risks drowning for a wordless conversation, and the piano’s submersion marks irreversible loss even as meaning is gained.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing the weight of predictive error—is signaled by 3:47 AM fever break and Elena’s ghost. Pressure tightens when the new system drops pressure, forcing Mira to act despite shattered certainty. Her agency drives escalation: touching the illustration isn’t passive remembrance but a tactile recalibration that enables her to type the forecast. Cost is legible: “heart finally light enough to do its work” implies prior burden was disabling; the storm’s arrival tests her reclaimed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—carrying a swallowed truth too heavy to bear alone—is signaled early and deepens through the ghost shift’s chorus of confessions. Pressure tightens when the valve wheel moves autonomously, forcing Marcus from observer to participant. Agency lies in his decision to speak, foreclosing continued silence with visible emotional cost. Coincidence (radio static) complicates but doesn’t resolve; escalation stems from protagonist’s drowsy surrender to the space’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the integrity of witnessing through non-intervention—is signaled early and deepens via the contrast between decay and silence. The tightening occurs when the keeper enters the refuge, where silence actively “mends fractures,” raising the cost of noise (i.e., judgment or action). Agency is passive but coherent under the Accumulative lens; however, the lack of a live alternative path slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—nurturing lifelong wonder—is signaled early and deepens via the eclipse’s progression, which narrows options to silence and presence. Elara’s agency lies in restraint: she lowers her ukulele, refuses to narrate, and trusts the moment. Cost is felt in the “familiar ache” of transience and the knowledge that this linking may be fleeting. However, pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than interpersonal; the children’s shifts are observed, not wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving dream-fragments before total silence—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam’s diary reveals dreams were literal fuel. Elias’s agency lies in attention and endurance: he chooses to probe deeper despite knowing prevention is impossible. The tightening occurs when comprehension dawns—“dreams had been drained to seal the breach”—foreclosing hope of restoration but elevating archival work to existential necessity. Cost is felt in the “held breath” silence and the irreversible tilt of reality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to re-engage with the old world of control or embrace prophetic surrender—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the official letter arrives. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he cooks the paper into paste, transforming potential return into irreversible refusal. The cost is conceptual and felt: he trades certainty for faith in currents, and the arrival of others proves his method works—but he remains apart, watching. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, yet the deepening reweights his entire existence with undeniable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden assumptions in possession—is signaled early and tightens when Gabriel’s scream reveals the entity’s “frustration,” not pain, reframing the conflict as negotiation, not battle. Matthias’s agency drives escalation: he deepens the chant, sharpens his questions, and advances with the palette. The cost is legible in the child’s suspended suffering and the priest’s solitary burden. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory and rhetorical density, not causal turns, culminating in a stance crystallization (entering the threshold armed with inquiry, not dogma).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering a fortune that reaches its destined recipient before Elira fragments—is signaled early and tightens at dawn. Agency manifests as attention and endurance: she maps memories not to predict but to permit, narrowing options through emotional resonance rather than action. Cost is felt in exhaustion and dissolution, though the escalation leans more textural than causal; the council’s pressure remains off-stage, slightly muting immediate opposition. Still, the deepening—merging grandmother’s kitchen with the spire—reweights stakes by fusing past and future into present urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—integration of fractured selves—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s descent into shadowed history. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to enter each fracture, paying the cost of reliving buried pain. The tightening occurs when she realizes wholeness requires embracing multiplicity, not escape. Cost is unmistakable: “she could never be whole,” yet she persists. Coincidence plays no role; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening that reconfigures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming emotional aliveness through non-auditory music—is signaled immediately and deepens through Maren’s agency: she chooses to wind the crank, place her palm, and stay for hours. The meaningful intensification occurs when she realizes numbness is “not a wall but a door,” foreclosing her old identity as a conventional music teacher. Cost is legible: she accepts permanent deafness yet gains a new pedagogy. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each backward song narrowing her conceptual options until only embodied presence remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional corruption—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes her data implicates the ministry. The tightening occurs when she connects weather anomalies to dumping schedules, transforming her from passive recorder to active resistor. Agency is clear: she chooses lateral movement over hiding, using obsolete systems as weapons. Cost is felt in the loss of safety and solitude, though not yet paid in blood—still legible as opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding grief through scent—is signaled early and deepens when the vial’s fragrance triggers the bloom’s transformation. Mirabel’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to uncork despite caution, accepting emotional risk. The cost is felt in her delayed, true grief and the vial’s emptiness. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory density rather than external opposition, culminating in a reconfiguration of what extinction means.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain human enough to document or join the transformation—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s pattern-drawing, which becomes both act of resistance and communion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each spiral repetition uncovers meaning that slips away, tightening the impossibility until the rope’s sudden luminescence forces crystallization. Cost is unmistakable: by choosing the threshold, she accepts perpetual liminality, losing full participation in either state. The energy beings’ silent presence applies ethical pressure without resolving conflict; coincidence never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unbinding trapped grief through music—is signaled early and tightens when the chronic hush initially swallows her notes. Agency is clear: Marina chooses to play despite silence, and her persistence alters the environment (bowl vibrates, echo returns). Cost is felt in the “raw and searching” tone and the acknowledgment that the rainforest “could not be unburned.” Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure curve lacks a second meaningful deepening beyond the initial acoustic failure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether genuine empathy can be manufactured—is signaled early and tightened through Vera’s self-experimentation, which forecloses the option of remaining purely detached. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to inhale the compound, triggering the fusion of insight and feeling. Cost is unmistakable: she pays with real grief, and the price is visible in how it “rearranges the furniture of her interior world.” The pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory and emotional density rather than external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—recognizing invisible labor—is signaled early and deepens when Maren chooses to pursue the envelope rather than discard it. This single act of attention narrows her path from detached broker to active connector, with the cost being emotional vulnerability and responsibility. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; the “tightening” is internal but decisive. While coincidence delivers the envelope, Maren’s agency drives every subsequent move, fulfilling the Situational/Accumulative escalation standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging through reciprocity—is signaled early and tightens at the arbor: Yara must choose between repeating her draining generosity or risking vulnerability. The deepening comes via Corwin’s warning (“approach honestly”), which raises cost—truth as a “blade.” Agency drives escalation: her decision to kneel unarmed (only reeds, hands, hope) triggers the vision. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the Threader’s reveal is earned by her honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the city’s stolen rhythm—is signaled early and deepens as Sera realizes she must “borrow time” from the giant’s dream. The tightening occurs when she understands the pendant is a tool for sculpting time, forcing a trade-off: intervene at personal risk or let silence persist. Cost is legible in the sustained tension of “stealing fragments” without waking the giant. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss through emotional mathematics—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when the glass eyes transform the orchard into unanswerable questions. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: purchasing the eyes, pressing them to her sockets, then relinquishing them. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her instrumental approach, accepting that “understanding might not be the point.” Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the entire premise without coincidence or external interference.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making the unseen seen through care—is signaled early and deepens when the tape fragment reframes Maren’s purpose. Escalation is driven by her agency: she investigates, interprets, and transmits. Cost is unmistakable: her fulfillment comes not from being seen but from knowing her presence guides others invisibly. The outage creates urgency, but resolution stems from her character, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to uproot herself—is signaled early and deepens when the grant letter arrives, making retirement feel like betrayal of her life’s work. The meaningful tightening occurs when Vera stops trying to “solve” the vines’ damage and instead sees their adaptive growth, which shifts her internal calculus. Cost is unmistakable: she risks vulnerability with Sarah, admitting her fear of becoming “unrecognizable.” Agency drives escalation—her observation leads to surrender, not external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from experience—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s deteriorating body and sharpening focus on the telescope as a tool for revelation. The exchange is a decisive deepening: she trades ancestral warmth (brooch) for future clarity (telescope), narrowing her options to one final act—sleep. Cost is felt in her "haggard awe" and physical collapse. Agency is consistent: she follows rain trails, initiates the trade, and chooses rest. No coincidence resolves tension; the stranger’s generosity is earned by mutual recognition of hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Varen’s need to validate his clairvoyance—is signaled early and deepens when the pearls reflect only his face, foreclosing his old certainty. The escalation is protagonist-driven: his choice to listen rather than see reshapes his relationship to time. Cost is felt conceptually (loss of prophetic authority) and emotionally (humility replacing pride). Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered through the cave’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing lost meaning—is signaled early and tightens when Sera’s box triggers visions that culminate in understanding the valve’s purpose. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his choice to engage fragments deepens pressure until the valve’s vision reweights exile’s silence. Cost is felt in his solitude and the exiles’ burdened return, though a sharper trade-off (e.g., sacrificing another relic to grasp the valve) would elevate this further. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his reactively visionary trait.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when cracks shift dynamically, forcing Aria to trust patterns over control. Cost is felt in her trembling and ultimate vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: she chooses east, speaks aloud. However, the “phantom ticket” resolving truth-spelling leans on coincidence, slightly undercutting earned pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether empirical truth or ancestral resonance—tightens decisively when Mira transcribes the tile, shifting from documentation to co-creation. The cost is conceptual: she relinquishes the safety of detached measurement for vulnerable contribution (“add her voice to the chorus”). Agency drives escalation—her choice to transcribe, not chance, unlocks memory. However, the external pressure remains atmospheric rather than interpersonal, slightly limiting tactical complexity; still, internal stakes escalate with lyrical inevitability under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the nature of goodbye—is signaled early and deepens through the solar storm’s arrival, which narrows options to a single decisive moment. Pressure coheres accumulatively: magnetic fields intensify, space tears, and the amulet pulses in sync with Elian’s heart. The cost is felt in three millennia of carrying a curse without comprehension, now released into vision. Agency lies in Elian’s choice to raise the amulet; coincidence (the storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he must still be ready.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether honesty can function as resistance in a rigged system—is signaled early and tightens when Darius appears. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to write, not forge; to argue, not con. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes rigid systems (bureaucratic and paternal) can “liquefy” under genuine intention. Cost is unmistakable: she risks exposure, yet gains no personal reward—only the fragile currency of hope, paid forward. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens, with each choice narrowing her path toward ethical action over passive compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—deciphering why the town went silent—is signaled early and deepens when the hum “curved upward like a question.” Elara’s agency lies in her methodical attention, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs in the shift of frequency, narrowing possibilities toward revelation. Cost is felt: seven years of solitude, the weight of silence, the burden of being the sole witness. No coincidence resolves tension; the escalation is earned through disciplined observation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—constructing counter-history against state erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the label appears, tightening the protagonist’s resolve. Agency manifests through attention and preservation, not action; the meaningful deepening occurs when the dockworker’s story reweights the label from relic of despair to evidence of endurance. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: living as “nameless” to evade bureaucratic death. Coincidence (tide exposing the label) complicates but doesn’t resolve—interpretation remains the protagonist’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the hum—is signaled early and deepens into a personal reckoning with unsaid words. The tightening occurs when each hum forces Elena to confront avoided conversations, narrowing her options from investigation to introspection. Agency is clear: she chooses to keep touching the strings, escalating emotional exposure. Cost is felt in her trembling and the irreversible loss of her debunker’s certainty, which charges the final stance. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems entirely from her choices within the observatory’s charged space.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping gentrification rather than surrendering—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s active reorganization. The tightening occurs when she chooses resurrection of the old language over direct confrontation, narrowing options to covert mobilization. Cost is legible: she absorbs the weight of responsibility, and the community risks exposure. Agency is clear—her decisions drive the escalation, and coincidence (investors’ arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last untouched frost—is signaled early and deepens as solar exposure looms. Pressure escalates texturally: the “dawning hush” gives way to “harsh clarity,” narrowing Mira’s window and forcing precision. Her agency lies in attention and timing; the cost is conceptual (irreversible loss) and personal (carrying Yusuf’s legacy). The single tightening—sunrise approaching—forecloses delay, and her choice to use antiquated chemical methods (not digital) embodies thematic trade-offs. Coincidence never resolves; every move stems from her obsession, and the price—bearing witness to vanishing beauty—is unmistakable in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering a vital package before dawn departure—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking anchor lift. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his unique water-refraction method diagnoses then repairs the drone’s navigational failure. The meaningful deepening occurs when he transforms “garbled signals into a clear path,” altering the drone’s fate through skilled attention. Cost is felt in his solitary return to the bench—a life of enabling others’ connections while rooted in place—made visible in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating the convergence against institutional skepticism—is signaled early and tightens when the falcon returns with foreign symbol and alpine leaf. Miriam’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers, cross-references, and trusts her embodied knowledge over official charts. Cost is felt in professional isolation and the “worrying tranquility” that frames imminent discovery. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false resolutions or coincidental fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reviving Vellachen to heal the regional “wound”—is signaled early and escalates through embodied cost: stamina depletion, fork warming from use, precise count of footsteps. The tightening is structural (7,000 repetitions → 2,000 left) and sensory (first buzz in boots), narrowing options to persistence alone. Agency is crystallized in attention and endurance, not grand action, fitting the Accumulative lens. Coincidence never resolves; progress is earned through cumulative pressure, with moral calculus embedded in interdependence (“cities… interconnected as roots”).

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty against time—is signaled early via grandmother’s warning and deepens when perfume triggers ancestral memories. Marina’s agency drives escalation: overriding instinct, unscrewing vial, unsnarling gears. Cost is unmistakable: she trades breath, self, and future for eternal repository status. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via rising sensory density and irreversible commitment, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring a stolen ending—is signaled early and escalates through Marcus’s deliberate self-incarceration. The tightening occurs when he steps through the scuffed door: a point of no return that transforms him from prisoner to prophet. Agency is clear: he chooses speech over silence, knowing the village will soon seek absolution he may deny. Cost is felt in the “stone in his chest” and the irreversible assumption of his father’s burden, now made active rather than passive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repaying the debt through “loving service”—is signaled early and tightens when the struggling scions suddenly thrive, forcing the transfer of responsibility. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her cameo appearances and ghost-touch are deliberate payments, culminating in the hand-on-glass moment that narrows her options to near-release. Cost is unmistakable: the gardener inherits both blessing and curse, tears welling with “ancient grief and older joy.” Coincidence never resolves; growth is earned through spectral labor.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin into reverence through path-stitching—is signaled early and deepens via Maren’s nightly ritual. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each stitch adds luminosity, leading to the climactic border around the spring. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: she forgoes return to the coast, dedicating herself to a land that “knew only loss.” Agency is clear—her sewing is the sole engine of change—and the final image reweights the canyon’s meaning without coincidence or external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring continuity severed by war—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to stay after the team abandons the wing. Her agency drives escalation: purposeful wandering yields discovery, which demands rebuilding, which culminates in ritual reinstallation. Cost is felt in forfeited time (two pandemic years, great-aunt’s death) and emotional vulnerability, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of ceremonial knowledge sufficiently reweights stakes without requiring physical antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether handwritten words can breach digital erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Maren crafts “Vesper Lane” to bypass memory filters. Escalation occurs through her agency: reviewing chalk codes, deciding the letter needs “white space” truth, adding the postscript. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she invests her “carefully inventive hope” in a system that may discard it, foreclosing easier paths (digital contact). The tightening (dawn approaching) forces the final choice, and the stake remains viscerally felt through tactile details (clipboard, chalk, ink).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing erased truths before the coup—is signaled early and tightens as Elara reads the southern generals’ alliance. Pressure escalates through her perception shift (“synchronized with that flame”), narrowing options to intervention via embroidery. Cost is felt: she endures silence, carries suppressed voices, risks exposure. Agency is quiet but decisive—her stitching alters the conspiracy’s fate.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with an unchangeable past—is signaled early and tightened when the window commands “Come back… to the moment before deciding.” Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the glass, to evoke memory, to stay until dawn. The cost is felt in her trembling, her tears, and the irreversible fact that her sister is dead—yet the price of self-forgiveness becomes possible. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off: not undoing, but integrating.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into testimony—tightens when Elira deciphers Fatima’s hidden narrative, narrowing options from passive recovery to active witnessing. Agency is clear: her linguistic expertise forces a moral choice (to voice the unspeakable), paid for in emotional labor (“throat catching”). Cost is visible in her “ache” and the coral’s symbolism. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic joy—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s light projection unexpectedly revives the dancer, drawing the community. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to project, layer light, and persist despite years of creative hollowness. The cost is visible: the fresco gives its last color, and Mira’s joy is tinged with awareness of impermanence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can lost meaning be restored or only continued?—tightens when the nickel alters the garden’s acoustics, forcing Elena to abandon her original methodology. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to listen rather than impose, accepting the cost of uncertainty. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density (sound layering, pattern recognition) until the final beat crystallizes a new stance. Coincidence (finding the nickel) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her response earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving untaxable thought—is signaled early and tightens when Maren plants the last seed of the “Untaxable Lineage.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the convergence point, where her choice forecloses safety (she’s now a target) but affirms resistance. Cost is legible in her posture (“tenderness of a mother guarding first words”) and the ever-present drone threat. While escalation is subtle, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens: density of coded detail intensifies until the seed’s burial crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reaching the absent beloved through poetry—is signaled early and deepens when the postcard trembles, escalating her output. The tightening is textual, not causal: poems become “tendrils… roots… blossom armistice,” narrowing her expression into urgent botanical metaphors. Cost is felt (centuries of wakefulness, taffy-stretched longing) but remains abstract; no tangible forfeiture occurs. Agency lies in endurance, yet the escalation lacks a decisive trade-off that alters her material reality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving names from total forgetting—is signaled early and deepens through the caretaker’s nightly rounds, each pause narrowing options to endurance alone. Agency manifests as attention and ritual; the meaningful tightening occurs when she accepts that progress demands forgetting, yet chooses preservation anyway. Cost is felt in “foxglove regret” and “familiar ache,” and the final image confirms foreclosed paths: she will repeat this work eternally. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth and trust through linguistic fidelity—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the language died because it demanded unflinching honesty. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to write despite risk forecloses continued isolation and forces reconciliation. Cost is unmistakable: three years of severed collaboration, the weight of extinct voices, and vulnerability in facing Elian. The tightening occurs in her decision to begin, which narrows options from study to enactment, altering relational dynamics irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding her father’s encrypted compassion to determine whether to continue his dangerous work—is signaled early and tightens when the volcano’s tremors intensify, forcing immediacy. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes his disappearance was protective, not abandonment, altering her understanding of love and duty. Agency is clear: her analysis drives the turn, not coincidence. Cost is felt in her acceptance of ongoing peril—“the dormant volcano would not remain dormant forever”—a price embedded in the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to trust messages again—is signaled early and deepens through Eleanor’s scientific-emotional method. Agency drives escalation: she chooses stillness, maps motes, reconstructs sound, all narrowing her world to one fragile act of faith. The cost is felt in the abandoned aviary and the “fading” voice, which crystallizes the trade-off between preservation and connection. No coincidence resolves tension; the Echo Project’s revelation tightens rather than solves.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some thresholds are sacred—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the weather codes are coordinates, not predictions. Her agency drives escalation: she interprets the grain, deciphers the logbook’s true function, and chooses to step onto solid ground. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: the loss of intuitive connection to her mother, replaced by hard-won, pattern-based understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and deepens through Marek’s confrontation with the researchers’ failed calculus. The tightening occurs when he places the feather beside the amber, triggering resonance that reconfigures isolation into kinship. The live clock (“until sunrise”) raises stakes, and the cost is legible: the facility’s imminent flood renders his act transient, yet meaningful. Agency lies in attention and witness, not action—a valid form under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the son’s path before memory fades—is signaled early and deepens when gaps appear. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she pushes past the fisher’s sorrow into “currents that connected father and son,” forcing a costly reconfiguration of hope. The “curtain” gap introduces high-pressure ambiguity, and her choice to interpret absence as transformation (not death) carries emotional risk. Coincidence (the bird’s seeds) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution emerges from her disciplined conjecture.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—making the predictable feel miraculous—is signaled early and deepened through Marek’s choreography of chance. Pressure escalates subtly: from solitary preparation to audience arrival, each interaction tightens the illusion. The meaningful deepening occurs when the couple smiles at the “accident,” confirming his method works—but also trapping him in it. Cost is conceptual: he must endlessly perform this calculus, forever tethered to the margins. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internalized in the tension between control and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—penning a cosmic verse that outlasts the nostalgia ban—is signaled early and deepens through the tide dancer’s agency: she chooses observation over command, breath over speech, touch over distance. The tightening occurs when she lifts the moonstone and exhales, transforming memory into ink—a trade-off that forecloses her return to the sea. Cost is legible: “anchor within her dissolve like salt in rain.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—seeing clearly in a world that settles for opacity—is signaled early and deepened through the ripple ritual and prism atrium. Escalation occurs via sensory intensification (darkness → dawn, stillness → rings → engine sound), not plot turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is subtle but present: her isolation, the unacknowledged depth of her insight. A tighter link between her internal practice and an external consequence would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating private pain into communal resilience—is signaled early and deepened through Mira’s annual ritual. The tightening occurs when she opens the box and chooses to speak, not to mourn but to train others, narrowing her path from solitary survivor to mentor. Agency is clear: her decision to carry Elena’s legacy forward forecloses retreat into silence. Cost is felt in the spiderwebbed mirror and the admission that “we do… what makes us break.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding hope’s dynamics—is clear early, but escalation is textual, not causal: more balloons, more observations, not higher-risk decisions. No timeline forces Elara to abandon a core belief or tool; failure is acknowledged but not viscerally confronted. The “deepening” is intellectual, not existential—the cost of flawed equations remains abstract, never materializing as lost time, broken trust, or physical consequence that alters her tactics in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving what walls dream—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to interpret Ashworth’s blurred text despite decay and cold. The meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers his echo chart, transforming her task from recovery to continuation. Cost is felt in physical chill and emotional isolation, though the escalation leans more on revelation than tactical narrowing. Still, under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift toward communal dreaming reweights stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—awakening mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and deepens through Aria’s coded lullaby, which narrows her options to precise sonic frequencies. The escalation is textural: as her song syncs with the borrowed heartbeat, mirrors “stir” and reveal alternate realities, each tied to suppressed hope. Cost is legible—not physical loss, but the emotional weight of carrying forgotten dreams and the perpetual transience of her own existence. Her agency is total; no coincidence resolves tension. The tightening occurs when the villa’s mirrors respond, foreclosing any generic approach—only *this* melody in *this* place works.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether fragile trust can outlive generational bloodshed—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s confession and the naming of the dead. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses vulnerability over proposal, turning grief into method. The cost is felt in every line—Varen’s buried sons, Sera’s vow of vengeance—and crystallizes in the handshake’s “beat too long,” a visible price paid for even tentative connection. No coincidence resolves tension; pressure tightens purely through human choice under the indifferent stars.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting lost song—is signaled early and deepens through her admission of “manufactured drought” and sacrificed relationships. Escalation is driven by her agency: diverting rivers, timing storms, placing the egg. The tightening occurs when she chooses release over control, accepting that survival is out of her hands. Cost is unmistakable: moral condemnation, loneliness, and the risk of total failure. Coincidence complicates (thunder) but doesn’t resolve; the drought she engineered creates the only possible conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving inner selfhood against institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightened through the act of untangling echoes, which narrows her path from passive endurance to active release. Each thread freed raises the cost of compliance, culminating in a stance crystallization: “the lullaby… could not reach her.” Though external pressure is diffuse (the palace as system), the internal conflict escalates credibly via protagonist agency—her patience becomes rebellion. The felt cost is her irreversible isolation, rendered in the “alarming serenity” of her departure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ethical responsibility in storytelling—is signaled early via Mira’s accusation and deepens when Elias reverses narrative direction. His agency drives escalation: choosing backward-telling is a high-risk tactic that narrows options to either complicity or renunciation. Cost is unmistakable in the stick left behind, symbolizing surrendered authorial control. Coincidence (meteor streak) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from his action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—providing shelter for the last monarch as an act of historical witness—is signaled early and deepens when the gust threatens both butterfly and signal. Elara’s improvisation (knotting the rescue structure) narrows options: she abandons preservation for intervention, paying the cost of destroyed prior work. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; escalation arises from protagonist agency (hands finding cords, urgent knotting). Coincidence (the gust) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the monarch’s descent results from Elara’s precise, earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving names against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through Yara’s reweaving of the rope. Escalation is driven by her agency: she decodes the card, reconfigures braids, and accepts the cost of remembrance. The tightening occurs when she realizes transcription alone is insufficient; memory must be *carried*. Cost is felt in numb fingers and aching joints, yet purpose burns clear.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the threshold before the directive decays—is signaled early and tightens via the storm’s approach. Foresight’s agency lies in interpretation, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens, but escalation hinges on external timing (nightfall) more than her choices. The cost—losing ancestral knowledge—is felt conceptually, though not viscerally dramatized. Still, the deepening from protocol to emotional cartography credibly narrows her path to transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving hidden order amid regime collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Maruk realizes prior astronomers failed their duty. His agency drives escalation: deciphering schematics, risking ritual, speaking the incantation. Cost is unmistakable: he assumes a sacred burden others ignored, with no guarantee of personal safety. The “dusky accord” reconfigures power itself, granting the new rulers unearned favor they cannot comprehend.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment to restore harmony—is signaled early and deepens when Kael admits envy. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she chooses nonviolence, leverages cellular memory, and forces confrontation in a dissolving world. The tightening occurs when Kael’s form steadies briefly—curiosity overriding bitterness—narrowing his options toward vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: Kael must publicly confess lifelong resentment, sacrificing his grievance-based identity for reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recreating a fugitive dream—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s nocturnal labor. The tightening occurs when she chooses to embed the sextant’s shards into the mirror, narrowing her options to one fragile synthesis. Agency is clear: her synchronized breathing and mounting of the mirror are decisive acts under pressure. Cost is felt: she trades personal reflection for an external vision, and the orchard’s “forgetting” echoes the astronomer’s loss—both stakes converge in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing a broken vow—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s realization that skill alone is insufficient. The meaningful tightening occurs when she admits her pride prevented seeking help, foreclosing the path of solitary mastery. Cost is legible: lost years with her daughter, embodied in the ribbon and the daughter’s halted reach. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the daughter’s arrival introduces slight external resolution pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing forbidden ancestral knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when Mira asks the right question, triggering irreversible change. Agency is clear: her inquiry, not coincidence, activates the cameo. The cost is felt as “brightened disquiet,” a permanent shift in understanding. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: each layer of inheritance lore tightens the thematic coil until the final luminescent payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—renegotiating the broken bargain to recover unlearned lessons—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the council’s true request. The meaningful deepening occurs in the nautilus chamber, where she grasps that the time traveler’s error was offering probabilistic futures instead of tangible sacrifice. Agency is clear: Elara shifts from cataloging gaps to composing a new language of loss. Cost is conceptual but felt: she must embrace absence as a mode of knowing, which the final descent embodies. One minor slip: the “disturbances” remain abstract rather than manifesting as tangible obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recapturing what memory cannot hold—is signaled early and deepens when the card’s glow intensifies at the thought of the garden. The meaningful tightening occurs as the ship turns and the fog lifts, altering Mira’s perception: her brother’s voice shifts from echo to conversation. Yet the escalation leans on atmospheric change rather than protagonist-driven agency; Mira reacts more than acts. Cost is felt (enduring duality) but not visibly paid in a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—translating historical confusion into clarity—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s realization that absence is “waiting for the right hands.” The tightening occurs when she merges the braids, narrowing options from speculation to irrevocable action. Cost is conceptual but legible: accessing Vane’s hidden archive means confronting deliberately forgotten history, with implied institutional consequences. Agency is fully hers; no coincidence resolves the mystery. Only slight deduction for the lack of tangible personal risk beyond intellectual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding silence to save survivors—is signaled early and tightens when the stone hums, narrowing options to one precise location. The spiral crack deepens knowledge, and Mira’s breath-tone act is a high-stakes gamble with irreversible cost: if failed, no other blooms may exist. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. The energy beings’ rules (cannot enter silence) create coherent pressure, and the bloom’s fragility raises the price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the prism’s “shard of hush” reframes the beacon’s purpose from navigation to communion. Pressure escalates through Elara’s retrocognitive activation and the anomalous hum, culminating in her midnight ascent plan. Agency is clear: she chooses interpretation over resignation. Yet the escalation leans on internal realization more than external constraint, and the cost (“heart ache,” “fragile hope”) feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid; no tool is lost, no time forfeited, no rival pressure tested.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory before it scatters—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s realization that monuments can distort as much as preserve. The meaningful tightening occurs when she discerns the one monument that “remembered grief accurately,” forcing a micro-choice: to record this truth. Cost is conceptual but legible: her work is necessary precisely because memory is fragile and often falsified. Escalation is driven by her agency (conjecture via shadow-reading), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: no tangible forfeiture (time, tool, social capital) alters tactics visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying the gravity of hopelessness—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reads the mosaic note, which transforms her wandering into purposeful ritual. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her preparation deepens from habit to consecration, culminating in the spiral that “rises despite gravity.” Cost is felt in the weight of expectation (villagers stirring only after ignition) and the fragility of one small light. Slight deduction: the atmospheric disturbance remains unexplained, but this serves thematic ambiguity rather than weakens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding fractured kinship—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s realization that the argument itself is a “tidal zone.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses indirect communication (the cicada offering) over verbal confrontation, narrowing options but raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt in the bodily tension and historical silence; agency lies in attention and endurance, not grand action. Escalation is driven by Mira’s internal shift, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redefining freedom vs. safety—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes limitation can mean “limiting exposure to fear.” The sprout’s emergence and the doll’s pulse serve as tightening beats that narrow her options: she must choose between her father’s prison or this fragile, open growth. Cost is felt in her return to the bunker, yet the hour’s gift alters her future trajectory. Agency drives escalation—she climbs, collects silence, reinterprets limitation—though the gravity shift’s mechanics remain unexplained, slightly softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s tactical choices: extending the route, uncorking the vial, humming the resonant frequency. Agency is clear: she acts despite the boy’s passivity, and each decision narrows options (e.g., using the post-whistle hush). The cost is felt in her solitude and the boy’s obliviousness; her success is invisible, yet the storm glass’s shift proves impact. Pressure accumulates texturally, not through external opposition, but via internalized professional and ancestral duty.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—claiming the throne as custodian, not ruler—is signaled early and deepens when murals reveal it as a “gift” requiring surrender of certainty. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her methodical peeling uncovers truth, and her refusal to rush despite dawn’s approach embodies the core trade-off (patience over urgency). Cost is legible: she forfeits lifelong scholarly distance to become guardian, paid in the final ascent. Coincidence (midnight alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the stairway manifests only through her precise, earned actions.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to maintain absolute isolation or risk reconnection—is signaled early and deepens when the “encroachment” manifests as her former self. The tightening occurs when she recognizes isolation as “slow suffocation,” foreclosing the path of total withdrawal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to open the door arises from earned insight, not coincidence. Cost is felt in the final act: stepping into the “suffocating breath” of the world implies renewed vulnerability as necessary oxygen.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can a promise be trusted?—tightens when Maya chooses to walk in despite knowing exploitation tactics. The escalation is protagonist-driven: she reads the text aloud, brings the bolt, enters alone. Cost is felt early (“forty-seven messages deleted”) and crystallizes at climax: witnessing requires enduring the memory of her own gullibility. The quantum promise doesn’t resolve externally; it reweights internal stakes—risk becomes worth taking *because* she knows the price.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can confront the truth of her lineage—is signaled early and deepens when the gramophone defies expectation. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to turn the crank, activating the mechanism. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: the family’s legacy was already broken, and her role shifts from inheritor to witness. The “first yawn of evening” tightens the window, implying the revelation is time-bound and fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning through abandoned possibility—is signaled early and deepens when Aldric reads the program aloud. His agency drives escalation: manipulating strings reactivates dormant magic, culminating in release. The cost is visible: the greenhouse fades, and he walks into “endless night” no longer alone—a Charged Poise where loss and gain coexist. Pressure tightens once, sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased humanity against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the button reveals a hidden thread of wartime kindness. Pressure escalates through accumulation, not external conflict, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes her role isn’t neutral but devotional, foreclosing detachment. Cost is felt in the burden of witness, though not physically dramatized beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against historical erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the audit forces Mira from passive archivist to active fugitive. The meaningful deepening occurs at the lagoon: discovery of the full archive transforms endurance into agency. Cost is unmistakable: safety for exposure, invisibility for visibility. Escalation is driven by Mira’s choices (using grandmother’s map, wading to stones), not external luck, under coherent regime pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing the prophecy through sound—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: he answers rising whispers with precise tonal countermeasures. The meaningful tightening occurs when a phrase breaks through, forcing him to “shatter the fragment,” which visibly exhausts him and deepens the cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in a Charged Poise where silence is both victory and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding ancestral truth—is signaled early and deepens when prophecy replaces memory. The tightening occurs when Seraphina identifies the drought and forgotten seed, narrowing her path to action. Agency is shown through her descent to the vault, a physical commitment with implied cost: she now bears the burden of foresight. The escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral (e.g., no personal sacrifice beyond transformed self).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering the compass to deny Elias’s death—is signaled early and deepens through the lighthouse keeper’s letter, which transforms rumor into tangible location. Pressure escalates via environmental obstacles (collapsed wall, broken panes, ash-covered stairs) that demand physical commitment, not coincidence. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maren chooses descent despite vagueness, trading surface safety for subterranean risk. Cost is implied (isolation, potential futility) but not yet paid on-page; under Accumulative lens, this suffices, though a sharper tactical consequence (e.g., losing a tool, injury) would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding her brother’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses kintsugi over conventional repair, foreclosing her old path of “measured work.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each handling of the coin deepens her insight. Cost is unmistakable—the luminous regret, the admission of wasted years—and charges the final image. No coincidence resolves tension; all pressure arises from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—helping souls laugh before release—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses absurdity over solemnity. Pressure escalates texturally: mist → confession → music → laughter. The tightening occurs when she sings the milk-from-nose anecdote, narrowing options from ritual to intimate storytelling. Cost is felt in Mira’s unhealed wound, though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than protagonist-driven causality, slightly limiting agency under a strict Causal lens—but fits Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to flee her complicity or face it—is signaled early and tightens decisively when she chooses not to remove the beacon-like strap. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: her walk becomes an act of endurance that forecloses the path of numbness. Cost is unmistakable in “price she had not yet calculated” and the trembling body at the clearing’s edge. Under the Accumulative lens, each sensory and mnemonic layer deepens the moral weight without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating the in-between—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes they are not preserving history but becoming its conduit. The tightening occurs when the alchemist identifies the Keeper, forcing a shift from passive custodian to active inheritor. Agency is crystallized in the unfastening of the coat—a small act with monumental consequence. Cost is felt in the surrender of old self-conception, rendered visible in the fragment’s new placement against the heart.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering what was hidden above the ceiling—is signaled early via dust anomalies and intensifies through tactile engagement (brushing debris, feeling temperature drop). Pressure escalates texturally: silence → presence → visible shape → actionable hatch. Marcus’s agency drives deepening; his choice to climb (not inspect the elevator shaft) forecloses safety for revelation. Cost is felt in the “weightless burden” made literal—he inherits another’s unresolved story, with no guarantee of resolution, only responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to contain or release compressed time—is signaled early via the frost’s “bottle” syntax and tightens when Elara chooses the press over preservation. Escalation is driven by her agency: following frost, placing bottle in platen, accepting expansion. Cost is unmistakable—the Library’s systems destabilize, her personal timeline compresses, and the orchard shudders. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through pattern breaks (frost shattering) and cadence shifts (syllabic cascade), reweighting silence into sound.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling historical truth with civilizational identity—tightens when the storm forces Vespera to choose between exposure and protection. Her agency drives escalation: devising mirror-covering protocols, then implementing them under pressure. The cost is legible in her burnished sorrow and the council’s initial ridicule; the storm’s revelation exacts emotional toll while affirming her method. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Vespera’s preparedness earns the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light through mending intangible songs—is signaled early and deepens through Cassian’s realization that “some wounds existed in the space between sounds.” The tightening occurs when he tethers moonlight to the orchestrion, risking failure after decades of preparation. Cost is unmistakable: partial success, not full restoration, and the enduring weight of the covenant. Agency is clear—this act is his alone, earned by lifetime of honest labor.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching the place “where explanations fail”—tightens decisively when the compass points “not north but down,” forcing physical delving. Agency is clear: Elara chooses descent despite risk, and her final stillness is active renunciation. Cost is felt in irreversible isolation (“She would not return”) and the forfeiture of her life’s work (the uncorked vial captures nothing). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each collected petrichor intensifies the hunger for origin.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding one’s place in a lineage of makers—is signaled early and deepens when the slide reveals historical figures. The storm intensifies pressure, forcing Aria into the archway where the decisive insight occurs. Agency is clear: she chooses to interpret the slide, then to carve anew. Cost is conceptual but felt: her solitary artistry is subsumed into a chain of hands, altering her future work irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom unseen—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated observation. Pressure escalates via seasonal transition (autumn to winter’s end) and perceptual refinement (frost patterns, light angles), culminating in the window’s revelation. The cost is conceptual: months of solitude, unanswered questions, and the surrender of decorative art for essential truth. Agency is intellectual rather than physical, which slightly softens the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to erased history—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam deciphers the diary’s truth. The tightening occurs at the lagoon: choosing to engage the parley forecloses anonymity, binding her to ancestral duty. Agency is clear—she walks alone, reads the cipher, stays as the apparition rises. Cost is felt: “searing mixture of grief and wonder” becomes lifelong burden. Coincidence (lagoon’s unmapped appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Voss merely points, never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding civilization without wishes—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s renunciation of comfort. Agency lies in his deliberate use of working memory, which forecloses magical shortcuts with felt cost: “he had no intention of remaining wounded.” Pressure escalates texturally as memories coalesce into form, narrowing options to remembrance alone. The child’s laugh embodies the stake’s transformation—from loss to possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—filling the foghorn’s silence with meaningful sound—is signaled early and deepens when Seraphine realizes the dead’s oaths are already arriving. The tightening occurs when she chooses immersion over passive waiting, narrowing options to one path: listening. Cost is felt as “velvet disquiet,” the burden of being the sole receiver. Agency is clear: her action (pressing wax to temple) triggers the revelation. Coincidence complicates (rust, redundancy) but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from her inherited readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving temporal inheritance through decreasing entropy—tightens decisively when Elara chooses to open herself, reversing disorder at personal cost. Agency drives escalation: her decades of practice enable the ritual, and her choice to invite (not force) the vortex deepens stakes. The price—absorbing seven generations of failed seeds’ entropy—is felt in her “embers refusing to die” chest. Coincidence never resolves; everything stems from her lineage and will.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ensuring the siren works before zero hour—is clear early and tightens when microclimate shifts confirm the storm’s approach. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she checks instruments, interprets data, and initiates the test sequence. The cost is temporal and existential: if she fails, thirty thousand remain unwarned. Though pressure builds atmospherically rather than through interpersonal conflict, the narrowing window and rising humidity create coherent, causally grounded tension under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—witnessing the overlooked—is signaled early and deepens when the janitor chooses slow communion over collection. The tightening occurs at the fragment discovery: instead of routine cleanup, they kneel, refracting light into narrative. This agency-driven deepening reweights the entire premise: maintenance becomes sacred empathy. Cost is felt in the “strange peace of no longer having to burn”—a vulnerability the janitor honors at personal emotional risk. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via cadence shift from observation to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken covenants—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost gestures toward the buried box. Mira’s agency lies in attention and acceptance, not action; her choice to dig and receive fulfills the covenant with visible cost. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No false resolution: the ghost fades only after Mira assumes responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding time’s texture versus its measurement—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s engagement with the urn fragment. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from seeking answers to accepting the fragment’s broken honesty, foreclosing the path of repair in favor of witness. Cost is conceptual (abandoning chronology’s comfort) and felt (“settling into her chest like something that had always been there”). Agency is internal but credible; however, external pressure is minimal, slightly softening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and tightens when the poet binds feather to kite, foreclosing functional repair for symbolic gesture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: tending leads to harmonizing discord, which crystallizes into thematic stance. Cost is unmistakable: the missing string renders flight impossible, yet the poet chooses meaning over utility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving and restoring the orchard’s hidden architecture—is signaled early and intensified by the six-month deadline. The meaningful deepening occurs when Maren shifts from observation to active remodeling, understanding the builders’ intentional design. Her agency drives escalation: she climbs, wraps, interprets. The cost—foregoing rest for labor, accepting she won’t witness completion—is felt in bodily weakness and quiet resignation. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens through her own choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s renunciation of academic safety. The meaningful tightening occurs when she lifts the amber and recognizes the universal pilgrimage, foreclosing a return to old skepticism. Cost is felt (reputation lost, solitude embraced), though escalation relies more on reflection than external pressure, slightly softening the causal thrust under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reversing ecological death through memory—is signaled early and deepens when birds return with “news of a gardener.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the coachman plants the pod, shifting from witness to actor. Agency is clear: his action, not coincidence, triggers the reef’s response. Cost is felt (decades of silence, the burden of being the sole mediator) but could be sharper—what does he forfeit by acting? Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the brother’s message—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist shifts from auditory to tactile reading. The tightening forecloses prior methods (sound-based playback fails), forcing a new approach. Cost is felt in years of silence and effort. Escalation stems from protagonist agency, though the breakthrough leans slightly on epiphany over struggle, preventing higher escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reconciling scientific ambition with ethical consequence—is signaled early (“blessed pariah”) and deepens via the “glimpse,” which forces Mira to reframe her life’s work. Her agency lies in choosing exploration over control, a renunciation that forecloses temporal manipulation forever. The cost is felt: she accepts permanent exile from her field’s pinnacle, yet finds peace. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the sketching ritual serving as the decisive act that crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—moral restitution for a theft that haunts—is signaled early and tightens when Seraph recognizes the chess pieces as “impossible,” raising emotional risk. Caelius’s agency drives escalation: he spent eleven months devising amends, traded three relics, mapped secrets. The cost is felt (“weight lifted”) and conceptual (he cannot undo harm, only offer truth). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure crystallizes his stance to embrace consequence, not avoid it.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile acts of resistance during societal collapse—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s triage-like archiving. The meaningful tightening occurs when she accepts that some losses (her sister, the pawns) cannot be replaced, shifting from simulation to witness. Agency manifests in attention: choosing which gestures to memorialize, which names to spell, which absences to honor. Cost is unmistakable—the “luminous absence” that fills the space is both emotional void and historical burden, crystallized in the unmoved chessboard.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding home’s shape through buried talent—tightens decisively when the keeper demands a “seed” of honesty, forcing the seer to confront her resistance. The escalation is protagonist-driven: seven nights of tracing deepen her realization that pain stems from dormancy, not destruction, culminating in the eighth night’s whispered question that reweights her entire stance. Cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish the safety of the mountain’s throat to carry her gift outward, accepting that reflections will still substitute reality—but now as doorways. The stone’s requirement (“plant something of yourself”) acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and final action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus court-imposed shame—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to engage the tapestry despite her avoidance patterns. The deepening occurs as each decoded thread reweights her past: what was negligence becomes pedagogical courage. Agency drives escalation; thunder’s return forces urgency, but the cost (enduring decades of misjudgment) is paid in her quiet realization, not external luck. Coincidence (finding the tapestry) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the winnowing is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. enforced forgetting—is signaled early and escalates organically: Sera’s solitary act becomes communal resistance. Her agency drives every turn: arriving early, writing, teaching poems. The cost is felt in lost parts of herself from prior rituals and current peril. Priests’ arrival doesn’t resolve—it reveals the stakes have already shifted beyond their control.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before annihilation—is signaled early and escalates through the rising acid sea and failing seals. The tightening occurs when she chooses memory over survival, matching scars to wounds in a final act of kintsugi. Cost is unmistakable: the workshop’s dissolution, her life’s work lost, yet reconfigured as documentation, not ruin. Agency is clear—she narrates into silence, transforming passive drowning into active witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the meaning of creation—is signaled early and deepens when the shell appears, forcing Marcus to confront his promise. The “wrong turn” complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in his decision to release the painted shell. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits the artifact of his grief, accepting impermanence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights his entire artistic ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—can pure intention guide when technology fails—is signaled early and deepens when thermal currents disrupt the beacon. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to use the vial, not because it’s guaranteed, but because it’s the only path left. The cost is palpable: emotional exposure, the risk of failure, the burden of being unheard. Luck (the garden blooming) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn comes from her deliberate act of sending “vibrations of intent,” narrowing options to a single, fragile frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses to go north, reversing expected migration. This tightening forecloses solitude as a path and incurs emotional cost: she must re-enter another’s grief. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail (static, bronze, moon) intensifying the call’s urgency. Slight deduction: the escalation hinges on one major turn rather than multiple pressure points, limiting complexity within the form’s constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety in a world that criminalizes empathy—is signaled early and intensified through Mira’s embodied truthfulness, which isolates her yet fuels her mission. Pressure escalates texturally: the storm’s fresh wreckage narrows safe passage, border patrol’s dismissal confirms societal blindness, and the orchard’s fragility underscores the precariousness of hope. Her agency is clear—not in grand action but in persistent attention: climbing, harvesting, hiding, studying. The cost is legible in her solitude and the authorities’ fear; the final act of opening the textbooks forecloses assimilation and embraces targeted vulnerability as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the gesture to resolve his abandonment wound—is signaled early and tightens when the folded paper reveals the date matching his mother’s departure. The escalation is driven by Aldric’s agency: his method of “observing gaps” leads him to re-examine the flower, triggering memory recall. Cost is unmistakable: he must confront a lifetime of assumed rejection, now reframed as regret. The “softly persistent” mist and memories create atmospheric pressure, but the real tension is internal—wanting closure vs. fearing another loss.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the “right path home”—is signaled early and deepens when the map proves real. Pressure escalates coherently: ants appear, flowers bloom off-season, creek rises. The tightening occurs when water reaches her ankles, forcing immediate action. Agency is clear: Maren chooses to follow, to descend, to step through. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the escalation leans slightly on environmental coincidence (ants, bloom timing) without full protagonist-driven causation—hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning amid disenchantment—is signaled early and tightens when the grotto reveals the dreams as summons, not omen. The queen’s agency drives escalation: she climbs despite weariness, interprets the fireflies’ response, and kneels to witness. Cost is legible in her three-year emotional drought and the irreversible departure from courtly obligation. The final image crystallizes a stance: wonder regained, but only through solitary confrontation with wounded sky.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing presence without killing it—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s renunciation of distillation. The tightening occurs when she shifts from solitary researcher to communal witness, foreclosing her old methodology. Cost is legible: the pocket-sun cools, light mingles with shadow, yet warmth persists differently. Agency lies in attention, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens perfectly. Only minor deduction: the “hunger” driving Sera remains slightly abstract, diluting secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and deepens as words dissolve and rearrange, forcing the protagonist to accept that control is illusory. The tightening occurs when he realizes lucidity is a curse, not a gift, foreclosing the path of mastery. Agency lies in endurance: choosing to sleep, to soar, to send the scroll despite uncertainty. Cost is felt in the “bitter, corrosive jealousy” and the acceptance that death is already inscribed—a conceptual price that shapes the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after sensory loss—is signaled early and deepened when the birthing screw reveals Mira’s parallel vocation. Pressure escalates texturally: from Elena’s disorientation among “invisible things” to her recognition that both aromatherapy and clock-repair “read between lines.” Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of scent, yet agency emerges through attention; the tightening occurs when she chooses to see rather than mourn. Coincidence never resolves—only patient observation does.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—can Elara inscribe runes that hold meaning?—is signaled early and tightens when rain begins and the platform trembles. Her agency drives escalation: she stops forcing symbols and instead recalls her grandmother’s gestures, a deepening that changes her method and knowledge. The cost is felt in her crystallized tears falling like “shed memories,” and the final trade-off is clear: she surrenders academic control to access ancestral magic. Coincidence never resolves; the storm’s timing pressures but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting before irreversible loss—is signaled early and escalates via the ticking orchard clock and fading currents. The meaningful deepening occurs when Eleanor abandons metaphor for blunt apology, narrowing her emotional options. Cost is felt: the miracle fails before full reconciliation, and the orchard dies. Agency drives escalation (she seeks Margot; she speaks plainly), though external pressure (time, technology) slightly overshadows internal causality in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are declared (“end of history witness,” “resolve contradictions”) but never tested. No tightening occurs: Elara’s journey is meditative, not pressured. The dominant stake—cosmic resolution—remains abstract, with no visible cost, trade-off, or narrowed option. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece accumulates imagery but fails to reweight the central stake through a cadence shift or deepening that alters meaning or consequence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens through Aira’s solitary vigil. The escalation is textural: atmospheric clarity intensifies, water reaches “critical level,” senses sharpen. The cost is conceptual and emotional: she remains alone, committed to an obsolete art, yet finds fulfillment. No external antagonist, but the pressure of legacy and cosmic alignment coheres under the Accumulative lens. Agency lies in endurance and attention, which foreclose modernity’s ease.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether connection requires disclosure—is signaled early and deepens when the man speaks, forcing Mira to confront the cost of her chosen separation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to maintain distance for three years culminates in the quiet wildfire of acknowledged intimacy. The price is felt in the irreversible shift—once spoken, their silence cannot return. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens, with the fungal light’s brightening as organic intensifier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love for risk with the grief of loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from decoding scrawls to interpreting them as invitations. The meaningful tightening occurs when she boards the train despite dry, unmarked seats, choosing hope over evidence. Cost is felt in her renunciation of control: “the house does not play” reframes her father’s gambling not as failure but as yearning. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (scrawls appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to strangers’ endings—tightens when the harmonica sings and the first call dials, forcing Mira’s reaffirmation of her role. Agency lies in attention: she chooses to listen, never correct, and thus enables catharsis without intrusion. The cost is visible in what she forfeits: connection, gratitude, identity. Escalation is driven by atmospheric pressure shifts (ventilation, streetlamps), not coincidence, deepening the textural weight of her solitude under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments without being crushed by their weight—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification: the archivist’s shift from fearing proximity to the photo to trusting its layered truth. This deepening is driven by her agency (choosing to examine, to breathe, to promise anew) under the Accumulative lens, and it forecloses the path of archival detachment. Cost is unmistakable: she must accept that her grandmother would barely recognize her, yet finds richness in that very distance. Pressure coheres without reliance on coincidence or external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocal recognition—is signaled early and deepens via the trade rule. Escalation occurs through the logistician’s own agency: they articulate their need, accept the terms, and commit to staying. The tightening forecloses their habitual escape path (“always left before anyone could thank them”), with visible emotional cost. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (rumor chain) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara interprets the ring’s tremor, reads bark, follows tonal breadcrumbs. The meaningful tightening occurs when time distorts (“hours passed, or perhaps minutes”), forcing reliance on inner calibration over external markers. Cost is unmistakable: she trades the quest for an external stillpoint for the harder work of becoming still herself. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her sensory interpretation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discerning true cosmic communication from noise—is signaled early and deepened when Mira chooses contingent relationships over protocol. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from analyzing the signal alone to listening to its “relationships with others,” narrowing her approach under pressure. Cost is felt in her exile and professional shame, but the escalation hinges more on insight than active trade-offs; the gravitational anomaly complicates but doesn’t force a binary choice. Still, agency drives the resolution: her method yields the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating unrecordable grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elena appears, forcing Marina to improvise beyond folk tales. The tightening occurs in Marina’s spontaneous signing, which narrows her options: she must risk exposing raw, untaught shapes of loss. Cost is unmistakable—Elena’s shaking shoulders and Marina’s own “joyful sorrow” prove stakes are viscerally felt, not abstract. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against systems that hoard knowledge—is signaled immediately and deepens when Mira discovers the lineage of guardianship. The tightening occurs at the portrait: her choice to trace scratches rather than flee or destroy redefines her mission. Cost is felt in lost time, severed identity, and the burden of legacy. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency, though the transition from fugitive to scholar compresses seventeen months too quickly, slightly blurring tactical evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving Mira’s dream through entangled consciousness—is signaled early and tightens at the hush of the universe inhaling. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her secret drumming deepens the link, narrowing options (she can’t unsee the lagoon’s breath). Cost is felt in bodily sacrifice and emotional isolation, culminating in a stance that forecloses scientific compliance. Coincidence never resolves; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outperform institutional tech—is signaled early and tightens when GPS fails, forcing Mira to rely on her network. Her agency drives escalation: she initiates the whisper chain, identifies Dmitri by gait, and guides 200 workers through trust architecture. Cost is unmistakable: time, physical risk, and social capital spent countering Reyes’ skepticism, culminating in his humbled admission. The storm complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from Mira’s pre-existing relational infrastructure, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether despair can be met with witnessed hope—is signaled early and deepens when the boy arrives carrying “the mathematics of pain.” The guardian’s agency drives escalation: her deliberate weaving of light forces a shift from passive suffering to active witnessing. Cost is unmistakable: she endures nineteen years of silence and channels her survival into fragile, ephemeral gestures. The boy’s lifted head marks a narrowing of options—he either receives this offering or remains lost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—planting second thoughts through amplified quiet—is signaled early and deepens via the window displays’ ripple effects. Pressure tightens when individual townspeople act on their doubts, narrowing the path of unquestioned certainty. Agency is expressed through renunciation (Eleanor never speaks directly) and attention (orchestrating silence). Cost is felt but not dramatized as loss; it’s opportunity foregone (e.g., decades of unspoken words), which slightly softens the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—emotional liberation from self-imposed armor—is signaled early (“world’s certainties blurred”) and deepens when the whale’s call reframes violence-as-impossible into surrender-as-freedom. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she *chooses* to unclasp the scrimshaw, *chooses* to step off the dock. The cost—abandoning her father’s heirloom and curated identity—is visible and irreversible. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through cadence shifts (from coiled restraint to fluid release) and the whale’s song narrowing options until only one path remains: into the liminal sea.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic grief under enforced happiness—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s method of dramatic narration, which forecloses genuine expression but enables survival. Escalation is driven by agency: choosing whittling over compliance, using voice as camouflage. Cost is unmistakable: maternal death, emotional void, isolation. The final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—accessing the sacred through dissolved perception—is signaled early and deepens as the poet moves from threshold to heart. The tightening occurs at the third column, where she realizes boundaries are mental, not physical, altering her tactics from cautious approach to active recitation. The cost is subtle but present: the relinquishment of old prohibitions, felt in the “settled knowledge” that replaces tremor. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the absence of tangible risk slightly softens the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding and transmitting beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from painting to composing plant-glass arrangements, raising the stakes from observation to communication. The meaningful tightening occurs when she offers the reed tongue, transforming private vision into shared language. Cost is felt in her vulnerability and the apprentice’s dawning responsibility. Though pressure remains coherent, the escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing, slightly limiting agency-driven intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether artificial experience can carry genuine spiritual weight—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s methodological choices. Escalation occurs via her agency: by rejecting factory lenses for the scratched carbide glass, she stakes her credibility on imperfection-as-truth. The tightening comes when she realizes the destination matters less than the “repeatedly interrupted” journey—a trade-off that forecloses easy solutions. Cost is legible in her solitude and the committee’s skepticism, culminating in the high-risk trial run where failure means confirming the world’s spiritual barrenness.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether grief permits blooming again—is signaled early and tightened when Elara offers the pendant containing “entirely real” grief within a “genuinely artificial” vessel. This act forecloses denial and forces the newcomer to confront paradox. Pressure escalates through the observatory’s sentient guidance (origami coordinates), culminating in Elara’s invitation to meet her future self—a trade-off between isolation and communal mourning. The cost is felt in the woman’s vertigo and Elara’s perpetual, unrepaired heart.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping meaning in systemic collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Soren confesses his role. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maren hands him the tape: a physical act that shifts agency from analysis to embodied intuition. Cost is felt in Soren’s voice breaking and his shoulders finally easing—visible emotional labor. While escalation is subtle, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens: each card adds layer, each raindrop multiplies paths, until the weight of shared understanding becomes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—purifying nostalgia without trapping it—is signaled early and deepens as the protagonist realizes her role is not possession but passage. The tightening occurs when she abandons control: “purification required not capture but release.” This renunciation forecloses her original scholarly goal, replacing it with sacrificial transmission. The cost is felt in “anguished joy” and the irreversible merging of self with history. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental aids.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s evolving shape—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s comparison of archival footage, narrowing her focus to the mother-child dissolution frame. Escalation occurs via accumulation: old vs. new hope, bound vs. unbound shadows. Cost is conceptual (eroded personal memory) and emotional (bearing witness to wet grief), legible when she admits some gaps “are better left preserved.” Yet agency remains passive; pressure tightens perception, not choice, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling shattered trust with ongoing care—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s reconstruction work, which narrows her path from disillusionment to active mending. Pressure tightens via the tail’s symbolism and tomorrow’s confrontation, forcing a trade-off between despair and responsibility. Cost is felt in the “fragile weight of restoration” and her acknowledgment of permanent incompleteness. Escalation is protagonist-driven but slightly abstract in the middle beat (“shedding layers of disillusionment” borders on summary).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with her brother’s death—is signaled early and tightens through Maya’s descent into the basement, where each choice (touching the hourglass, kneeling at the mug) narrows her path toward truth. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses the dawn, turns the hourglass, crawls into the tunnel. Cost is felt in the scars she finally reinterprets as love, not shame, and in the seventeen years lost—a price paid before the final beat but made visible only at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to unearth or honor unfinished goodbyes—is signaled early and deepens when Mira sees the sisters’ suspended letters as “doorways.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes the film’s purpose: to incubate unsent farewells. Her agency drives escalation—she chooses trust, then witness, then withdrawal—with cost in emotional labor and relinquished possession. Though pressure is internal and textural, it coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where options (take or leave) are crystallized but only one path honors the love’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Seraphine realizes her desperation repels inspiration. The deepening occurs when she chooses rest over grasping, narrowing her options from active pursuit to receptive stillness. Agency is internal but potent: her shift in attention constitutes a renunciation that forecloses frantic effort. Cost is felt (physical exhaustion, wasted time), though the escalation relies more on introspection than external pressure, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the clock/archive as vessels of suspended hope—is signaled early and deepens when the merchant offers transactional temptation. The meaningful tightening occurs in Mira’s refusal, which forecloses negotiation and affirms her role as cultivator, not seller. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she bears the weight of all that might have been, with no relief. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her stance, not luck), though the pressure remains atmospheric rather than physical, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting the “wild frontier of his mind”—tightens decisively when Cyrus kneels before the tangle, choosing vulnerability over evasion. This deepening is driven by his agency: placing the gear initiates unraveling, proving insight requires participation, not observation. Cost is unmistakable: stability is forfeited permanently (“no back to return to”), and the jungle’s farewell hum underscores irreversible transformation. Escalation follows Accumulative/Textural rules—density of resonant images (gears, songs, metals) reweights the stake without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early and tightens when the leash slips away, foreclosing return. The indirect route forces confrontation with memory and intention, raising emotional cost. Agency is clear: she rises, accepts the token, chooses the middle path. However, the ferry guides’ passive role means escalation stems from internal pressure alone, slightly softening the external friction expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and deepened when Marcus chooses to follow the bronze trail instead of reporting it. This tightening forecloses the path of passive compliance and forces a trade-off: risk vs. truth. The cost is legible in his humming nerves (“pain or hope”) and the irreversible act of continuing upward. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not grand action, yet the price is unmistakable: he re-enters the world of danger and music he once fled.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—unmasking a lineage fraud—is signaled early and deepens through Threnody’s accumulation of cryptic evidence across centuries. Escalation occurs via the cosmic shift (“first constellation paused”), which tightens the timeline and introduces the heir’s birth as a live variable. Agency is clear: her sunder is linguistic, not violent, and forecloses theatrical exposure in favor of textual inevitability. The cost—endless solitude—is felt but not dramatized in action; still, the closure reweights it as necessary sacrifice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping vanishing ecological corridors—is signaled early and deepened when new coral defies expectations. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she alters buoy protocols via invented taps, narrowing options from measurement to dialogue. Cost is felt in the abandonment of old rhythms and inherited cartographic certainty. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through data density and pattern rupture, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming rebellion’s meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the stone circle’s hum shifts from memory to “chord of possibility,” forcing Kira’s choice. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her patience unlocks the circle’s new frequency. Cost is felt in the burden of leadership (“carry the circle’s hum to the others”) and abandonment of waiting. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to honor or evolve tradition—is signaled early and deepens when the plants “scream.” Yara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to interpret the script, defying elders. Cost is legible: breaking generational silence risks her safety. The tightening is subtle but sufficient—one meaningful deepening where knowledge (embryo as key) forces renunciation of concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—building a survivable present amid irreversible loss—is signaled early and deepened through her refusal to “heal” conventionally. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each morning’s ritual narrows her world to manageable somatic markers until the cereus bloom becomes possible. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits closure (keeps photo crumpled), light (lighthouse stays dark), and narrative recovery. Coincidence never resolves; resilience is earned through repetitive, physical acts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming artistic integrity through acceptance of fragmentation—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the cards “were waiting to be seen differently.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to untangle threads rather than force coherence, narrowing her options to trust intuition over control. Cost is felt: she must descend into “necessary darkness,” relinquishing the safety of fixed forms. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure intensifies more texturally than causally.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and tightens when the tracker realizes Vasquez studied the same phenomenon. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he reads the ink, summons the drone, touches the stain. Cost is legible: his body fades, consciousness expands into “the space between moments.” Yet the “consciously wild intelligence” introduces external pressure too late to fully integrate, slightly weakening the coherence of opposition under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus preservation—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Kira realizes the war was manufactured, forcing a trade-off between duty and conscience. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her reading triggers internal crisis, her reflection weighs protocols, and her decision initiates transmission. Cost is unmistakable: she risks professional ruin and societal upheaval. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via textual density and cadence shift (“words swam… each sentence a small apocalypse”), culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses archival neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—maintaining continuity through chaos—is signaled early and intensified when refugees arrive, forcing Mira to act on her ethos. The tightening occurs not through external threat but internal crystallization: choosing nurture over suspicion, a renunciation that forecloses her father’s path with palpable cost (isolation, vulnerability). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with pressure accumulating through sensory and moral density rather than plot turns. Cost is legible in the “tranquil blaze” that defies the gunfire beyond.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo without scattering it—is signaled early and escalates via Morwen’s agency: his silence slows waves, his movement creates resonance, his voiced silence completes the refrain. Cost is unmistakable: others fail by shouting; Morwen succeeds by sacrificing noise, bearing eternal solitude. The tightening choice—voicing silence—narrows options (no tools, no boat, only spike and stillness). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cycle of journalistic suppression—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanor applies proof by contradiction, foreclosing denial. The deepening reveals sabotage within her organization, raising stakes from personal guilt to institutional betrayal. Agency is clear: her reforms (hiring investigators, expanding beats) contradict the accusation, and her decision to seek evidence first is a high-stakes gamble. Cost is felt in the “orbits of regret” she refuses to join, with social and moral price implied in confronting her own empire.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resolving the dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the firmware reveals coordinates, narrowing options to one decisive action. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Mira chooses to press the amber, to follow the signal, to work in the chamber. The cost is felt (emotional, temporal, existential) but remains largely conceptual; a more tangible forfeiture (e.g., sacrificing her tattoos, aging, or severing a relationship) would elevate it. Coincidence is avoided; everything stems from prior cause.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether art can be truthful without permanence—is signaled early and deepens when Elara interjects the tile, narrowing options: she must accept impermanence or remain paralyzed. The tightening is driven by her agency (kneeling, drawing, inserting), not coincidence. Cost is felt in abandoned paintings and the “repelled” certainty that proper art felt like lying. Final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure from setting and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against collective amnesia—is signaled early and deepens when Lysara recognizes Soren’s shared affliction, transforming her mission from solitary obsession to intergenerational transmission. The tightening occurs in her realization: “She could not save the dead… But she could rename what remained.” This renunciation forecloses passive mourning and demands active creation, with cost in emotional labor and social isolation (“foolish” vs. “forgetful”). Agency is clear: her choice to press the tessera into Soren’s hands is irreversible, altering his identity and the city’s future. No coincidence resolves tension; the fire’s aftermath is the crucible, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping despair through performance—is signaled early via Elara’s “suicide of hope” and Mira’s ruined audition. Pressure escalates when Elara produces echoes, forcing Mira to confront fractured timelines; this deepening reweights failure as generative. Agency lies in Mira’s touch, which crystallizes stance without external rescue. Cost is felt: Elara’s 47-year burden lifts only when she enables another’s choice—her encore is quiet witness, not applause.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—authentic human connection versus invasive technological simulation—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the pills “dissolved boundaries they never chose to dissolve.” The tightening occurs when the geode offers “invitation rather than intrusion,” forcing Mira to choose a path of voluntary vulnerability. Agency is clear: she presses the sliver to her temple, interprets somatic markers, and resolves to “devise a gentler approach.” Cost is conceptual but palpable: relinquishing the promise of guaranteed understanding for a fragile, uncertain method.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—articulating the world’s silent transformations—is signaled early and deepens when the elm leaf reveals “factually mystical” heat signatures. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maren floats into the tidal pool, committing fully to sensory immersion; this act forecloses detachment and demands vocalization. Cost is conceptual: she inherits the burden of witnessing what others cannot perceive. Though pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the escalation leans slightly more on revelation than active choice—agency is present but subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering fragmented wisdom through humble artifacts—is signaled early and deepens when the canyon echo reveals prophecy as unspun thread. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara shifts from cataloging to unscrambling, transforming passive archiving into active synthesis. Cost is felt: years of solitude, dismissal by peers, and the burden of holding unfinished stories. Though no external antagonist pressures her, the internal pressure of responsibility and the High Seers’ eventual validation confirm the stakes were real and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—delivering proof to expose systemic rot—is signaled early and deepens when Elena chooses exposure over hiding, betting enemies expect cowardice. This “prudently daring” move narrows options: she risks capture for a chance at redemption. Cost is felt in her scars and solitude, and the snow-code reading forces a real-time tactical shift. While the ally’s arrival introduces external help, the escalation remains driven by Elena’s prior choice to climb, satisfying agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—carrying forward what deserves preservation—is signaled early and deepens via the needle’s evolving meaning. The tightening occurs in reflection: the promise shifts from geographic duty to existential continuity, foreclosing simpler interpretations. Though pressure remains internal and atmospheric rather than external, the Accumulative lens validates this escalation. Cost is conceptual (the burden of distillation) and legible in the final poise, though not visceral or material.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why gentleness can resist annihilation—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes kindness is a “frequency” that persists across timelines. The tightening occurs when the lantern’s thrum shifts pitch in response to her touch, forcing her to choose tenderness over extraction. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she must now bear the weight of transmitting this fragile knowledge, foreclosing a life of mere pottery-making. Agency is quiet but decisive—her stillness becomes the act.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether hope can be instilled in grief—is signaled early and deepened when the child arrives. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, share the talisman, reinterpret loss through craft, and plant anew. Cost is unmistakable: the dead dog, the father’s death, the bush’s repeated die-backs. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and symbolic density, not causality, culminating in a stance that forecloses despair without denying pain.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to extinction while resisting despair—is signaled early and deepens when the reincarnation memory surfaces. The tightening occurs at the sundial: Elara shifts from passive mourner to active receiver of ancestral legacy. Agency is exercised through attention and movement (“waded toward the eastern stacks”), and the cost—three centuries of solitude—is made legible in the hum that “softened, as if listening.” Escalation is driven by protagonist insight, not coincidence, though physical action remains minimal, slightly limiting tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether human longing can be bridged through mediated speech—is signaled early and deepens when the nest reveals Mira’s own unspoken thread. The tightening occurs internally: her decision to build the installation forecloses continued anonymity, trading private utility for public vulnerability. Though coincidence (the storm-dislodged nest) complicates, it doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her interpretation and action. Cost is felt: transforming secrets into art risks exposure, yet the story earns this escalation through Mira’s accumulated emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—disrupting artificial discord—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes the tricksters exploit natural tensions. Her agency drives escalation: she calculates counter-frequencies, risking equipment failure. The deepening occurs when she grasps the method’s ancient, predatory nature, raising the conceptual stakes. Cost is legible in her sleepless night and the irreversible burden of eternal watchfulness. No coincidence resolves the conflict; victory is partial, earned, and fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the key to continue her grandfather’s rebellion against forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when the organ’s music paralyzes her, forcing a choice between surrender and defiance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she breaks paralysis through memory and will. Cost is felt (emotional toll, inherited burden), though the spatial mutiny’s rules slightly soften external pressure. Coincidence (organ playing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she earns the key through persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making the invisible visible—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes she must paint “from the negative space of her killer’s soul.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she unifies opposites: Marguerite’s terror vs. killer’s triumph. Agency is clear: her choice to paint emotion over evidence forecloses forensic resolution but enables emotional closure. Cost is felt: families carry “stones in their chests”; Elena trades answers for peace. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring her great-grandmother’s scientific legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Maren realizes the truth is guarded, not lost. The deepening comes through the journals’ coded stanzas, which narrow her options: publish and risk career, or stay silent and perpetuate exile. The cost is unmistakable—intergenerational injustice, unmitigated climate disaster—and the escalation is driven by Maren’s agency (decoding, confronting researchers, choosing action). The “reversible exile” concept elevates stakes beyond personal grievance to systemic accountability, though the institutional opposition remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to ephemeral truths—is signaled early and tightened when the hitchhiker vanishes, forcing the fiddler to choose between rational dismissal and receptive faith. The deepening occurs at the glass flake’s revelation, which narrows her options: she must either reject the vision or integrate it into her life’s work. She chooses the latter, paying the cost of permanent uncertainty (“luminous disbelief”) but gaining purpose. Coincidence (finding the flake) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her decision to believe and retell.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving creative territory against corporate absorption—is signaled early and tightened through Elena’s acquisition offer. The meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus reframes “clean start” as “erasure,” forcing a trade-off between financial security and identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat adds density to the territorial metaphor until the final crystallization. Cost is felt in the implied forfeiture of stability, though not yet paid—sufficient for Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding temple inscriptions via dreams—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the inscriptions are astronomical records. The meaningful deepening occurs when she connects dream patterns to Cepheid light curves, foreclosing solitary interpretation. Cost is felt: she must abandon decades of isolated scholarship to “share the burden.” Agency drives escalation—her choice to spread journals across the desk crystallizes the turn. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from prior groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redemption through unmaking—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen realizes “finding was not the same as fixing,” forcing a trade-off: destroy his frozen error to save the orchard, sacrificing his reputation. Agency drives escalation: his counter-rotation *causes* the vortex to speed, which *causes* the ice to crack. The cost is unmistakable: “The other druids would know of his failure,” yet he accepts it. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under coherent magical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answering the covenant’s call—is signaled early via the clipping’s ritualistic gift. Pressure escalates texturally: static-charged air, elongated shadows, humming ribcage culminate in the eclipse of possibility. Her agency is decision-as-endurance: choosing to plant the clipping despite terror. Cost is felt in bodily terms (“sharp edges bite into the old scar”) and existential ones (surrendering autonomy to become a bridge). Coincidence never resolves; the future arrives early, but her readiness is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—patching soul-holes by retrieving her sister—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively at the golden tree: the price is not reversal but transference, narrowing options to irreversible sacrifice. Agency is clear: Elara initiates and completes the barter. Cost is unmistakable on the page: “hollow spaces where memories should have been,” “burned-out spaces where joy used to live.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each image deepens the moral calculus until the final trade-off crystallizes with emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether purpose can survive after loss—is signaled early and deepens through Marcus’s confrontation with the television failure and the amplifier’s ghostly offer. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his choice to engage with the collector’s message, wrestle with his phone, and ultimately decide to drive. Cost is unmistakable: re-entering the geography of trauma (Elko, site of the singer’s death) risks re-amplifying grief. Pressure tightens not through external force but through the unbearable weight of silence versus sound.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the seed must be “planted in understanding.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the seed’s opening: her ambition shifts from external validation to internal transmission, foreclosing the path of fame. Cost is visible in her tears and the relinquishment of centuries-long echo. Agency drives escalation: her analogical thinking (linking cuneiform evolution to arboreal suspension) unlocks the seed’s function, making pressure protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are singular and escalating: the fragile existence of migrating identities depends on Asa’s acceptance of their contradictions. Pressure tightens through lunar cycles—identities grow “bright and articulate” then retreat—and climaxes in smelting, where pain is transformed into book covers. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: identities must surrender continuity to be preserved, and Asa pays perpetual emotional labor. Though no external antagonist exists, the situational pressure of time (“after tomorrow disappears”) and entropy (“contradictions that each identity carried”) forces Asa’s renunciation of change for herself, crystallizing her stance with quiet gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—what humans need to survive—tightens when Margret realizes rations and bunks are irrelevant next to unsaid words. Her agency drives escalation: reading a shell, recognizing the pearl’s hunger for confessions, then choosing to carry both upward. Cost is felt: she’ll file the official report (complicity in sealing truth) but subvert it by sending shells outward—a moral trade-off with social risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through her encounter with graffiti, which forces a reconfiguration of identity. The tightening occurs when she shifts from documenting rivers to mapping the station’s emotional cartography, foreclosing her old narrative of blame. Cost is unmistakable: she carries shame like physical weight, and her refusal to play the accordion marks a live loss. Escalation is driven by her agency—she chooses to enter, read, hold, write—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens through the watch’s reversal and self-writing books, which narrow options by revealing future documentation as part of the present search. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she follows the watch, documents phenomena, and places her hand on the door. Cost is felt conceptually—the watch falls silent, its purpose exhausted—and emotionally, as she confronts the weight of all unsaid truths. The “cyclically reversed” nature isn’t just thematic; it forces her to act amid confusion, trusting propagation delays as part of the cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—choosing between empire of knowledge and dream of music—is signaled early and tightened by the coffee-stain vision that shows both paths fading. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she reads the grounds, listens to the wisteria, interprets perforations. Cost is unmistakable: whichever path she neglects will vanish like the countess into impossibility. Coincidence (the violin’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through her decisive gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as the spark “threatened to fade.” Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: her infusion deepens pressure, narrowing options to a single decisive act. Cost is felt (“holy work,” “weight of responsibility”) but remains conceptual rather than visceral; a minor deduction for lack of tangible forfeiture beyond emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when peace proves insufficient. The tightening occurs in Elara’s repeated climbs, narrowing her focus from judgment to spirit. Agency is internal but potent: her realization reframes her entire role. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—she relinquishes the hope of arrival, accepting perpetual care. No external antagonist, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—maintaining “protected vulnerability” as professional and existential necessity—is signaled early and deepened through Mara’s reflection on Thomas’s session and her own mirror test. The meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes her own “certain” compass amid facilitating others’ uncertainty, foreclosing emotional withdrawal. Cost is felt in the “carefully maintained wound” that “never quite closed over.” Agency lies in endurance and readiness, not action, fitting the Situational/Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning vanishing—is signaled early and tightens through each ripple, culminating in Mina’s realization that teaching *is* vanishing. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her patience allows the rings to reach her, and her final act reconfigures the stake. Cost is unmistakable: decades of solitude ahead, mirrored in her future self on the shore. The researcher’s withholding isn’t coincidence but coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization—precisely what the Situational/Accumulative lens demands.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating without moving—is signaled early and deepened through the birds’ patterns and pulse expansion. The tightening occurs when the arrowhead warms at apex awareness, narrowing options to pure perception. Cost is felt: her body petrifies while her spirit roams, a trade-off made visible in “limbs taking on the texture… of the bone towers.” Agency lies in sustained attention, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recognition of sacred simplicity—is signaled early (“forgotten things are beautiful”) and deepens when the keystone disrupts automation. Agency lies in Mira’s quiet refusal to report the error, then her acceptance of the mist. Escalation is driven by her choice to touch the stone, which collapses the ward system. Cost is felt: she leaves behind her entire life, but the story avoids explicit loss because the Accumulative lens renders cost through absence (shed skin, dissolved algorithms).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s failed efforts versus his eventual receptivity. The meaningful tightening occurs when he abandons active searching (“did not respond to demand”) and surrenders to stillness. Cost is felt in years of strain and cold water, paid before the climax. Agency lies in endurance and attention, not action, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discerning meaning in cosmic noise—is signaled early and deepens when static grows denser post-contraction. Kira’s agency lies in attention and distillation, not force; her choice to witness (not predict) forecloses control with felt cost: she accepts ambiguity as the price of true understanding. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven ritual (casting coins) that narrows options from interpretation to recognition. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the burst aligns because she’s listening. Cost is legible in her renunciation of foresight—a quiet but irreversible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming fears to survive eternity—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: listening to recordings forces confrontation, leading to active naming. The deepening occurs when she realizes Elias’s words were instruction, not poetry—a knowledge shift that reweights her entire vocation. Cost is unmistakable: carrying named grief “into the night” replaces numb efficiency with vulnerable purpose. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each named monster narrowing the path back to emotional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring the village’s connection to the sea—is signaled early and tightens when the mage realizes extreme magic would shatter the bell. His agency lies in renouncing force for persistence, a trade-off that costs stamina and self-doubt. The escalation is Accumulative: pressure intensifies through rhythmic droplets and narrowing crack, not external opposition. Cost is visible in aching arms and “thin” magic, but the story avoids false stakes or coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased history against institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens as the reservoir recedes. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to leave photographs, to interpret the town’s “language,” to sit and prepare meaning for others. The tightening occurs when she finds the intact bottles beneath the tavern—a live option (salvage) emerges, yet she knows it may be reburied. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: truth persists only if someone bears witness, and she accepts that burden alone in the hush before other wardens arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses reverence over detachment watching starlings, foreclosing her old methodology. Cost is felt in her tears and shattered “mask,” though the escalation leans slightly more on accumulation than protagonist-driven agency under pressure. The deepening occurs via observation (starling patterns as map), which, while passive, aligns with the Accumulative lens. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; revelation emerges from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through precise observation—is signaled early and deepens when the cold front shifts, forcing a high-stakes revision. Agency lies in the protagonist’s decision to recalculate and transmit new coordinates, narrowing Elena’s survival path. Cost is unmistakable: physical tension (“knuckles white”), emotional isolation (“could not share the danger”), and the burden of knowledge that cannot be acted upon directly. Pressure escalates coherently under the Situational lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens via the clone’s presence, which transforms abstract yearning into interpersonal pressure. The tightening occurs when the narrator realizes violence won’t restore feeling, forcing a shift from domination to connection. Cost is unmistakable: the original must relinquish primacy, accepting they are now one half of a bifurcated consciousness. Agency drives escalation—the decision to vivify, not strike—under Accumulative pressure of shared memory and divergent experience.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving space for radical creativity against commercial predictability—is signaled early and deepens when the seed reframes Mira’s approach. The meaningful tightening occurs when she stops building toward “predictable climaxes” and embraces “possibility spaces,” foreclosing investor satisfaction for artistic integrity. Agency is internal but potent: her attention becomes resistance. Cost is felt in lost market appeal, though not dramatized through external confrontation. Coincidence (anonymous seed) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mira’s response earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter through acoustic tending—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s acceptance of delayed results. Escalation occurs through intensifying sound layers (sputter → rumble → chorus) and the conceptual shift from force to invitation. The cost is felt: his labor may never be witnessed or rewarded, yet he continues. Under an Accumulative lens, this single, sustained pressure point suffices, though a second tactical adjustment would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—relieving dimensional homesickness—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant arrives. The tightening occurs when she interiorizes exteriors, transforming longing into welcome; this agency-driven shift narrows her options from passive waiting to active movement. Cost is felt in the marrow-deep grief now softened but not erased. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interrupting “stifling destiny”—tightens decisively when Mara realizes the crozier must be catalyst, not fuel, forcing renunciation of preservation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: eleven years of “successive approximation” culminate in the snap that destroys her relic. Cost is unmistakable: the crozier burns “to nothing,” returning borrowed energy, and Mara walks away empty-handed. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each failure deepens the thematic weight until release becomes the only viable tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interpreting the unnameable signal—is signaled early and tightens when the “geometric silence” defies measurement, forcing Mara to abandon tools for direct attunement. This deepening is driven by her agency (discarding assumptions) and carries cost: she relinquishes empirical control for intuitive vulnerability. The lunar perigee acts as a live clock, narrowing the window for reception, and the final realization forecloses her old interpretive framework. One meaningful intensification suffices, and it’s masterfully executed under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—maintaining fragile transit between fractured realities—is signaled early and deepens when the radio warns of forced merger. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she interprets patterns, chooses to intervene, and endures scattering across timelines. Cost is legible in her permanent transience, though the story slightly softens consequence by making realignment “gentle.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mastery over rational enchantment versus surrender to its autonomy—is signaled early and deepens when the gallery “asserts its own agency.” The eruption isn’t coincidence; it’s the logical consequence of weaving sinew into perception’s architecture. Cost is unmistakable: her memories are overwritten, and she accepts permanent uncertainty. Agency drives escalation—she *chooses* to continue weaving during the hum, knowing the price. One meaningful deepening suffices, and here it’s resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating humanity’s place in a newly vast cosmos—is signaled early via Mira’s starlight question. Pressure tightens when Dr. Chen reveals the aliens’ imminent departure, transforming calculation from academic exercise to urgent inheritance. The deepening forces Mira to crystallize her stance: using ancestral grounding to embrace cosmic expansion. Cost is conceptual (humanity’s sudden solitude) and visible in her solitary walk home, though the aliens’ offstage departure slightly softens agency.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and deepens when the hearing aid reveals Margot’s plea. Pressure escalates causally: static → heartbeat → whisper → imperative (“Come find me”), each layer narrowing Elena’s options from analysis to action. The cost is tangible: she abandons protocol, equipment, and emotional detachment. Coincidence never resolves; agency drives escalation—Elena’s frequency adjustments unearth the message, and her run into the mist crystallizes commitment. The stake tightens from tracing to safeguarding, with moral weight in “protect vulnerable voices—even those that had already fallen silent.”

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—retrieving Elara’s truth versus escaping claustrophobic dread—tightens decisively when Maren touches the codex and perceives the voices. This deepening isn’t coincidental; it’s triggered by her agency (approaching, touching) and reframes the mission from recovery to communion. The six-hour tidal limit applies consistent pressure, and the final renunciation (staying) carries irreversible cost: loss of bodily autonomy and return to surface life. One minor flaw: the cables’ sentience arrives without intermediate clues, slightly softening the escalation’s causality.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—being seen as alive despite systemic erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s ritual. The tightening occurs when she chooses empathy over vengeance, foreclosing perpetual anger at visible cost: she must carry the architect’s regret forward. Agency drives escalation: each ink stroke reorganizes consciousness, culminating in a stance crystallization that reweights what survival means. Coincidence never resolves; wisdom is wrested from failure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning beyond linguistic death—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s descent into the canyon. Escalation is driven by her agency: pressing the diamond, moving down the path, opening her mouth to speak. The cost is felt: the curse’s weight, the irreversible vanishing of the elders’ words. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density, not plot turns, and the final helix of birds reweights everything with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—pursuing truth beyond institutional blindness—is signaled early and deepens when Amari’s metamorphosis reframes bitterness as cosmic humor. Pressure escalates texturally: static sharpens into voice, gravity intensifies, the creature manifests. Mira’s agency lies in her refusal to retreat; her final step is a renunciation of academic safety with felt cost. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—Amari’s return is the inciting pressure, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reawakening dormant beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the statues turn, forcing Elara to choose between uprooting or reawakening. Her agency crystallizes in playing, which narrows options: she commits to resonance over silence. Cost is felt in the orchard’s response (statues exhale remembrance, fruit sheds tarnish)—a visible reconfiguration earned by her action. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each sensory beat intensifies until music breaks fossilized silence.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—keeping human connections alive across enforced borders—is signaled early and deepens when Aram’s medicine delivery raises personal risk. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to break rules, not because he can, but because he must. The cost is felt (potential arrest, moral burden) and crystallizes in his final walk. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens through character decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the wind bells’ chime compels movement. The tightening occurs at the threshold of the impossible door: a live option (routine tea) foreclosed by wonder. Agency drives escalation: his choice to enter, observe without touching, then sing, alters the fragment’s state. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from maker of frozen horses to bearer of luminous repair.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening analog memory—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam recognizes the scarf’s significance. Escalation occurs through her ritual, a choice that narrows options (she commits to belief in physical narrative) and incurs emotional cost (decades of solitude). The tightening is subtle but sufficient: from passive observation to active invocation. Luck (the woman’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Miriam’s action earns the reawakening. A stronger visible forfeiture (e.g., sacrificing another object) would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing runaway dreams—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the child’s photo is “incomplete.” Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to experiment, then to pursue her own dream. The cost is legible in the final image: the dream settles, but Mira remains in the library, her work continuing—longing transformed, not erased. Coincidence (finding the 1832 journal) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her skill and persistence earn the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s endurance. The tightening occurs when she nearly convinces herself she’s “mad,” raising emotional stakes; the final act isn’t physical but perceptual: recognizing the hair as a key, not a talisman. Agency is renunciation: she doesn’t publish or preach, but lets the idea go. Cost is visible—seventeen years of anonymity, doubt, and isolation—paid long before dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes only the ring can detect them. His agency drives escalation: swimming into the greenhouse, pressing his palm to the mushroom, enduring grief to retrieve his grandmother’s face. Cost is unmistakable: decades of labor, emotional exposure, and the irreversible loss of empirical certainty. The deepening occurs when he accepts that some truths exist beyond measurement—a trade-off that reconfigures his entire epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile as spiritual relocation—is signaled early and deepened through Maren’s mentorship tactics. The meaningful tightening occurs when she steps back, creating space that shifts power dynamics. Agency is expressed through renunciation (not comforting) and endurance (waiting), with visible cost in her isolation. However, the children’s external conflict remains vague, slightly weakening the escalation’s causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens through the heirloom seed’s arrival from a colorless realm. Pressure tightens via the seed’s fragility and the orchard’s liminal fatigue, forcing Elara’s precise, sacrificial act. Escalation is driven by her agency (pruning deadwood, preparing soil), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the “hush of budding hope”—a fragile, precarious renewal—but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., lost memory, severed connection) that would elevate to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing a spirit trapped by failing ritual bindings—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the net is a mask. Pressure escalates through tactile struggle (each knot’s sigh) and emotional weight (the spirit’s exhaustion). The tightening occurs at dawn: three knots remain, and the cost becomes personal (her father’s ghost). Agency is total—Mira’s needle drives every turn, and the resolution forecloses her old understanding of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence without violating it—is signaled early and deepens when the 1987 footage reveals human intervention. Pressure escalates via Elena’s methodical verification, culminating in the choice to withdraw rather than intrude, which narrows options with clear cost: deferred knowledge. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension. However, the escalation lacks a single decisive physical or tactical shift beyond observation—the tightening is intellectual/emotional, which fits the lens but slightly softens the pressure’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding how to let go—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam finds Eleanor’s note, which reframes death as transformation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to untangle the seaweed and read the message, narrowing her path from passive observer to active messenger. Cost is felt: delivering the note means confronting her own inability to release the ocean. Agency is clear, though the escalation leans more on revelation than physical action, slightly softening pressure under strict causal standards.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs across death’s boundary—is signaled early and tightens during the lightning-thunder window, when static enables clearest contact. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to encode, to sing, to merge her melody with ghost code. Cost is felt in the transience of her medium (messages fade by dawn) and the loneliness of her audience (only dreamers below). Coincidence (lightning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her persistent, practiced will.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—privacy versus compassion—is signaled early via Mira’s habitual errands. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her thumb catching the temple unevenness initiates discovery, and choosing to read (not close) deepens stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she bears emotional weight (“hands steady despite the weight”) that alters her relationship to duty. Coincidence (Jansen forgetting goggles) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Mira’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving that absence leaves a record—is signaled early and deepens through Miriam’s cloud categorization. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from private exercise to public memorial, foreclosing the path of silent mourning. Cost is felt in her isolation and the physical tension of the gondola’s sway, but most sharply in the conceptual price: accepting that some losses can’t be retrieved, only mapped. Agency is clear—her attention becomes an act of resistance against oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge through transformation—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the coin encodes not data but a method. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to paint, not copy, accepting the cost of impermanence (the building will fall) for endurance (the sky lives in wood). The wrecking ball’s approach narrows time, but the real pressure is conceptual: can she translate fractal precision into paint? The answer forecloses mere archiving, demanding creation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—deciphering natural patterns to enable discovery—is signaled early and deepens when the starlings’ behavior shifts from spectacle to signal. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she measures, correlates, and interprets, narrowing options through relentless attention. The cost is credible (exhaustion, solitude) and visible in her stubbed pencil and burning eyes. However, the resolution leans slightly on coincidence—the hopscotch board’s presence feels fortuitous rather than earned—though it’s mitigated by thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and deepens when Thessa realizes the gears must be sacrificed, not used. This meaningful tightening forecloses her instrumental approach, forcing a shift from mechanic to mystic. Cost is legible: she loses her only tools to gain vision. While pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, the conflict lacks external friction—escalation is internal and textual, which slightly limits tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming neglected communal care—is signaled early via Mira’s messages and deepens through restoration labor. Escalation is driven by collective agency: ignoring messages → gathering → clearing beds → ringing bell. Cost is felt in physical exertion and emotional risk (Lena’s trust). Coincidence (butterflies emerging) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the decisive act is Eli’s intentional ring.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty at the edge of endings—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elara’s handling of the puppet and clock. The single meaningful tightening occurs when she presses her lips to the puppet’s forehead, triggering the clock’s acceleration: her agency drives the final documentation. Cost is unmistakable: all partial stories remain untold, yet witnessed; salvation is rejected for vouchsafing. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via density of lyrical motifs converging on the final chime, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before frost—tightens relentlessly via the birds’ cries and falling temperature. Agency is clear: Mira’s knowledge and action drive escalation. The cost is legible in her exhaustion and the ever-present “cold bite of the curse.” One meaningful deepening occurs when the blueprint’s smudges force her to trust memory, raising emotional and tactical stakes without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling professional devotion with filial guilt—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam recalls her mother’s dying words: “Your work matters.” The tightening occurs internally as she reinterprets absence as permission, not betrayal, foreclosing the path of self-punishment. Cost is felt in her weeping into the microscope post-funeral, and the final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure: her work *is* her atonement. Coincidence (finding the chrysalis) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency lies in her reinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping narrative potential through absence—is signaled early and deepens when the vendor finds the “glimmering parole” shelf, narrowing her focus from cataloging voids to activating specific gaps. Escalation is driven by her agency: selecting three bottles transforms passive observation into compositional act. Cost is unmistakable: she foregoes being a storyteller to become a midwife of unwritten tales, crystallized in Charged Poise where “options and stakes are made legible.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the lull is a chosen condition, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can Miriam transmute collective remorse without drowning in it—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the pavilion is “brittle with weight.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from absorption to counter-cooking, narrowing her tactic to flavor-based alchemy. Agency is clear: her professional skill becomes salvation. Cost is felt in her throat-tight grief and final fragility—she pays with her nervous system, not luck or external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating communal connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elara leverages language to crack grief’s calcification. The tightening occurs when she states, not asks, about the regulator springs, forcing a trade-off between pride and reconciliation. Cost is unmistakable: years of silence, stolen heritage, and personal labor. Agency drives escalation; luck complicates (stolen cuckoo) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost human aspiration—is signaled early through Mira’s “helix-minded” frustration with linear solutions. Pressure escalates when the mirror delivers entangled memories, forcing her to integrate them via modification. The deepening is protagonist-driven: she *chooses* to alter the mirror, thereby accepting the burden of others’ dreams. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits her former engineering self. However, the absence of a concrete obstacle (e.g., physical danger, time pressure) softens the escalation slightly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost methods of preservation—is signaled early and deepens as Calyx realizes the “combinations” are perceptual patterns, not codes. The single meaningful tightening occurs at the three-mouth junction, where past fear is overcome through agency. Cost is felt: two decades of forbidden return, and the understanding that this knowledge will isolate her further (“the archivist who had forbidden her return would find her changed”). Escalation is driven by her choices, not luck, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and deepens when the insulator’s stress cracks become instruments of empathy. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for sound but engineers a bridge between industry and nature. The cost is conceptual (music’s rarity) and felt (the world’s collective breath-held silence), crystallized when the siskin answers. No coincidence resolves; the harmony emerges from her precise, patient action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving dignity and purpose amid exile—is signaled early and deepened through the eclipse metaphor and recurring visits to the nexus. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes waiting itself is teaching, foreclosing despair without action. Agency manifests as endurance and attention, not decision, fitting the Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens. Cost is felt: the lost covenant, the queen’s fear, the council’s judgment—all weigh on his quiet resolve, though escalation leans more on lyrical accumulation than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering access to her catalog of silences—is signaled early and deepens when neighbors advocate force, testing her pacifism. The tightening occurs when fireworks approach: time pressure forces her to trust intuition over tools. Agency is clear: she chooses resonance over rupture, and the cost (potential permanent loss) sharpens every beat. Coincidence (firework timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the note arises from her sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightened by the corpse flower’s repulsive development, which forces Kalia to choose between flight and presence. Her agency drives escalation: each doodled journal entry marks a micro-renunciation of control. The cost is palpable—frustration, nausea, isolation—and crystallizes in the bloom scene, where enduring rot becomes the price of wisdom. No coincidence resolves tension; the flower’s timing arises from her sustained attention, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens when Cora touches the arrow tip. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to follow water flows, reach for the artifact, and ultimately leave it. Cost is unmistakable: she forgoes potential profit or acclaim to uphold a lineage of stewardship. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the moral calculus sharpens cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the true cause of the disaster—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the evacuation was foresight, not panic. The meaningful tightening occurs at the amphitheater: wind patterns confirm her “singular convergence” theory, foreclosing the official mechanical-failure narrative. Cost is felt—she stands alone, bearing the burden of knowledge the military will soon demand. Agency is clear: her survey choices drive the revelation, though the “rapidly adapting” trait lacks visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Yara lifts the bell but delays ringing, aligning her action with the sculptor’s chisel-strike. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to unfetter perception, triggering the cavern’s transformation. Cost is unmistakable: tears freeze on her cheeks, and the world’s “slow cooling” is only arrested through her sacrifice of passive observation for active certification.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after failure—is signaled early and tightens at Listener’s Crossing, where Kira confronts her three-heartbeat paralysis. The meaningful deepening comes through her shift from guilt-driven penance to conceptual repricing of guardianship. Cost is felt (exile, silence, burden of memory), though escalation relies more on reflection than external pressure; still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and density increase suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transcribing the mathematics of emotion before stars vanish—is signaled early and tightens as the halo fragment pulses with each disappearance. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to hold the fragment, triggering her dissolution, a trade-off that narrows her options from observer to participant. Cost is unmistakable: her selfhood fragments into borrowed light, yet the presses continue, implying endurance with sacrifice. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each vanished star raising the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—extending brief encounters beyond their moment—is signaled early via the pendant’s mystery and deepened when Mira reveals its true function. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Elara’s choice to hold the pendant up triggers the apparition, and her silent endurance of grief becomes active stewardship. The cost is felt as emotional labor—three years of scattered confidence—and crystallized in Mira’s departure: “I gave you the chance to become what I couldn’t stay to watch you become.” This sacrifice reweights the ordinary courier work into legendary possibility, with clear stakes for future encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—proving emotional residue—is signaled early and deepens when Mira sees her own reflection merged with her grandmother’s, realizing she’s become part of the archive. This isn’t passive discovery but active reconfiguration: her life’s work shifts from observation to embodiment. The cost is legible—her essence “slowly merging with the stone”—and the tightening occurs when the prism reveals not just others’ emotions but her own contribution. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sending a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when the spinner realizes completion requires self-unraveling. This escalation stems from her agency: she interprets the bead’s glow, recalls her grandmother’s smile, and chooses scissors over preservation. The cost is unmistakable: her consciousness flows into the bead, her body erased. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density (whispers released, silence growing louder) until the final cadence shift—true silence—reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—coaxing life from blight—is signaled early and deepens when Cael descends into toxic mines. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his deliberate tunnel-clearing narrows survival options to subterranean renewal. Cost is felt in neighbors’ initial dismissal and his unseen labor. Coincidence (finding untouched roots) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his agency (weaving silk, planting seedlings) earns the awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering withheld truth about her mentor and condition—is signaled early and deepens into self-confrontation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kira realizes she’s been chasing herself across cycles, foreclosing the hope of external salvation. Agency drives escalation: her act of pressing the shard initiates the cognitive shift. Cost is felt in the acceptance of eternal weaving, though the “price” of her dissociation could be more viscerally dramatized during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—acknowledging the drowned—is signaled early via the dark lamp and Ashford’s refusal to leave. Pressure escalates through accumulating stone stacks, culminating in Maren’s decisive act. The tightening is meaningful: each new stack narrows options until only ritual remains. Cost is felt—she inherits her grandmother’s unfinished business—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over active resistance, hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guiding ships through unseen channels—is signaled early and deepens as three vessels emerge. The tightening comes through escalating focus: from laughter to whisper, from one ship to three. Agency is clear: his words and light actively steer fate. Cost is felt in his solitude and burden, though the escalation leans more lyrical than causal; under Accumulative lens, this suffices, but lacks a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding narrative magnetism—is signaled early and deepens through Yuen’s quiet attention to the wing. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes such magnetism stems from receptivity, not innate talent, which reconfigures his identity and future actions (teaching apprentices to receive). The cost is conceptual but felt: he must relinquish the idea of mastery as creation alone and embrace vulnerability as vessel. Though pressure is internal and accumulative, it lacks a second live option foreclosed, slightly limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—measuring and bearing human sorrow—is signaled early and deepens through the sextant’s use. The tightening occurs when the labyrinth “unfolds” under her gaze, transforming confusion into clarity at emotional cost. Agency lies in witnessing, not solving; pressure accumulates texturally, not through external opposition. Coincidence (the pin’s sound) triggers focus, not resolution—consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindling hope in a dying realm—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s ritual, which demands personal erasure. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her choice to sing the Binding Chant triggers the greenhouse’s exhale and her own dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: “freedom purchased through constraint,” her memories burned to fuel the dawn. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens until the final, irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to answer her sister’s plea—is signaled early and tightens at midnight, when the Society’s transformation forces crystallization. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to reread the letter, sit in the Errors section, and wait for the ritual deepens her understanding. Cost is unmistakable (emotional paralysis, years of silence) and shapes the final poise. However, the “transformation” of the building remains atmospheric rather than causally pressuring—coincidence flirts with resolution, slightly muting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the sacred in ordinary persistence—tightens meaningfully when the bread appears, forcing a choice: reject it as irrelevant or accept it as absolution. Elara’s agency shines in her ritual response, which deepens the theme without resolving external pressure. The cost is felt: she tends what is vanishing, knowing full well its impermanence. Escalation is subtle but decisive under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving meaning before vows dissolve—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist discovers transformation, not mere fading. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to reinterpret rather than mourn, shifting from measurement to transcription. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: relinquishing binding magic for fragile human retelling. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern deepening (gold compassion → remembered mercy), not external opposition, and culminates in a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured with undeniable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning her father’s fate—is signaled early and tightened through three false starts that teach Mara patience and market rhythm. The final confrontation narrows options to a binary: surrender the fob or “capture the sound yourself.” Cost is unmistakable: either lose her last relic of her father or assume the unbearable weight of his broken trust. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency (her observation, waiting, questioning), not coincidence. Sunrise acts as a live clock, compressing tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether truth can be known through wonder as well as doubt—is signaled early and tightened when Seren appears, embodying the very phenomenon Mira questions. The meaningful deepening occurs when Mira tastes rain and recognizes the compass as a bridge, not just a tool. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: accepting that some truths require belief means relinquishing the safety of pure skepticism. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (descending, tasting, interpreting), and the forest election provides a coherent external pressure that mirrors the internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rectifying creative suppression—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes her disapproval choked Elena’s art. The meaningful tightening occurs when she understands the painting isn’t to be completed but *initiated* by her, foreclosing her old identity as mere technician. Cost is felt in the weight of that brushstroke-to-come; agency lies in choosing vulnerability over control. Escalation is driven by Mira’s perception shifts, not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival lies—is signaled early and tightens when Mira deciphers the hidden coordinates, narrowing options to pilgrimage or surrender. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow the map, count turns, enter the wall. Cost is felt in the wilting of her师傅 and now in her own burden of voicing his silence. Coincidence never resolves; the map’s discovery is earned through prior loyalty to craft and mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile truth in a post-linguistic world—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s sculptural work, which forecloses easy communication (no words, only resonance). The meaningful deepening occurs when Juniper’s silent approval confirms the fragment’s “color of wonder” still holds, validating Elara’s lifelong sacrifice. Cost is felt in her seasonal muteness and the valleys’ reliance on her art for communal listening. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (tuning, waiting, witnessing) under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a world where orientation fails—is signaled early and deepens when the roses begin dying. Cara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses not repair but transformation, miniaturizing chaos through understanding. The cost is unmistakable: she fragments even as she integrates, bearing the weight of childhood fears until they “fit into a space smaller than a memory.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each fear folded tightens the thematic coil—culminating in a stance that forecloses old solutions with visceral sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether stories deserve witness—is signaled early and deepens when Elena chooses to spread the letters rather than archive them. Pressure escalates through Elena’s agency: her curiosity leads to listening, which enables reconciliation. The cost is felt (the grandmother’s lifelong burden, the sister’s decades of silence), though the escalation leans more on revelation than active narrowing of options. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the mailbox’s unlocking suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—liberating the cure through encrypted defiance—is signaled early and deepens as Mira’s dance becomes the key. Escalation is driven by her agency: every journal entry, every throw of the dice, every step is tactical. The cost (permanent voice loss, isolation, risk of failure) is felt throughout and crystallizes in the calm before drainage. Coincidence never resolves; even the spider’s presence reflects Mira’s own patient construction of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering the mother’s deleted memory—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s agency: she exhumed the grave, reads coffee grounds, descends the chamber. The whale’s death escalates pressure by cracking open the world’s memory-hoarding system, but Mira’s choices drive the turn. Cost is felt in the weight of orphaned memories and the irreversible reconfiguration of her identity. Gravity’s fluctuation isn’t coincidence—it’s a lived constraint that guides her path, making the final approach both physical and emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—hushing a coercive prophecy—is signaled early and deepens when the summoner realizes it’s a future self’s plea. Her agency lies in attention: choosing to listen without being consumed. The tightening occurs when smoothing silence alters the medium itself, foreclosing violent counter-magic. Cost is unmistakable: she walks away from court power into solitary understanding, the “tranquil blaze” burning with irreversible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why Elena belongs here—intensifies through weekly sessions until the meteor shower forces confrontation. The tightening occurs when Elena realizes the tutor “had been there before Elena was born,” narrowing options to either demand truth or accept mystery. Her choice to forgo interrogation carries conceptual cost: relinquishing lineage for belonging. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each beat deepening the weight of silence without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether memory can survive death as presence—is signaled early and deepened through Mira’s handling of the shell. The tightening occurs when whispers resolve into dialogue, forcing her to choose between dismissal and belief. Agency is clear: she *listens with the part of herself that had always secretly believed*, a renunciation of professional armor with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory density, not external threat, culminating in a crystallized stance that forecloses her former self.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring buried truth—is signaled early and deepens into a moral reckoning with inherited silence. Escalation occurs through Yuki’s agency: she interprets the key’s true function, works through the night, and chooses to carry knowledge, not documents. The cost is palpable: she unlinks from complicity but assumes lifelong risk. Pressure tightens via the accumulating weight of generational betrayal, not external threats, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring stolen voices—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes echo people are “made, not born.” The celestial alignment creates a live clock that tightens tactics: she must be ready at the crest. Her agency lies in attention and endurance, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (infinite loneliness) and felt in the closing image, though a tangible forfeiture (e.g., breaking the seashell, sacrificing hearing) would have made price unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—naming the lost child—is signaled early and deepens through dream analysis, narrowing options until only exposure remains. The tightening occurs when the photograph emerges from the snow globe, forcing action. Cost is felt: the protagonist risks disrupting dormant grief across coastal towns. However, escalation leans on accumulation rather than active resistance; no external pressure tests her resolve, slightly muting agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and intensified through Yuki’s solitary vigil, culminating in the whistle that risks foolishness for connection. The tightening occurs when she chooses vulnerability (whistling like a girl) over stoic endurance, narrowing her options to authenticity. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she accepts being seen as strange to honor invisible labor. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens—each observation deepens commitment until the final act reconfigures meaning without altering external circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—excavating obscured truth—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s reconstruction work, culminating in a Charged Poise where she accepts truth’s futility against myth. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her choice to reassemble letters, interpret the diamond, and transmit findings narrows options (she can’t unsee the truth) and incurs conceptual cost (isolation, irrelevance). The factions’ competing narratives apply off-page pressure, but the on-page conflict remains tightly focused. A slight deduction for lack of tangible consequence beyond resignation—cost is felt but not dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering fragmented prophecy to catalyze renewal—is signaled early and deepens as the storm intensifies and the radio shifts from static to clarity. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she listens, interprets, steps forward. The cost is palpable—seven years of solitude, institutional betrayal—and crystallizes in the final moment when she accepts the prophet’s arrival. Though coincidence (storm timing) complicates, resolution stems from her sustained attention, not external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether sounds are mere recordings or vessels of human connection—is signaled early and deepened decisively when the music box triggers emotional unraveling. The poet’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen rather than capture, then to relinquish the box, then to rewrite his craft. Cost is legible: he surrenders possession, revises his identity, and trades pity-coins for meaningful commissions. The tightening occurs not through external threat but through internal recalibration under the Accumulative lens, which is valid and potent here.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the harbor via harmonic stabilization—is signaled early and tightens when the crystal’s C-sharp “warps jagged.” Maren’s agency drives escalation: she adapts tuning in real-time, narrowing options to millimeter adjustments. Cost is felt in bodily exhaustion and psychological burden (“could not let the harbor become a tomb”). No coincidence; resolution stems from her trained intuition meeting ancestral duty under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping unclaimable horizons through patient revolution—is signaled early and deepens when the viaduct emerges, narrowing Kira’s focus to liberation of bound energies. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to track moon paths, approaches the ridge despite compass chaos, places her palm on warm stone. Cost is felt in the acknowledgment that her revolution “would not be achieved in her lifetime,” yet she persists. Coincidence (autumn rains awakening the viaduct) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kira’s readiness makes the discovery meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering silenced truths—is signaled early and tightens when Elena realizes Chen’s complicity. Her agency drives escalation: empirical observation leads to memory resonance, which fuels her decision to publish independently. Cost is visible: professional risk, severed mentorship, potential retaliation. The drought’s end isn’t just backdrop—it’s the catalyst that makes truth physically resurface, raising the stakes from archival curiosity to moral imperative.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether mechanical repair suffices for complex grief—is signaled early and deepens when Thomas recalls Marcus Webb’s question about deserving. The tightening occurs when he chooses not just to fix the spring but to inscribe a hidden blessing, foreclosing the simpler path of pure technical restoration. Cost is legible: three days of labor, emotional investment, and the quiet burden of carrying another’s unresolved regret. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating the universe’s poetry—tightens when the arrow tip enables coherent patterns, foreclosing the cart glider’s original purpose. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: obsessive experimentation narrows options until the final turn (inserting the tip into the scope) becomes inevitable. Cost is unmistakable: social ostracization (“thought me mad”) and functional obsolescence, crystallized in the Charged Poise of ringing an unheard bell while committing to continued work. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each kaleidoscope turn deepens understanding, raising stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus corporate erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Maren learns the Prometheus didn’t crash. The tightening occurs when she realizes the company sent her the case to either recover or permanently bury Yuki’s work. Her agency drives escalation: each number traced is a deliberate act against institutional silence. Cost is unmistakable: she must choose between complicity and becoming a ghost herself, crystallized in the final line’s commitment to “follow the numbers into the silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sustaining meaningful safety through understanding, not illusion—is signaled early via the apple trees planted against winter hunger. The tightening occurs when Mira sees her layered selves in the mirror and receives the fragment, forcing a choice: seek wholeness or wield brokenness. Her agency drives escalation—she doesn’t wait for ships but walks out to meet them. Cost is felt: she accepts irreparable loss (“some things could not be made whole”) yet acts anyway, reweighting mercy as active intervention, not passive hope.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—is signaled early and deepens through trawling, which narrows her options from clinical detachment to embodied acceptance. Agency lies in attention: she chooses disaster relief to confront raw endings, and that choice crystallizes her stance. Cost is unmistakable: she trades potential endurance (her grandmother’s path) for release, with the parasol tip as sole heirloom witness. Pressure tightens via environmental immersion, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to hold onto Mira’s ghost or release it—is signaled early and tightens when Elias handles the burned fragment. The meaningful deepening occurs in his realization that their mismatch was beautiful *because* of their differences. Cost is felt: he forfeits reunion but gains acceptance. Agency is internal but decisive; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one resonant intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom in a world that no longer listens—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s communion with the parapet and clearings. The meaningful tightening occurs when she recalls being asked why she walks; the answer crystallizes not as justification but as ontological necessity (“the dunes hold what is given to them”). Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not action, yet the cost is palpable: isolation, the weight of being the sole rememberer. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening suffices, though the lack of external pressure slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—making forgotten pain visible—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s quiet labor. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses not to reconstruct missing faces but to suggest “footprints in snow,” accepting absence as part of truth. This renunciation carries conceptual cost: healing requires room for grief, not completion. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is subtle rather than sharp. The story avoids coincidence; agency lies entirely in Maren’s attention, which qualifies as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to language’s end—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal amplifies the building’s “testimony.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he takes the crystal, interprets its sounds, and chooses to return it. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: silence becomes the only honest speech, and no new words will ever be added. One meaningful tightening suffices, though pressure remains largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s precognitive forgetfulness, which narrows her options to ritualized markers. The escalation is textural but decisive: as she follows the driftwood path, the accumulated hush of videotapes builds pressure until the revelation reframes the entire search—not as loss but as witness. The cost is legible in her years of misdirected effort and the quiet surrender of prophecy for perception. Though no antagonist opposes her, the conflict is internal and environmental, cohering under the Accumulative lens: the garden itself tests her stance, and her endurance becomes agency when she stops seeking the future and finally hears the past.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral—is signaled early and tightens when the tremor forces action. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to reframe, not fix. Cost is felt in the surrender of his father’s promise and forty years of futile hope. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shift and image density, culminating in the leaf’s descent as both method and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s agency: she chooses to work while dying, calls Margery’s daughter, and selects specific objects to hymn the mundane. The tightening occurs when her own mortality becomes the very lens through which she performs care, raising the cost (each act may be her last). No coincidence resolves tension; Margery’s peace emerges from Elara’s deliberate, costly attention. The price—foregoing self-preservation for service—is legible in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—solving where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that theory is insufficient. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for answers but descends, searches, and physically enacts the solution. The cost is conceptual and personal: she must abandon textbook definitions and trust embodied ritual, risking failure in solitude. The tightening occurs when she chooses movement over meditation, foreclosing passive scholarship. Coincidence (finding the key) is earned by her deliberate search beneath warped timekeepers.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming maternal mistakes into something bearable—is signaled early and tightened when Elara refuses to confirm the body’s identity, foreclosing societal closure. Her agency drives escalation: placing the tooth reweights the garden’s meaning under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts lifelong ambiguity (“some fractures were never meant to mend”) while relinquishing vengeance or answers. The deepening—linking bone setting to soul-setting—narrows her path to ritual over resolution, with emotional price felt in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming connection to lost light—is signaled early and deepens when the clouded pearl surfaces. Escalation is protagonist-driven: Elira’s decision to polish (not discard) the pearl narrows options and unlocks radiance. Cost is unmistakable: she must confront seventeen years of unprocessed grief to release the light. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening occurs via cadence shift—from solitary mourning to shared sanctuary—with tangible consequence: travelers now find refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling public exposure with private healing—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s choice to withhold their whereabouts, a quiet act of “protected vulnerability.” Pressure escalates texturally: headlines → grocery whispers → hospital memory → present solitude. The tightening occurs in the refusal to burden the mother further, foreclosing emotional disclosure with visible cost (isolation, unshared refuge). Agency is subtle but consistent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—creative rebirth—is signaled early via the “hollow in her chest.” Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses to enter the nexus, confronts her ghosts, and reinterprets failure as offering. The tightening occurs when she shifts from mourning to solemnizing, foreclosing the path of self-recrimination. Cost is legible: years lost, stories abandoned. However, escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than causal narrowing of options, slightly weakening under strict Causal lens—but fits Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the moonvine before knowledge vanishes—is signaled early and tightens through the narrowing window of alignment. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her humming intensifies, triggering golden threads and transformation. Cost is felt in decades of solitary study and the risk of total failure. Yet the pressure lacks a tangible trade-off or loss mid-beat; success arrives cleanly, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating a map to guide others through death—is signaled early and deepens through tactile ritual. Pressure escalates via physical and metaphysical demands: stillness, precise arrangement, alchemical ignition. The tightening occurs when Elara lifts the flash-paper: one chance, no margin for error. Cost is felt in her knees on cold earth and the irreversible release of preserved light—agency lies in her choice to give it away, not keep it for herself.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—harvesting echoes to redirect the timer’s purpose—is signaled early and deepens through Elira’s realization that “repair was not about restoring function but about redirecting purpose.” Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her choice to study reflection angles narrows options (no disassembly) and raises the cost (work measured in seasons). The wounded season’s lull creates a live temporal constraint that tightens decisions. Cost is unmistakable: she commits to years of labor in service of wonder over mechanical function.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—relieving unbearable weight by weaving it into pattern—is signaled early and deepens as the weaver’s own body turns to stone. The meaningful tightening occurs when she adds the final thread, accepting total assimilation. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is conveyed through intensifying sensory layers and the visible progression of calcification. The cost is unmistakable: she gains permeability and connection but loses her body, autonomy, and temporality. Agency lies in her continued orientation toward the center, even as it consumes her.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming absence into presence through craft—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she carves despite exhaustion, ignores the kettle, chooses glass eyes last. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes “the eyes were the last thing to finish, the moment when the work decided whether to live”—a turn that narrows options to completion or surrender. Cost is unmistakable: the forgotten tea, the hollowed self now filled only by shavings and memory. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s method of collecting others’ abandoned futures, which tightens pressure by accumulating evidence of universal failure. The meaningful escalation occurs when the camera captures not the ghost but the collective fragments, forcing Mira to articulate her plea: rest, not restoration. Cost is unmistakable in the “erosion” of ambition to “granular goal” and the final exhaustion that forecloses further argument. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming communal hope through infrastructure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara pivots from academic mapping to active restoration. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to redirect aquifer flow, narrowing options to a 17-day gamble with visible cost: time, effort, and the risk of failure in a town already hollowed by loss. Agency is clear; coincidence (the carnival’s departure) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The escalation is driven by Mara’s ingenuity, not external luck, and the cost—emotional and civic—is felt in the quiet streets and council presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with an unfinished legacy—is signaled early and deepens through the act of offering the clock to silence. The protagonist’s agency lies in renunciation: he doesn’t finish the clock; he *winds* it, accepting impermanence. Cost is visible: twenty years of avoidance crystallize in one trembling turn of the key. The bear’s presence complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure remains internal and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why a river was erased—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes Konstantýn participated in the lie. This tightening reconfigures her goal from discovery to interpretation, narrowing options to forensic reading rather than excavation. Agency is clear: her training instincts drive every pivot, and the cost is conceptual—accepting that truth is constructed, not found. However, the escalation lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., time, safety, tool), slightly muting the pressure’s physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding ancestral knowledge—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s decoding of the rope. The tightening occurs when the fulgurite reveals hidden logic, forcing a shift from passive inheritance to active continuation. Agency is quiet but decisive: he chooses to plant specific seeds, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the burden of being the last weaver—and felt in the “oceanic hush” that settles into his bones.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing through documented absence—is signaled early and deepens when the traveler realizes she herself will become an “explained absence.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she accepts her lateness not as failure but as entry into the garden’s logic. Cost is felt: she forfeits departure to become part of what she studies. Escalation is driven by her agency (writing, touching the thread, choosing to stay), though the pressure remains contemplative rather than urgent—appropriate for an Accumulative/Textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—tightens when the prince abandons destruction for integration, foreclosing his father’s path. The deepening occurs via the egg’s revelation, which reframes the Engine’s sacrifice as symbiosis, not loss. Cost is felt in the renunciation of vengeance, though the mechanical world’s “tyranny” remains abstractly opposed. Escalation is driven by discovery, not agency—the prince reacts more than acts—but the Accumulative lens justifies this as density intensifies toward the closing insight.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited trauma into protective purpose—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s ritual at the lagoon, culminating in her realization that "her father's flames and her own water were part of the same eternal dance." Agency manifests as attention and endurance (kneeling, remembering, choosing daily to return to duty), foreclosing the path of passive victimhood with felt cost: "not healed but healing." Pressure tightens via the Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (coin’s ember-glow, sand’s ancient weight) reweights her commitment without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating imprisoned memories—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s progressive understanding of the breadcrumbs as instructions. Agency resides in her refusal to abandon the mystery, culminating in the unstick process that demands sidereal patience. Cost is visible: emotional labor, temporal investment, and the burden of stewardship. Escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence; each fountain deepens her commitment and narrows her interpretive path.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring ancestral duty while navigating obsolescence—is signaled early and deepens when the gear awakens autonomously, transforming passive custodianship into active witness. The tightening occurs not through external opposition but internal revelation: Vael realizes the gear was never inert, only waiting. Cost is conceptual (loss of control over legacy) and felt in the “troubling serenity.” Though escalation lacks causal turns, it succeeds under Accumulative lens via cadence shift and pattern break at the gear’s first tick.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding collective grief’s “shape”—tightens meaningfully when butterflies ascend, forcing Elara to witness transience as communal movement. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to speak the poem aloud catalyzes the migration’s lift, linking voice to release. Cost is felt in her abandoned workshop tools and deferred epitaph, though the ghosts’ sudden crowd slightly risks convenience. Still, pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with dusk’s deepening violet acting as live clock that narrows reflection time.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s attempt to “emerge from the weight of what he had done”—is signaled early and deepens through his ritual. The 37-second pause forces a trade-off: relive his negligence fully or remain numb. His agency drives escalation—he chooses remembrance over evasion, carving confessions weekly, adjusting the pendulum for “balance” not accuracy. The cost is unmistakable: he carries guilt “evenly across the years” but never escapes it, foreclosing any path to forgiveness. Coincidence (the pub visit) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to show up weekly is the sole engine of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether secret mercy was understood—is signaled early via the tapestry’s border and deepens through decoding. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally: each unraveled thread intensifies thematic weight, not tactical options. The gardener’s agency lies in attention, not action, which fits the Situational lens but limits visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the “tightening” is intellectual, not consequential, though the emotional resonance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping unknown futures without false certainty—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s rejection of “easy certainty” in favor of “informed possibility.” Pressure tightens via internal conflict: the tension between predictive modeling and cosmic accident (the feather’s arrival). Agency is clear: she chooses constellation over prophecy, constraint over freedom. Cost is conceptual (foregoing definitive answers) and emotional (solitude), legible in the “weighty” quill and “fractured” ice. Escalation is protagonist-driven and lens-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping stories alive in a world that forbids them—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s discovery that dust “remembers.” Her agency lies in attention and endurance: choosing to broadcast despite patrols, coaxing narratives from particles. The meaningful tightening occurs when she moves from copying scores to teaching dust to speak—a higher-risk, more intimate form of resistance. Cost is felt in constant vigilance, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of discovery, all legible in the amber-glow concealment and cloth-wrapped radio.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—how to represent someone fundamentally elusive—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s ritual: each act (breaking porcelain, burning portrait) narrows options toward incompleteness as the only honest form. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, culminating in ash-filled shards that foreclose any illusion of wholeness. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of childhood safety, the surrender of definitive truth, the weight of unanswered questions carried forward. No coincidence resolves tension; pressure coheres through tactile, irreversible choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned myth—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s archival labor. Escalation occurs via accumulation: each recovered artifact intensifies the moral burden of knowing. The tightening is internal but decisive: choosing continued work despite futility. Cost is conceptual (isolation, irrelevance) and felt in the closing lines. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the absence of an external test or tangible consequence slightly limits the visceral stakes expected at this elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether vanishing arts can survive through patient listening—is signaled early and deepens when the refugee student enters. Eleanor’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the scale, embodying her “subtracting noise” method. Cost is felt in her history (“throat closed tight by hatred”) and the student’s swallowed consonants; the tightening forecloses performative harmony in favor of vulnerable coexistence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving embodied, uncommodifiable wisdom—is signaled early and tightens when Elena consumes the seed, irrevocably binding herself to the keepers’ legacy. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her dream-pull, kneeling, pruning, and ingestion all narrow options toward rebellion-as-cultivation. Cost is felt in the dissolution of her prior autonomy (she becomes a vessel) and the labor of rebuilding. Coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is her choice to prune.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring light through wonder—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes routine alone is insufficient. The meaningful deepening occurs at the riddle’s revelation: the conflict shifts from logistical (weighing jars) to existential (reigniting awe). Agency is subtle but present: Elara chooses to climb, to read aloud, to trust Mira. Cost is felt—her lifelong identity as mere toll keeper must be shed—but the escalation leans slightly on epiphany over sustained tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s agency: she *chooses* to read displacements as communication. The tightening occurs when the shard grows warm, forcing her to accept non-rational knowledge. Cost is felt in the quiet surrender of empirical certainty for ancestral attunement. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. nuance—is signaled early and deepens when the ampoule’s memory reframes foxglove as both poison and remedy. Thalassor’s agency drives escalation: he actively seeks living perspectives (eels, oysters), transforming his telepathy from command to curiosity. The cost is felt in his renunciation of static guardianship, crystallized when he projects understanding—not warning—to the diver. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding over escape—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes the rupture must be conceptual, not physical. Her agency drives escalation: each dice roll tests hypotheses, narrowing interpretive paths until the dismissed formula resurfaces. Cost is felt in the vertigo of late understanding and the forfeiture of hope’s comfort. Coincidence (the dice landing on key formulas) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from her methodical reinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—proving kindness endures beyond memory—is signaled early and deepens when the daydream reveals the language as a chain of anonymous grace. Mira’s agency drives the escalation: her decision to paint the decoded phrase transforms private insight into public offering. The cost is felt as the dissolution of her “long loneliness,” a psychological burden lifted only after creation. While the turn hinges on a vision, it emerges from established conditions (moonlight + brush + symbols), avoiding deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—cultural survival versus state erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the thaw introduces discovery risk. Maren’s agency lies not in battle but in reconfiguration: she shifts from preservation-in-hiding to dissemination, crystallizing stance through the bread ritual and final walk. The cost is felt in the beekeeper’s absence and the fragility of their sanctuary, and escalation arises organically from environmental change (thaw) rather than coincidence. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from memory to movement tightens pressure with visible emotional and existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defying predetermined fate—is signaled early and deepens through Iris’s reverse-engineering of the yoyo. Escalation is driven by her agency: each solved sequence intensifies the latent radiance until reality unwinds. Cost is unmistakable: annihilation of her world. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the tide’s return renders the stone irrelevant only because she has already transcended its domain.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting fear as a door rather than a monster—is signaled early via grandmother’s secret and tightens decisively when Clara confesses her desire to sink. This act, driven by agency under Accumulative pressure, narrows options: she either surrenders to photographic corruption or speaks truth to the mirror. The cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the allure of oblivion, dimming her resurrection glow, and bearing the weight of survival. Coincidence never resolves; every escalation stems from Clara’s choices within the funhouse’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rendering the ocean’s chaos intelligible—is signaled early and deepens as clouds and waves escalate. The prophet’s agency drives escalation: she times strikes to meet waves, harmonizing destruction. Cost is felt in the physical toll (“pulse through her arm”) and existential solitude. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density (layered resonances) and cadence shift (harder strike → higher pitch), culminating in harmonic acceptance of chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the vanished expedition—is clear from paragraph two and tightens when Mira deciphers the pattern-language question about the watchers. Her decision to blow the whistle escalates pressure by risking Council taboo and possibly awakening dormant forces. Cost is legible: she trades safety for revelation, and the glowing spiral implies consequences cannot be undone. Agency drives escalation; coincidence merely haunts the periphery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose a noble lie—is signaled early and deepens through Dr. Vance’s archival method and moral calculus. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses publication despite personal cost, foreclosing communal harmony and ancestral reverence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each layer of myth construction intensifies the ethical weight. Cost is unmistakable (“disturb the town that had honored her grandfather”), though the lack of external opposition limits tactical adaptation, keeping this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the residue of abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Maren shifts from observer to participant. The tightening occurs when she chooses to leave notes in the crumbling foundation, foreclosing pure detachment. Agency is clear: her method is a deliberate counter to provincial record-keeping. Cost is felt physically (cold, isolation) and existentially (bearing others’ unfinished work), and the tide’s rise imposes a live clock that shapes every move.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving suppressed truth—is signaled early and deepens when marginalia reveal a hidden archive. The blackout tightens pressure by removing artificial light, forcing Mira into a mode of perception that aligns with the founders’ cunning. Her agency lies in attention and interpretation, not action, but this fits the Accumulative lens: the meaningful turn is cognitive, not physical. Cost is conceptual (inheriting a dangerous legacy), though not viscerally dramatized; the price remains implied rather than embodied, slightly softening the escalation’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving private grief against institutional co-option—is signaled early and deepens when Mira stops building for the basilica. The meaningful tightening occurs in her method shift: gem polishing as prayer, crane folding as funeral rite. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is unmistakable: she endures luminous torment to keep her daughter’s dream unshared, a price paid in every folded crane.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some lives resolve and others dissolve—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s renunciation of conventional meaning-making. Escalation occurs via his intellectual pivot to perturbation theory, which narrows options to a single obsessive tactic: hunting “unused potential.” Cost is unmistakable: he trades communal grief for solitary calculus, enduring isolation as the price of his stance. The cooling circuit breakers provide a live clock that tightens focus without resolving the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes it’s not data to retrieve but a state already woven into existence. The tightening occurs at the lever-pull: she risks nothing tangible, yet the emotional cost is her surrender of the search itself. Agency is internal (attention, recognition), fitting the Accumulative lens. While pressure remains coherent, the lack of tangible opposition softens escalation—but the lens permits this, as stance crystallization replaces external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—confronting the truth of her father’s death—is signaled early and deepens when the watch hand reveals her ultimate betrayal. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to sift, to turn each carving, culminating in the discovery. The cost is unmistakable: fifteen years of corrupted memory and the burden of complicity. However, the escalation lacks a live tactical shift; the “sifting” method remains static, limiting the tightening to emotional rather than consequential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking cyclical violence—is signaled early and deepens when he decides “this would be the last exchange conducted in this ritual way.” His agency drives escalation: rejecting moon-phase synchronization in favor of irreversible action. Cost is unmistakable: releasing the heirlooms forfeits ancestral continuity for uncertain peace. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural logic—each layer of backstory tightens the moral calculus until renunciation becomes the only viable tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elara abandons celestial navigation for land markers, narrowing her world to survive it. The meaningful tightening occurs at the osprey nest: memory surfaces not as nostalgia but as proof she can still recognize continuity. Cost is felt in every regret listed, culminating in the quiet endurance of paddling despite broken vision. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choices under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding self through choice—is signaled early and deepens as hidden text reveals paths “not taken.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Vera realizes the labyrinth is “philosophical,” shifting from passive navigation to active reconstitution of identity. Cost is felt in the loss of innocence (no “magically materialized” empathy) and the burden of freedom without memory. Though the time traveler’s arrival borders on convenience, their role is interpretive, not rescuing—the resolution stems from Vera’s openness to wonder, not external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens through Lysara’s reluctant metamorphosis, which forecloses her human-only existence. The tightening occurs when she chooses to enact the ancestral rite, accepting the price of partial dehumanization. Agency is clear: she initiates the conjuring, breathes the scent, and reinterprets her brother’s presence. Cost is felt (“afraid, and ready”) and conceptual—love expands beyond death, but only by sacrificing a fixed human identity. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming squandered maternal time—is signaled early and deepens when the cartomancer realizes accumulation is illusion. The tightening occurs when she shifts from seeking to unfasten guilt to accepting it, foreclosing the path of magical restitution. Agency drives escalation: her decision to cut her palm with the saucer crystallizes stance under pressure. Cost is unmistakable: blood mingles with ink, and the irreversible truth that some debts dissolve only through release, not retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reopening a dimension through integrated compassion—is signaled early and deepens via Seraph’s realization that “shadow work had begun the moment the last human died.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to stitch the photos, violating archival purity for connection. Agency is clear: her needlework, not luck or external force, triggers the dimension’s bloom. Cost is felt: she risks desecration, carries ancestral grief, and trades preservation for activation—all visible in the pulsing photographs and rising body.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through the detour, which forecloses the coastal road and forces confrontation with prophecy. The tightening occurs when the eclipse begins and the bugs spell their message: Mara’s agency lies not in causing but in witnessing, a stance crystallized under celestial pressure. Cost is felt (“holding beauty she would never keep”) and visible in her destitution. While escalation is subtle, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the absence of a second on-page character slightly limits interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protecting the fort vs. igniting revolution—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the blackout reveals systemic fragility. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her analysis of angles and manipulation of the quill foreclose passive compliance. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: she trades institutional loyalty for revolutionary risk, crystallized in the final image of emergency lights casting “new shadows.” Coincidence (the blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn stems from her curiosity and method.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling her grandmother’s promise—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes catching was never the point. The Spiral of Catching Hold sequence forces a trade-off: spend all remaining star dust or never learn the truth. Agency drives escalation: her choice to place the final rock creates the living geometry. Cost is unmistakable: she risks total failure for understanding, and wins connection instead of control.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice after censorship—is signaled early and deepens when Mira reads her own words aloud, transforming private pain into public (if unheard) act. Agency is clear: she chooses to stop running, open the envelope, speak. The tightening occurs at the storm’s peak, forcing renunciation of waiting; cost is the vulnerability of speaking without guarantee of audience. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, with conceptual cost (truth requires darkness to develop) unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth as living discovery vs. rigid doctrine—is signaled early and tightens when Varn exploits the opponent’s philosophical rigidity, not physical weakness. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of symbolic detail (sundial, brook, arm) intensifies until the breakthrough. Agency is clear—Varn’s choice to redirect momentum embodies his epistemology. Cost is felt in the younger scholar’s loss of certainty, though the price to Varn (continued isolation) is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty amid institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens through shared confessions and collaborative acts. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mira reveals her hidden poems, risking exposure of her unstable identity; Delphine reciprocates with her musical past, narrowing emotional distance. Agency is expressed through attention and creation, not escape. Cost is felt in the precariousness of their midnight labor and the warden’s looming authority, though the absence of tangible consequence (e.g., punishment risk) slightly softens the escalation’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over grief through artistic ritual—is signaled early and deepens when Elias uses the film reel to access the arbor. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to play the specific piece Clara requested, transforming passive mourning into active tribute. Cost is felt in the calcified heart and the frozen clock, but the escalation leans slightly on conceptual elegance over visceral pressure. Protagonist agency drives every turn, satisfying the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory—is signaled early and tightens as the monsoon looms. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to ascend, to bind her mind, to interpret. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the seed wasn’t waiting for awakening but for trust—a shift in knowledge that reconfigures her role. Cost is legible: the dream-ways will be “washed clean,” and she accepts dispersal over preservation. However, the monsoon functions more as deadline than active antagonist, slightly muting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding unspoken rupture—is signaled early and deepens through lace interpretation, culminating in Marek’s realization that forgiveness requires releasing the need for closure. The tightening occurs when compass aligns with lace thread, narrowing his quest from geographic pursuit to internal reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons hope of reconciliation (“somewhere beyond the horizon… he hoped Elias was finding peace”) to tend his own garden. Agency drives escalation—his patient observation yields the decisive insight, not coincidence.
