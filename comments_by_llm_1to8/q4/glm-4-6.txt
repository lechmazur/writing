  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose after the attack—signals early and tightens once when the ledger/frost patterns force Kaelen to retrace the smuggler's steps, narrowing his options from passive mourning to active investigation. The mineshaft revelation (smuggler as protector, not criminal) deepens understanding and transforms Kaelen's artistic intention. Closure involves a renunciation with visible cost: embedding ash means abandoning pure luminosity for testimony. The reversal from "attack as silencing" to "gesture of creation" reshapes stakes, but the escalation remains cognitive rather than embodied—Kaelen faces no on-page tactical obstacle or live decision friction during the investigation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    One dominant stake is signaled early—rectifying silence into music—and the piece shows one meaningful tightening when the thermal scanner finally "displayed a cascade of colors, a symphony of warmth that pulsed in time with the vibrations." However, this tightening arrives without visible cost or trade-off; the protagonist works "for hours" without encountering a substantive obstacle or forced choice that narrows options. The resolution feels convenient rather than earned by prior struggle; no live option is foreclosed, and the protagonist's agency consists of persistence rather than a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—sending unquiet souls to rest—is signaled early and sustained. Marcus's underwater expeditions and the lens restoration provide one meaningful tightening, though the "three life-threatening dives" are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing felt risk. The resolution (lens repaired, spirits guided) is earned by Marcus's effort, but no visible trade-off or foreclosed option appears on the page. The piece delivers a successful outcome without testing Marcus's commitment through a choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring intergenerational support to ensure survival—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the repeated bell tolls and deliveries, with one meaningful turn when "other youths volunteered," their skepticism "slowly eroded." The anonymous nature of the donations is the tactical constraint that prevents glory-claiming and forces shared pride. Cost is implied (scarcity, "every crust was counted") and the final image reweights the opening isolation into communal bonds. However, the escalation is primarily told in summary ("The young began to notice," "Lena found herself lingering") rather than dramatized through a visible on-page choice with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared late (paragraph 5) and never tested by on-page opposition or scarcity. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elias's breathing method succeeds instantly without friction, cost, or adaptation. The passersby's healing happens off-stage as convenient result rather than earned reversal driven by protagonist agency. The lens remains unclear, so escalation cannot be judged coherently, and no credible price forecloses a path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (sever ties to the past/wife by destroying the fragment) is signaled early and tightens through the descent and tree confrontation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (garden shudders, bridges writhe, fragment heats) rather than plot reversals. Agency is present: Elias chooses to descend and raise the fragment at the tree. However, the resolution mechanism (merging fragment with tree triggers maze collapse) is not constrained by prior rules—it feels asserted. The cost ("she was gone, erased not by time but by his own hand") is felt but abstract; no concrete trade-off or visible forfeiture shapes the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (unlock the vault before the collapse) is signaled early and pressure rises through the collapsing wall and Kael's racing fingers. One meaningful tightening occurs when he misjudges the last note, forcing the chains-as-tools pivot. However, the escalation relies on external countdown rather than protagonist agency deepening the problem, and the final success—door opens, Kael collapses—lacks visible trade-off or renunciation; coincidence (the arrow's pattern) provides the key rather than a choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through layered description and Elias's sensory focus, but there is no meaningful tightening or reversal: he arrives, listens, captures the sound, and leaves satisfied. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off visible. The action proceeds smoothly from intent to completion without escalation or cost that would narrow his path or force a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—listening for destiny's secrets—is declared early but never tightened by opposition or cost. The portrait's silence is described as "profound," yet the thief's response is immediate philosophical acceptance rather than a forced trade-off. No meaningful escalation occurs; he kneels, traces, receives a smile, and concludes. The resolution (walking away) is not earned by prior causality but by an off-stage shift in understanding. Coincidence (the woman's smile) triggers the turn rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled: crafting an object that embodies "freezing and thaw." No on-page opposition, internal friction, or escalating cost tightens that pursuit. The shift from vase to teardrop is presented as revelation, not a forced choice with trade-offs. Agency is present (Finn decides, acts), but the lack of pressure or visible sacrifice caps the score. No reversal narrows options; the ending completes the concept without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaim identity stolen by betrayal—is declared but never tested by a live dilemma with visible cost. The protagonist works "methodically" to decrypt notes, yet no reversal narrows options; the betrayer's "confidence faltered" without showing what the protagonist risked or lost. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does agency: the climax summarizes rather than dramatizes a turn, and the claimed victory arrives without prior escalation or earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the map before the last star dies—is signaled early and tightens through the celestial countdown timeframe. One meaningful pressure point occurs when Kaelen discovers concentric circles suggesting a center, which "changed everything" and accelerates his work. However, this shift is told rather than shown through a concrete choice or trade-off, and the final "I am ready" moment arrives without on-page resistance or visible cost. Escalation reads more as accumulative urgency than a choice that narrows options, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking the dramatized price that would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—amalgamating fragmented timelines—is signaled early and tightens once when 734 plays the violin and sees overlapping versions of itself. However, 734 encounters no opposition, trade-off, or cost during execution; the violin simply works, the timelines merge, and dawn arrives. The resolution is delivered by a convenient object rather than protagonist choice under pressure, and no live option is foreclosed with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the registrar will engage or remain isolated—is signaled early and tightens when he steps into the forecourt. The doodle progression (broken key, cracked mirror, unbroken circle) provides one meaningful deepening: the second figure's shoulders relax, the first figure offers the ticket, and the registrar invites them in. However, the escalation is driven more by the figures' symbolic exchange than by the registrar's agency; his move into the forecourt and the tea offer are responses rather than choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. No trade-off or loss appears on the page—no risk that joining them might shatter his quiet or obligate him—so the tightening remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving that gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the withering garden, low luck score, and the researcher's scorn, but escalation remains atmospheric rather than driven by Elias's agency. The vine's transformation in the final third imposes the revelation on him; he does not force a choice or pay a visible price. The story offers a deepening (marbles appear arranged, reweighting his rituals) but lacks a tightening that narrows options or a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and pursued through lever pulls. Yet the escalation is mechanical rather than agonistic: each lever simply intensifies the display without a complicating reversal or visible tradeoff. No resource is spent, no alternate hypothesis ruled out with cost, no relationship strained. The final transmission to Earth occurs effortlessly; convenience plotting replaces earned discovery. One tightening (third lever shift in perception) exists but carries no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (decode and honor Isabella's lost composition) is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or cost. The musician encounters no friction—every step (retrieval, recognition, decoding, performance, ghost appearance) succeeds on first attempt. No reversal, no failed attempt, no trade-off. The resolution grants him proof, completion, and spectral gratitude without a single on-page price or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through the smudging actions that progressively narrow interpretive options. Each smudge deepens understanding (truth as absence, brother's erasure by disbelief), culminating in an on-page cost: shouldering the brother's silenced warning. The price is felt ("permanent twilight"), though escalation leans on introspection rather than external complication, and the brother's erasure is recounted rather than shown, limiting immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and drives Elias's journey, but escalation is minimal: he walks, finds the wheel, plays the tape, turns it, and feels relief. The single tightening (turning the wheel under the psychic's frantic call) provides atmospheric pressure but no visible cost or trade-off that narrows options. The resolution arrives through coincidence (the valve's convenient presence) and the psychic's recorded voice calming as he turns the wheel borders on magical convenience. Agency is present (he chooses to turn) but the stakes never genuinely tighten or force a difficult choice with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.1)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The keeper's stated motivation—"to witness change without judgment"—operates as passive observation with no on-page conflict, reversal, or tightening that narrows options. The journey to the refuge and back is frictionless; no cost, obstacle, or competing pressure appears. Agency is absent: no decision, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path. The piece circles thematic atmosphere without escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching Leo—is signaled early but never tightened. Maya plays, Leo taps, Leo speaks: each step is additive rather than a reversal that forecloses an alternative approach. No visible cost appears on the page; the eclipse provides atmospheric cover but does not force a trade-off or test Maya's method against a complicating pressure. The "weeks later" report of piano lessons is off-page outcome, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the Dream Extinction—remains intellectual and abstract. Aria encounters no live obstacle; the spectral imaging device works without complication, and the diary entries deliver exposition on demand. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The "hint of stirring" at the end suggests thematic resolution without demonstrating a cost or trade-off that Aria paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—redirect operatives to safety via the microdot—is signaled early and coherent. Escalation is minimal: the plan unfolds as intended with no on-page tightening or reversal that forces a trade-off. The keeper's daughter carrying the microdot is orchestrated off-page. The ending delivers satisfaction without a visible price; luck and convenience dominate over protagonist cost. One meaningful pressure point (the transmission) exists but does not narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—stopping the possession before completion—is signaled early. Yet escalation is passive: the entity "recoils," "snarls," "thrashed," "faltered" in response to the priest's voice and paint, but the priest never faces a forced trade-off or narrowing of options. The "victory was fragile" is asserted without an on-page cost that alters later tactics. No reversal or tightening is driven by protagonist agency; the entity's collapse reads as coincidental surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—coaxing lost childhood melodies into audible form before exhaustion—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spire's hum deepens in response to Ai's voice, validating his method and raising the stakes from solitary ritual to genuine creation. The dawn arrival provides a ticking clock, and the final C-major chord marks successful completion. However, the price paid is asserted ("having cost him everything") without a visible forfeit that narrows his future options, and no mid-climb complication tests his commitment or forces a trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared but never tested on the page; Kael retraces, jumps, and the viaduct shifts, yet no option narrows or trade-off materializes. The story asserts escalation ("time was running out," "the labyrinth demanded a sacrifice") without showing what Kael risks or forfeits to proceed. Coincidence drives the ending: the viaduct shatters, he falls "into another timeline," and suddenly sees "the path out"—a deus ex machina that resolves without protagonist agency or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when she files the needle crude despite knowing it will tear grooves, a trade-off that raises cost. The backward recordings escalate from "low guttural frequency" to "final track's reversed crescendo" that snaps the filament, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency in the peak beat is somewhat passive (letting vibrations happen to her) rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the cost is felt but not decisively chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to trust the rogue message and act—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias opens the tube and reads the cryptic note, which narrows his options from passive inquiry to active decision. However, the escalation is more intellectual puzzle-solving than dramatized pressure; the "tail" vanishes off-page and does not return to complicate the choice. The final resolution ("he made his choice") asserts agency without showing what is foreclosed or paid; coincidence (finding the tube in the cobblestones) sets up the problem rather than protagonist action driving it.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's paradoxes—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Langdon faces no trade-off or tightening; the rope "solution" arrives without foreclosing a live option or forcing a sacrifice. The two devices present an impossible choice in summary, but Langdon's action (tying them together) bypasses tension rather than escalating it. No visible cost or deepening under any lens; the resolution is conceptual assertion without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished, unbinding the hush—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Lyra's actions accumulate (hum, play, speak) without a reversal or trade-off that narrows her options. The sapling's unfurling and the melody's travel feel like rewards granted rather than earned through agency or sacrifice. No coincidence resolves the plot, but there is also no moment where Lyra must choose between competing goods or pay a visible price to achieve her goal, leaving escalation flat under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to subsume or amplify the chemist's emotion—is signaled but arrives late (final third). The dealer's initial motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy, even if the empathy was borrowed") never faces on-page friction; the shift to amplifying occurs without visible trade-off or cost to their business model. The chemist's absence throughout the scene means all pressure is internal reflection rather than situational complication. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the dealer simply decides differently without foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early but never tightened or tested by opposition. Marla's three kind acts (locket delivery, conductor introduction, helping the composer) proceed without friction, cost, or a moment where she must choose between competing goods. The manuscript reveal is serendipitous discovery, not earned escalation. No on-page reversal narrows options or imposes a felt trade-off; pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (Kael's longing to belong) is clear, but escalation is declarative rather than earned. The incomplete tag could have forced a hard choice—complete it dishonestly, abandon the myth, or sacrifice something personal—but instead the arbor "stirs" in response to their combined creativity without narrowing options. "Maybe it's not enough" is a micro-turn instantly resolved by Elara's reframe, not a pressure point with cost. No visible price alters later tactics; the bloom is granted rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (uncage the source of echoes before the giant wakes) is signaled early and pressure tightens when the interrupted cadence begins. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than tactical: borrowing time accelerates him through the city, but we never see a failed attempt, a narrowed option, or a visible price paid mid-journey that alters his approach. The climactic choice—"severing the anchor"—is framed as a binary (uncage or leave it) without on-page friction; the cost ("shattering his existence") is declared in a subordinate clause and then bypassed by the smile at closure, undercutting the weight of the renunciation. Agency is present but the trade-off feels told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding Liora's absence. The piece tightens once through the vision sequence that shifts Elian's goal from solving her disappearance to accepting ambiguity. However, the escalation lacks concrete constraint—no failed attempt, no choice that forecloses a path before the vision arrives. The glass eyes pulse, the mosaic shifts, and the vision simply grants understanding without requiring agency or trade-off. Cost is asserted ("heavier with clarity yet lighter with peace") but not dramatized in a choice that narrows options. One deepening is present but pressure remains steady rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's desire to communicate hidden stories to the librarian—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The power outage provides a ticking clock, and his caching of the tape fragment in the hollowed book is a concrete escalation. However, the librarian's discovery unfolds exactly as Elias planned, with no reversal, complication, or visible price. He watches from safety, smiles, and plans the next act; the resolution confirms his pattern rather than testing it under pressure. Agency is present but consequence-free, preventing the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding plant behavior through a predictive model—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through failed attempts (diagrams fail, plastic shield worsens things) that narrow options until surrender becomes the only path. The storm forces a tightening: his "rigid framework begin[s] to splinter" under repeated pressure. Agency is renunciation with visible cost (drops tablet, abandons control). One meaningful deepening is present. The price—loss of his method—is legible on the page. Slightly below 8.2 threshold for high-band eligibility due to the resolution feeling more like yielding than a choice that trades competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—to understand the rain trails and convergence—is signaled early but remains abstract. The exchange with the stranger is frictionless; Elara receives the bee brooch and vortex visions without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. No on-page tightening forces a choice that forecloses a path. The "readiness to paint what she had truly seen" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her visions went silent—is signaled early but pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through agency. Elara's reaching for the pearl is the only on-page choice; the transformation then happens *to* her via "invitation" rather than through decisions that narrow options. The pilgrim's arrival and their shared stepping deeper suggest partnership but no trade-off or visible cost that differentiates the after-state from the mystical premise. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the final image recycles the initial goal without reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—compiling exile memory into collective meaning—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the fisherman's deposit, Kai's recognition, and the community's gradual contributions, but all escalation occurs in summary across the three-month ellipsis rather than on-page turns. No moment narrows Elara's tactical options with visible cost; the "staggered intervals" method is declared effective without dramatizing resistance, failure, or trade-off. The ending grants success ("she had created a space where memory could find its way home") as affirmation rather than hard-won closure shaped by protagonist agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake (find the fortress) is signaled early. Pressure is declared ("test of resolve," "price demanded") but never materialized in a trade-off or forfeiture with on-page cost. The gate opens when he presses the punch—no choice, no competing option, no visible price paid. The mirrors crack as he passes without him making a decision that forecloses a path. Under any lens, escalation is asserted ("heart racing," "trembling") rather than caused by narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the tile to ease village grief—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page escalation or tightening narrows Elara's options; the tile's revelation unfolds without obstacle, resistance, or cost. The memory cascade is a passive reception, not a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is observation without decision, and the "transformed skeptic" outcome lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what follows goodbye—is declared early but never tested by a choice that narrows options on the page. The protagonist's agency is passive observation and a single deliberate press of the amulet into a hollow; no prior reversal or cost shapes this final act. The storm and magnetic fields escalate in description but do not force a tactical shift or impose a visible price. The closure reads as an automatic unmaking triggered by placing the fragment, not a decision with felt sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: get Elena out before her pursuers realize she's alive. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guard approaches and Maya must execute the ink-symbol trick within the ninety-second window. Agency is present (Maya's plan, her activation of the ink), and the escape succeeds on-page. The cost, however, is back-loaded to the ink pot handoff rather than embedded in the breach itself—no visible trade-off during the guard manipulation (no stamina drain, no risk of touching the ink, no narrow miss). The phrase "mathematics of fairness" is told as motive but never tested by competing pressures or a forced choice between goods.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving temporal textures against erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the ritual-to-embedding sequence, but no reversal or tightening narrows options or raises cost on the page; Silas completes twelve cards without friction, loss, or visible trade-off. The ending reweights his work thematically ("small windows into times… lost forever") yet the reweighting is conceptual rather than borne of a dramatized choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification would suffice, but the cadence remains steady rather than shifting with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (forge identity from fragments) is signaled early but never escalates through on-page resistance or cost. The label discovery at midpoint offers a potential tightening, yet the protagonist's layering proceeds without friction—no fragment contradicts another, no stevedore objects, no inner doubt forces a tradeoff. The ending ("a key, a proof of existence") declares success without showing what path was foreclosed or what tactic changed. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient, but here pressure remains flat from first mention to pocket-slip.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding why consciousness exists—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the compass points inward, forcing Elias to reframe his approach. However, the escalation lacks concrete cost: Elias tries the cello method and immediately succeeds in gaining new insight without genuine resistance or trade-off. The conference memory reveals that others feared his idea rather than mocked it, but this realization doesn't narrow his options or force a sacrifice. The resolution feels more like intellectual adjustment than a choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (preserve carnival culture against privatization) is signaled early. The graffiti network constitutes a tightening move, and the solstice performance represents escalation. Yet the key reversal—developers' shift to "unexpected openness"—occurs off-page and is summarized, not dramatized, undercutting agency and visible cost. The protagonist's endurance and coordination efforts matter, but the final negotiation beat lacks on-page friction or a trade-off that forecloses a live option with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (photograph the final occurrence) is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure is static: Elias climbs, sets up, waits, succeeds. The radiation warnings and corporate threat are told as background rather than dramatized obstacles that force tactical shifts. No meaningful on-page tightening or reversal narrows options; the chemical process activates as planned with no complication. The resolution grants success without visible cost—"exceeded his expectations"—undermining escalation under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring the drone's guidance before the ship departs—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias discovers the backup flaw via refraction. Yet the ship's deadline imposes no visible cost or tactic change; Elias finishes calmly, the drone lifts off, and no trade-off or foreclosed path is legible on the page. The repair unfolds as a sequence of solved micro-problems without escalating pressure or a final choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to chart the hidden convergence points where rivers begin. The condensation patterns provide one meaningful deepening—Elias moves from noticing anomalies to understanding their hydrological principle—but no external opposition or internal conflict tests his commitment. The resolution is knowledge-gain and a stated intention to depart; we do not witness a choice that forecloses an alternate path with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens, the reweighting is legible but gentle; the story lacks a tightening that narrows options or a dramatized price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town—is signaled early and accumulates through layered sensory beats (cobblestones pulse, door opens, laughter echoes, chimney smokes). But there is no on-page tightening or reversal: the tuner faces no obstacle, makes no forced choice, pays no visible cost. Each step succeeds without friction; the archway responds, the tower aligns, the house becomes whole. Agency is absent—he performs a ritual that cannot fail, and "his role done" asserts completion without dramatized consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (find mentor / understand temple / "harness ephemeral energies") shifts across the text without convergence. Declared pressures—"time runs short," "oxygen reserves dwindle," "water begins to breach"—are announced but never force Marina to abandon an attempt, choose between tools, or pay a visible price. The sequence "unsnarl temporal threads → integrate with temple" reads as outline fulfillment rather than protagonist-driven escalation; no live option is foreclosed on the page. No reversal or deepening tightens her choices; she proceeds from signal to chamber to integration without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (escape before discovery) is signaled early and sustains pressure through the copper-to-purple sunset clock. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wall yields and the warden's footsteps approach, narrowing the window. However, the escape itself unfolds without friction or tactical cost—Elias performs the ritual flawlessly and emerges unimpeded. The discovery of bodies and vindication are narrated as future certainty, not on-page consequence, softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is signaled early but never tested by on-page choice or trade-off. Escalation proceeds through summary and passive magic (the bead "wove threads," "flared," memories "surfaced unbidden") rather than protagonist agency. The botanist's "understanding" arrives via epiphany, not a narrowing of options or a decision under competing pressure. The ghost's "approach" unfolds through atmospheric touches (scent, cold kiss, whisper) but no reversal forces her to alter tactics or pay a visible cost before she dissolves. The ending recycles the same glowing-orchard imagery without deepening or tightening the central pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: transforming ruin into beauty (signaled midpoint, not early). Pressure accumulates through atmospheric deepening rather than causal escalation; the sleepwalking, empty tides, and labyrinth discovery layer texture but don't narrow Elara's options or force a trade-off. The weaving act at closure is a decisive moment, yet no live alternative is foreclosed on the page—she simply executes her craft without visible cost or competing desire. The piece reads as situational-textural hybrid, but the final image charges meaning without showing what was surrendered (time, stamina, connection to the wharf) to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore lineage faith through physical reunion of the sundial base—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The excavation tightens pressure once: discovery of the circular hollow narrows options to a single, fitting act. The placement itself (sundial into socket) forecloses diaspora as permanent rupture, which is a visible cost to her prior identity abroad. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices. However, agency leans passive (laborers dig, Elara observes and places); the tomb "reveals" rather than Elara forcing discovery through tactical choice under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    The declared stake—"discover meaning in the margins" before mailing a letter—never faces on-page pressure or a test that could fail. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elliot completes his ritual as planned with no friction, obstacle, or trade-off. The piece presents a want without a need, and the resolution is pre-ordained repetition rather than earned by protagonist agency. Cost is absent; "careful invention" is completed "until the next morning" with no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering conspiracies before the coup—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias simply stitches faster and "the conspiracies unraveled...with the quiet precision of his needle" in summary. The coup is "postponed by a thread" without agency, mechanism, or visible cost. No escalation is dramatized; pressure is asserted ("time was running out") but not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.6)
    No escalation under any lens: the medium enters, the shard responds, words appear, closure arrives—each step facilitated rather than resisted. The dominant stake (evoking an unspoken apology) is declared but never tested; no decision point asks what she will sacrifice or risk. The "unsent letters" belong to an absent lover, so the protagonist has no agency in their resolution. Coincidence provides: the spirits guide, the moonlight pierces at the needed moment, the shard fulfills its purpose without cost to her.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking solace from the weight of his work—is signaled early and modulates through the encounter with the girl. One meaningful tightening occurs when he begins decrypting the cast notes, narrowing focus from passive observation to active engagement, and the pattern recognition ("'Empty' isn't a word...it's a direction") reweights his understanding. However, the girl's disappearance removes the test of whether this new meaning can withstand continued pressure, and the final cost (returning pain, memory of the cast) is more reflective than a trade-off that forecloses a live tactical path. Agency is present but diluted by the girl's convenient exit and the closure's reliance on internal reframing over choice under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (rediscover lost joy) is signaled early, and the light-ritual beat constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is absent—Elara's process unfolds without complication, reversal, or visible cost. The waning energy is mentioned ("her energy waned") but does not force a trade-off or foreclose a path. The resolution is a successful display followed by a satisfied exit; no price alters later tactics or charges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is declared by the nickel-man rather than tested through protagonist agency under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the garden sequence presents conceptual awakenings in sequence without escalation, and Elara's return to the chapel involves no trade-off or visible cost. Coincidence (the nickel's warmth, the shimmer) triggers the transition rather than a decision that narrows options. The piece accumulates texture and reweights perception, but under the Accumulative lens escalation still requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that forecloses a path—here, the final image simply asserts "new curiosity" without demonstrating what she has renounced or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve defiant thought/language) is signaled early and sustained. The raid announcement at the greenhouse is a meaningful reversal, but Silas's "double down" response faces no on-page cost—he plants, the Enforcers miss the wildflower, he smiles. The escalation from secret club to public garden to raid is coherent under a Situational lens, yet the final beat resolves through luck (they missed it) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is present (he refuses to remove messages) but the wildflower's bloom is coincidental, not protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The poet's insomnia and centuries of longing are told rather than dramatized through a meaningful tightening; no on-page reversal narrows options. The blossom's arrival is coincidence (it floats above the waves, unprompted), and its resolution of the poet's suffering lacks agency: he reaches, pain dissolves, armistice achieved. No visible price is paid; the ending offers continuation ("the next chapter is yours") rather than a trade-off or foreclosed path. Pressure remains static across the narrative, with no escalation under the Accumulative lens that would reweight the stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve forgotten names and keep the library intact—is signaled early and remains consistent. The cracked chime creates one problem-solution loop, then the locket creates a second with slightly higher personal cost (memory vs. voice), but this is repetition rather than escalation; the second act does not raise the stakes or narrow options beyond the first. Agency is present (the caretaker chooses to act) but the resolution is assured by the method itself—humming always works—so no genuine trade-off or live risk pressures the choice. The final image reframes endurance ("how long could one person hold...?") without foreclosing a path or paying a price that changes future capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust before paths diverge—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is absent: each promise flows smoothly without complication, setback, or forced trade-off. The ink well's shattering might function as cost, but the text immediately tells us "the symphonies of truth didn't break—they swelled," neutralizing any loss. No on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; the method works on first attempt and "he" arrives as reward rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—balancing the town's water need against his mother's plea for restraint—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal tests his commitment; the analyzer simply delivers the answer. The final "decision" to recalibrate is summarized without showing what he forgoes, what resource he spends, or what relationship he risks. Coincidence (the chain's length matching floodgate capacity, the worn link at midpoint) provides the solution rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the sister's lullaby through an impossible ritual—is signaled early and tightens when Elian attaches the meteorite to the pigeon, a delicate operation with visible bodily cost ("hands that trembled only slightly"). The bird's launch is an act of renunciation (releasing control) and endurance (trusting his method despite fragility), foreclosing the path of paralyzed possession. The escalation is a single deepening appropriate to the Accumulative lens, and the cost (sending the fragment away, accepting incompleteness) is legible on the page in the image of the receding speck.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (why thresholds feel sacred) is signaled early but never escalates through reversal or tightening. Elea encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and pays no price; she simply arrives at understanding. The logbook, wood grain, and father's voice offer clues but do not resist or complicate her path. The ending delivers philosophical acceptance without narrowing options or foreclosing a live alternative with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding belonging—is signaled early but remains abstract. The discovery unfolds without opposition or trade-off; Elara activates the system at 3:17 AM with no price, no competing option, no resource constraint. The plankton display at 4:52 AM is a gift, not an earned reversal. Kaelen's arrival adds no friction. The final paragraph's assertion ("belonging wasn't discovered but created") is thematic summary, not a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—why some paths disappear—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure is declared ("running out of time before memory faded") but the ticking clock does not force a trade-off or narrow options on the page; daylight shifts from morning to afternoon without urgency altering her method. The reversal (empty circles revealing deliberate removal) arrives through observation rather than protagonist agency under duress. No live choice forecloses a path; the discovery raises "more questions than it solved," which undercuts escalation. One meaningful deepening occurs (color meanings → empty voids → pattern), but cost remains abstract and future-facing ("until next season") rather than paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—executing orchestrated serendipity—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One tightening occurs: bishop placement → note → clock sequence narrows the path toward midnight. However, escalation lacks genuine opposition; every element (juggler's dropped pins, violinist's music, woman's arrival and key) aligns perfectly with Elias's plan without friction or cost. The resolution is pre-arranged collaboration rather than protagonist agency under duress, and no visible trade-off or foreclosed option charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—completing her purpose to transcend the Nostalgia Ban through embodied verse—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Lyra progresses through seventeen sacred forms without friction, and the "spontaneously anchored" magic releases her automatically upon completion. The transformation is convenience rather than earned escalation. Agency is absent: Lyra performs choreographed steps, and the result is granted rather than chosen with visible cost (−0.8 for no escalation under the lens).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—illuminating value in the mundane—is signaled early but never pressured. The protagonist's communion with the bay proceeds without opposition, reversal, or tightening; each ripple delivers an insight on cue. No live option is foreclosed, no cost is paid. The storm "brewing offshore" is noted but does not complicate his action. The piece accumulates observations in a flat sequence (and-then) rather than escalating under any lens—causal linkage, accumulative density shift, or situational crystallization are all absent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: Elias confronting trauma to find healing. The reflective walk provides a single deepening (opening the box, lifting the bell, realizing the box's dual purpose), but no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The therapist's suggestion frames the journey, yet Elias faces no live resistance or trade-off in the present scene. The "bargain" and its resolution are recounted, not tested; closure lands as epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—"to puzzle out new equations for hope"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a narrowing choice. The gauge's movements and the water's glow feel like atmospheric responses rather than escalation that forces trade-offs. No reversal or tightening occurs; she arranges, adjusts, observes, and succeeds without visible cost or a moment where prior tactics fail and force adaptation. The "trial" proceeds smoothly to affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake ("discover what walls dream about") is signaled early but remains abstract. The only on-page reversal is the wall glimpse of the woman's face, which Elian passively receives rather than pursues through agency. No decision forecloses an option or incurs a trade-off; he pockets the negative, sees a vision, and walks away resolved to return. Pressure does not tighten—each beat accumulates mood without narrowing tactics or raising cost. The ending resets rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the mirage painting before the bells shatter the hush—is signaled early and provides a time-bound pressure. The borrowed heartbeat accelerates slightly as the work nears completion, offering a micro-turn. However, the stakes remain largely procedural; no live option is foreclosed, and the painter's tactics do not visibly narrow under the pressure. The cost is conceptual (ephemeral art, secrecy) rather than dramatized through a trade-off or forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking redemption by honoring the dead—is clear and held throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs: the ritual transforms his self-concept from negotiator to memory-keeper. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no live reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options under pressure. Agency is present (choosing to read each name), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral—no visible price paid that forecloses a concrete path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the extinct bird's echo. However, there is no meaningful tightening or escalation—Silas encounters no opposition, resource pressure, or decision fork. The release sequence proceeds as planned with the device whirring and the egg converting; no on-page reversal tests his commitment. The "either return...or shatter it forever" presents stakes in summary but the dramatized action carries no felt risk. Agency is reduced to button-pressing; coincidence (rain arriving "at last") completes the scene rather than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—escaping conformity's lullaby—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page opponent or cost. The untangling sequence offers three threads with escalating difficulty, yet none forces a trade-off: each dissolves into starlight without visible loss. The "final thread" that "snapped" could have been the moment of agency, but her choice is foregone; no option is foreclosed. Pressure remains conceptual rather than embodied, and coincidence (the threads simply yield) resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"ethical storytelling"—is declared in dialogue but never tested on-page through a choice with competing costs. Elias's puppet shows are summarized across weeks without a single dramatized beat where an audience member's reaction forces him to adapt tactics or pay a price. The "aggressive critic" arrives late and is dismissed with a smile and quip, deflating rather than escalating pressure. The final performance's "cut strings" gesture lacks causal grounding: no prior scene showed Elias struggling to release control, so the act carries no felt cost or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (building a signal to honor the last monarchs) is clear and pursued throughout, but escalation is absent: Elias encounters no obstacle, hesitation, or competing pressure. The fallen monarch is incorporated "simply," without dramatized cost or friction. No reversal or deepening occurs; the structure is completed as intended, and Elias walks away as planned. The ending asserts conceptual weight ("more than enough"), but without an on-page tightening or choice that narrows options, the stake remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and coherent. One tightening occurs when the caster unravels the knots, but the rope's response is immediate cooperation rather than resistance. No visible cost: the voices rise "in gratitude," and the caster's hands are "steady" at closure. Agency reads as ritual execution without a forfeited path or trade-off that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the directive's conceptual rot—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes "repair was futile" and must "transcend" through his unique perception. The escalation is causal (wafer seal decay → plunge into dreamscape → code restoration), and Kael's agency drives the turn ("he offered his own mind"). However, the intervention itself unfolds without setback or cost: he "gently guided" corrupted code back to purity and the seal "healed" in a single uninterrupted sequence. The lack of intermediate resistance or visible forfeit (stamina, risk of entrapment, a fragment of self left behind) keeps the cost abstract and undercuts the tightening that would enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—sealing the covenant with the unknown before the new regime's inspectors arrive—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful tightening (the celestial alignment occurs, the tile glows, Elias presses his palm), consistent with Accumulative escalation via density and cadence shift. However, no live option is foreclosed and no visible trade-off surfaces; Elias achieves his goal without friction, loss, or adaptation. The inspectors' drums beat in the distance but never arrive to test his resolve, leaving the declared urgency unfulfilled on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching resentment to release—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Six identical sequences (extend box, brief resistance, three notes, tears, departure) produce no reversal, cost, or narrowing of options. Elias faces no opposition, makes no trade-off, and experiences no failure or adaptation. The claim that "scheming had become genuine compassion" is told rather than earned through a dramatized turn. No agency or consequence is legible on the page; the story ends where it began.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (capture the runaway dream) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirror shards merge and the dream-bird appears, but the tightening lacks agency—the bird chooses to return rather than Elian forcing a confrontation or trade-off. The ritual proceeds without visible setback or adjustment, reading procedural. The ending reconfigures the goal (home rather than trap) but the shift arrives without dramatized cost or friction that would make the "invitation" method hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: mend the breach with her daughter. The mender's planting ritual provides one meaningful deepening (symbols become bridge-promise), and her persistence is clear. However, no live reversal or tightening forecloses an option—she faces no opposition, and the seed's acceptance ("trembled, a pulse of life") arrives without cost or tradeoff. Agency reads as endurance rather than a choice that narrows paths. The breach and daughter's departure are recounted, not dramatized, so escalation remains reflective rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cameo and orchard—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or tightening that narrows options. Margaret's visits accumulate without escalation; each revelation ("the orchard existed between the first and last page") is told rather than earned through a choice under pressure. The decision to find a successor and leave the cameo occurs off-stage, removing agency from the closure beat. No live price on the page forecloses a path or alters her state with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Elara's need to find Kael, signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure tightens when she realizes she must prove the library's logical existence rather than physically search for it. The reversal—diary as *from* the library, not a guide *to* it—is earned and narrows her options. Agency is clear: she renegotiates the mountain's nature by cataloguing voids, a choice that forecloses wandering and opens the path. The cost at closure (the "quiet hum of potential forever imprinted") is felt but somewhat oblique; a more concrete visible price (e.g., a renunciation, a visible change in capability, or a relationaldamage) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (find the garden of forgotten names) is declared early but never tested by a visible tradeoff. The ship's fog "fights back" in one beat, but the twin tears free with a convenient "surge of strength" rather than through a costly tactical choice. No meaningful tightening occurs; obstacles dissolve on cue. The narrative threads are "recaptured" without showing what must be sacrificed or what option is foreclosed. Under any lens, escalation is absent and agency remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost stories/translating absence into truth—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Elias steps through the void and must solve the rope configuration, narrowing his options to one action. Yet the escalation is spatial (door opens, platform appears, rope puzzle) rather than driven by competing costs or protagonist error. The final act succeeds without visible sacrifice or a path foreclosed, and no secondary pressure (time limit, danger, rival claim) tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—conjuring the bloom of hush to restore silence—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lorne finds "the moment of convergence" and the stone flares, narrowing his options to this exact configuration. Yet the escalation is smooth rather than pressurized: no failed attempt, no cost paid to succeed, no live consequence if he delays. The bloom's arrival feels like wish-fulfillment rather than a trade-off, and the "reprieve" framing tells us it's temporary without showing what Lorne surrenders or risks to achieve it now. Agency is present but consequence is deferred, weakening the stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rekindle the beacon to prove coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Kaelen's three years of observation and the alignment sequence, but the climax unfolds as a successful execution without a live obstacle or forced trade-off. The shard of hush solves the technical problem without prior complication; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option or extracts visible cost. The distant settlements' reception is told, not shown, and the protagonist's agency at closure is observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or loss. Kael measures, conjectures, writes; no reversal or tightening narrows his options. The fog lifts as external event, not protagonist-driven escalation. The ending claims completion ("he had succeeded") without demonstrating a trade-off or visible cost that altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early but remains abstract. The tightening occurs when Marlo lights the knot and spins it to reveal the full mosaic message, yet this action feels like puzzle-solving rather than a choice that narrows options or risks cost. No live option is foreclosed; Marlo encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and faces no consequence beyond gaining insight. The story offers one meaningful deepening (mosaic fragments → complete truth) under an accumulative lens, but the resolution is delivered rather than earned through protagonist agency with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—navigating the difficult conversation through understanding transition—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian's reflection on the cicada's survival reframes Mara's unspoken words, enabling the conversation to find its cadence. Agency operates through attention and articulated understanding rather than decisive external action, which fits the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt (something ending) but remains somewhat abstract; a more specific forfeiture or visible price at the final beat would strengthen escalation. Mara's "softening like sand" provides a micro-turn that sets up closure without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.7)
    One dominant stake—collecting silence flavors—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens. Elara prepares, ascends, sifts silences, and returns in a smooth arc with no reversal, complication, or visible cost. The "sudden lurch" of gravity's return is described as disruptive ("gilded hush fractured into shards") yet she has already succeeded, and no live option is foreclosed. Agency is passive observation; she absorbs experiences without a decision that narrows her path. The story reads as a mystical travelogue rather than a conflict under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake ("to teach silence how to comfort") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful complication occurs; Elara executes a procedure and succeeds without friction. The train whistle's echo is mentioned but never creates a live problem that forces a trade-off. Agency is procedural observation rather than decision under pressure, and the resolution arrives through summary assertion with no visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the fragment before sunrise—is declared but never tested with genuine pressure. No escalation occurs; Elias succeeds at each step without adaptation or trade-off. The guards, the waterfall, and the paint layers present no meaningful resistance. The ending shifts to distant summary spanning "decades," abandoning the sunrise deadline entirely and offering no on-page cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's sanctuary collapsing under the encroaching presence—is signaled early, but escalation occurs off-page: "the fading threshold weakened day by day" and "the barrier…was thinning" are summary without visible steps. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the encroaching presence arrives as a given, not as a consequence of her dramatized actions. The final decision to reconnect is described rather than shown through hesitation, failed alternatives, or visible trade-offs. Agency reads as conceptual rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (translating pressure into diamonds) is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Leo faces no opposition, failed attempt, or trade-off; the process succeeds instantly upon first try. The texts warned "this would happen," preempting surprise or complication. No reversal or deepening narrows options—Mara applauds, the mushrooms dim, Leo leaves. The stated cost (years of debt and regret) is historical; no present path is foreclosed or live option sacrificed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias discovers ancestors erased music to "replace it with lies," narrowing his understanding and reweighting his purpose. However, the escalation is conveyed through summary ("his mind filled with images") rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a live option. The resolution ("the bridge of intuition was their only escape") reads as insight rather than decision with visible cost, keeping pressure abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to capture the shape of possibility"—is declared but never tested on the page by a choice with alternatives and price. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the knight walks forward, finds the gear, removes it, and succeeds without friction. The marionette program "guides him" via passive pull rather than forcing a decision between competing goods. Escalation is asserted ("reality shifted," "time stretching") but not dramatized through agency or cost that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses in forgotten records—is signaled early and drives each beat: finding the button, tracing Micah's file, pairing the drawing. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias decides not to return the button, foreclosing the default archival path with visible cost (the ledger loses its artifact, the drawing gains a companion). Agency is clear (decision to pair objects), and the cost is legible (he alters the archive's order). Escalation is modest but sufficient under the Accumulative lens; no major reversals are required, and the final act reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving truth against revised history—is signaled early. The missed check-ins by Jenna establish complication, and the broadcast represents one meaningful tightening: Maya executes the contingency plan to reveal Marcus's erased existence. Yet the escalation lacks on-page resistance; the broadcast plays for ninety seconds and is shut down off-stage, with no tactical adjustment or visible price paid in the moment. The alarms sound after Maya has already "slipped out," deferring consequence beyond the narrative window. Agency is present (Maya activates the program) but the choice does not foreclose a live option with felt cost—she enacts a pre-scripted contingency without dramatized internal conflict or external friction that would narrow her moves.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—disrupt the final prophesied note—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure is situational (the critical morning, the final note "due to manifest today") and the ritual escalates toward the climax. However, the resolution is told in summary ("He felt the shift… Success") rather than shown through a concrete reversal or choice that narrows options with visible cost. The piece offers one tightening (the critical morning) but no on-page moment where Elias's agency alters tactics or forecloses a live option; his technique is described as already developed, and the climax unfolds passively. The cost remains abstract—he carries a "silent burden"—without a concrete on-page price paid at closure. For situational escalation, the stance crystallization needed to charge the ending is asserted, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the moonstone dust to reclaim lost memories—is declared early but never tested. Elias does not choose between competing goods or pay a tactical price; the Three Moon alignment hands him the answer without agency. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the speck unfolds, reveals, and transforms while Elias watches. The escalation is entirely external convenience, and the resolution ("he would prod new dust specks") promises future action rather than closing a live conflict. Pressure is static reportage rather than a tightening spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace uncertainty or continue seeking order—is signaled early but remains abstract across beats. The descent through the trapdoor and discovery of the whole clock offer one meaningful tightening (the tinkerer sees a completed version of his project), but the resolution hinges on passive realization rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. He "doesn't need to fix them anymore" and decides to follow the compass, yet no on-page consequence shows what he risks or loses—his workshop, his livelihood, his identity as a tinkerer—by abandoning his craft. The waterfall and clock are props that deliver insight rather than forces that escalate pressure or demand a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—redeeming himself by understanding the weight of names and their fractured bond—is signaled early and tightens once: Elian moves from passive reflection to active kintsugi repair, narrowing his options (he accepts Lyra's potential absence and commits to moving forward). The repair forecloses the path of seeking restoration to "before." Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens through recurring images (scales, coin, rain) and the bellows-work is protagonist-driven. Minor slip: the stakes remain largely internal and philosophical; no external antagonist or secondary pressure tests his resolve, and the coincidental steam-silhouette of Lyra feels like a gifted moment rather than one he earned through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—integrating laughter into healing—is signaled early but never tested. Both spectral encounters resolve in identical fashion: collector plays, confession emerges, laughter surfaces, spirit dissolves. No reversal, complication, or escalation appears; the second soul does not resist more strongly or require a new tactic. The protagonist's agency is limited to repetition of a method that succeeds without friction. No visible price is paid; the tooth is left behind as a thematic gesture rather than a forfeited resource that alters future capability.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discover the mathematics of mercy) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through sensory overload and trauma flashback, tightening when Kael's body replicates the mask constraint at peak intensity. The closure reweights his stance from passive survivor to active pioneer, with the forest becoming "the first variable in his proof." Cost is visible (he remains disoriented, "an outsider in his own skin") and the final step forward forecloses passive endurance. No antagonist or reversal, but the Accumulative lens allows deepening alone; escalation is driven by protagonist agency (bracing against memory) with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (uncover the lineage of translators), but pressure accumulates through revelation rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The protagonist faces no meaningful resistance, and the market merchant immediately confirms her identity and hands over the needed canvases. The final "work just beginning" gesture implies future conflict but offers no on-page cost or foreclosed path. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt consequence; here the discovery beats feel cumulative but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and drives each beat: observation → ghost vision → retrieval → resolution. The ghost vision constitutes one meaningful deepening, narrowing his search from pattern analysis to a specific object with emotional weight. The protagonist's agency is clear (he chooses to climb, to work the lath, to pocket the barrel), and the cost is visible: he carries the barrel away, a "cold, dense weight" that replaces the intangible burden he arrived with.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping eternity's suffocating grasp—is signaled early via the frost message and Elias's motivation. Pressure accumulates through whispers, the bottled fragment discovery, and the frost warning ("rupture comes with the next press"). The lever-pull is a clear tightening choice. However, the consequences (fractal dissolution, then smooth glass and clean hands) feel more like cosmic special effects than a trade-off that narrows his options or imposes a felt price before the leap.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: how to understand the vase shard's truth against institutional pressure. The night ritual provides one meaningful tightening—covering mirrors, opening the shutter—that narrows options from academic debate to private vision. Kaelen's agency is renunciation (smuggling the shard, refusing to present findings), which forecloses the path of official validation with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the light-congealing sequence to the hand-with-flower image. Escalation is modest but present; the meteor storm and ritual create urgency. Weakness: the curators' pressure remains mostly asserted backdrop rather than on-page friction that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim light stolen by midnight) is declared early but faces no on-page opposition or tightening choice. The repair unfolds as predetermined success; coincidence (the stone arrived during an eclipse) solves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid; the protagonist's agency is execution of known skill rather than a decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding "where explanations fail"—is signaled early and drives all moves. The compass discovery tightens options (it "homing" rather than broken), psychometry narrows the search to limestone cliffs, and the descent escalates physically and emotionally. The lagoon revelation deepens the stake conceptually: Elias discovers not answers but a beautiful erasure of explanation. Closure trades pursuit for acceptance, foreclosing his collector identity with visible cost. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to leave the compass and climb back transformed. One friction: the explorers' dissolution is told through vision rather than on-page encounter, which slightly mutes the peak turn's immediacy and reduces the felt price of Elias's decision to leave.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (decoding the slide's purpose) is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. Each sculpture reveals the next object in a treasure-hunt sequence without cost, complication, or narrowing options. The storm's cessation is convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. No live trade-off or renunciation forecloses a path; the ending declares stakes met ("alliances complete") without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity; Lena's research proceeds without meaningful obstacle or trade-off until the glass reveals the answer. No reversal or deepening narrows her options; the story is a straight accumulation of clues culminating in delivered exposition. The final "realization" (night blooms serve nocturnal pollinators) does not emerge from protagonist agency or a difficult choice but from passive discovery. No visible price is paid; her obsession simply "softened into contentment" off-page, and visitors' reactions do not dramatize consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the lagoon's truth—is signaled early and pursued through arranging messages. The shape's reply "THEY BURY US" and Elias's "WHY?" constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows options. However, escalation depends heavily on the diary's convenient "click" and the shape's appearance rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The final "REMEMBER" message carries conceptual cost (Elias bound as translator, pull weakened but "never over"), but the price feels more thematic assertion than a visible trade-off that forecloses a live path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reimagining a civilization—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure nominally tightens when the lanterns dim during Elian's hesitation, but the resolution is immediate and costless: he "tightens his grip" and "chose balance," and the town responds. No live option is foreclosed; no visible price paid. The story gestures at escalation (the bottle "demanded more") but delivers summary rather than a choice under duress. Agency is present but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the prophecy warning—is signaled clearly. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on a single intensification: the wax shaving's revelation. Elias's choice to "immerse himself fully" arrives without visible tradeoff or tactical narrowing; he closes his eyes and accepts. The foghorn's silence bookends the piece but doesn't tighten decisions. One meaningful deepening occurs (understanding the archives as "growing entities"), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—recalibrating the vortex inheritance—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: the protagonist kneels, performs gestures, and steps through without a live complication or reversal that narrows options. The "method" (decreasing entropy) is narrated as successful execution rather than a tactic tested under resistance. Agency is present (she chooses to step through) but the choice costs nothing on the page; the transformation from "frantic" to "serene" is told in summary. No escalation or deepening alters tactics; coincidence (the cap fits perfectly) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—ensuring warning systems function for the communities below—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page failure or human consequence dramatizes urgency. The test sequence unfolds without opposition or complication. Elian's "switch" to the bell is presented as planned redundancy, not a forced trade-off. The approaching storm is noted but does not arrive to test his work on the page. No visible price is paid; the closure declares preparedness without demonstrating cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—finding strength through vulnerability—is declared thematically but never tested on-page through a concrete choice with alternatives. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara's decades of meditation are summarized without escalation. The "moment of profound clarity" arrives via summary rather than protagonist decision, and the resolution ("established a new rhythm") has no visible cost or foreclosed path. Pressure remains flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the covenant amid fracturing unity—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the box's color shift reveals discord, and Elisha's ritual reknits the agreement, resulting in acceptance by the ghosts and arrival of three new spirits. This is a single meaningful deepening under an Accumulative/Textural lens, sufficient at this length. However, agency is diffuse; the ghosts choose unity, and the bees and box participate, while Elisha's role is interpretive mediation without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The cost—his continued solitude, perhaps—is thematic rather than on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake (reconstruct the time capsule) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Elias finds the coordinates and descends, but this move is prompted by luck (finding the music-box listing) rather than protagonist trade-off. The journal's revelations arrive without prior obstacle or cost; Elias never sacrifices time, conceals the find from others, or faces a competing claim. No live option is foreclosed; the ending comfort replaces fear without visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The kite-string catch and weaving offer one tightening moment, but no meaningful reversal or deepening narrows options with visible cost. The poet's final decision (to walk away and let the tide claim the sculpture) is told as inevitable philosophy rather than dramatized as a trade-off with felt consequences. Under the Accumulative lens, no cadence shift or density increase forces a stance crystallization; pressure plateaus after the weaving and the ending summarizes rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake: unlock architectural secrets and foster interspecies respect before death. The six-month clock is declared but never tightened on the page—"three months into his sentence" and "final days" are told markers without rising cost or tactical shifts. No on-page reversal or choice narrows options; the wire network grows smoothly, visitors sense change, and Kaelen dies satisfied. The ending offers thematic repricing (relationships over designs) but no dramatized escalation or visible tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening turn is required; here, progression is additive without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the pilgrimage's purpose—is signaled early and Aris's ascent tightens focus toward the pedestal. The placement of the amber constitutes an on-page choice that reweights his stance. However, escalation is thin: the climb itself imposes no tactical dilemma, and the decision to place the amber arrives without visible friction or trade-off. The "weight of the pilgrimage" and subsequent "doubt crack" are told rather than tested, and no live cost (relational, physical, or opportunity) materializes to substantiate the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (ecological-spiritual restoration) is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs—the coachman performs his ritual without opposition, adaptation, or visible trade-off. Escalation reads as ceremonial description rather than pressure that narrows options. The "work" is completed off-page during the vigil; the seeds' sprouting is told consequence, not dramatized cost. No agency-driven turn that forecloses a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding his sister—is signaled early. However, no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; each step (find cylinder, read it, heat leaf, get next clue) succeeds without complication or trade-off. No reversal, no failure, no forced choice between competing goods. The ending promise ("perhaps she herself would be waiting") lacks on-page pressure; coincidence (finding the right cylinder, having the right leaf) drives progress rather than protagonist agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: turn confusion into exploration. The story delivers one meaningful tightening—Elias's glimpse of the shimmer deepens into the ghost-sky overlay, forcing the realization that "true north" is relative stability between temporal bubbles. This insight forecloses passive mourning and reconfigures his family custom into active cartography. Agency is decision and endurance: he chooses to sketch the phantom stars rather than only the familiar sky, and his status as "blessed pariah" becomes a lens. The cost is legible: his suffering is instrumentalized, his isolation persists, but now with direction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—amending the Architect's cruel plans—is signaled early but never tightens into a concrete dilemma. The chess exchange proceeds smoothly without reversals; each piece swaps as ritual, not escalating risk. The Architect's "you win" concession arrives without visible cost to either party. Agency exists in Kaelen's choice to leave the sundial, but this renunciation feels thematic rather than pressure-driven, lacking the foreclosed path or trade-off required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to document unrecorded gestures—is signaled early but never tested. Elara walks, traces words, remembers, and departs; no reversal or tightening narrows her options or raises cost. The interregnum is declared but imposes no clock or urgency. Her "unbinding" of trauma from performance is asserted in reflection, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Without agency under pressure, escalation cannot occur.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding/recreating "home"—is declared but never tested on the page; no competing option or obstacle forces a trade-off. Each discovery (stone, language, feather conduit, seeding ability) arrives as a gift rather than through agency-driven pursuit. The "hidden thunder" grows "stronger" in summary without a single beat where escalating power costs her something tangible or forecloses an alternate path. The ending is pure potential ("might not need to return") with no on-page price paid or decision crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness through labyrinth mastery—is clear from the outset. Pressure escalates as he decodes threads, navigates platforms, and confronts the stalemate that caused his exile. The agency is genuine: his mind must find the elegant sacrifice he once missed. The cost is legible (guilt winnowed, years of exile ended), though the labyrinth's challenges feel more described than dramatized with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—understand what the ritual contains—and pressure accumulates as poetry sessions intensify and the canyon answers. However, escalation is delivered mostly through exposition ("his sessions grew longer, his verses more desperate") rather than on-page tightening. The canyon's voice arriving "three nights before the ritual" tells rather than dramatizes the turn. The final act (spire crumbling) asserts a decisive change without showing the choice mechanism or immediate cost that would make the trade-off legible; consequences are promised but deferred off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (restore the statue by narrating its history) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The wave submersion offers a potential reversal but is narratively bypassed—he narrates "through memory alone" and the workshop simply "righted itself" with no adaptation or cost. The final pockmark is reached on schedule, not through earned struggle. Agency at closure is present (he completes the restoration) but the transformation happens *to* the statue rather than requiring a difficult choice from the protagonist. The ending asserts meaning conjured from oblivion without dramatizing what was risked or lost to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a promise to find something unbreakable—is signaled through backstory but not tested by external pressure or a tightening choice until the cave sequence. The shell's release narrows options (he lets go of preservation), but the act feels self-directed rather than forced by escalating conflict. No antagonist or opposition complicates the painter's path; coincidence (the wrong turn) enables rather than complicates resolution. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than causal escalation, and the final act does alter the protagonist's stance, but cost remains abstract ("lighter than they'd been in years") without a visible forfeiture or tradeoff that charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and sustained through the ascent. Pressure accumulates via the scent's impossible bloom and the final beckoning wind, creating one meaningful tightening. Yet the cork's departure encounters no on-page resistance or tradeoff; the "invitation, unburdening of sorrow" remains abstract, and we do not see what live option Elias forecloses or what price he pays for the release. The accumulative lens allows this to function, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—navigating loss through ritual—is signaled early and accumulates through the map-building sequence. One tightening occurs when the navigator stops answering the phone, but this forecloses no live option with visible cost; the phone was already ignored. The censer foot's cooling marks completion, yet no trade-off or tension resolves on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight via a pattern break or cadence shift that narrows options; here the final walk is asserted without prior friction, yielding mid-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (psychological privacy from empathy virus exposure) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates: isolation → foraging → relic in pocket → stranger approaches and Elara's thoughts broadcast → storm returns, forcing the decision. The activation is protagonist-driven and narrows options (she uses her one smuggled relic now, not later). Visible cost: three seasons' worth of rare truffles, the risk of failure, and the shift from solitude to potential shared use. The stranger's arrival functions as a tightening complication. However, the final beat (offering the relic to others) is gestured rather than tested on the page, softening the closure's bite slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (decode the woman's gesture) is signaled early but never tested by a complication or reversal. Hemlock's borrowed-memory power solves the mystery without friction or trade-off. The woman's story arrives complete via passive reception; no decision narrows options or forces sacrifice. The nightly flower gesture is tender but lacks visible cost—time, stamina, or social consequence are not dramatized. Escalation is absent; the arc is flat from inciting object to summary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the purpose of the chip and, ultimately, choosing his own path—is clear. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chip aligns with the symbols and opens the doorway, narrowing his option to either step inside or retreat. However, the escalation is compressed: the ants, cavern, and doorway unfold in rapid summary without dramatized resistance or a live choice under duress. The final act (pressing a finger to his map, a new line appearing) is decisive but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("the doorway would always be there") rather than felt through an on-page forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early and sustained through the climb. The story delivers one meaningful tightening (arrival at the grotto) and one reversal (memory recovery), but both are driven by spatial arrival rather than protagonist agency or forced trade-off. The seneschal's presence adds companionship but no friction; he confirms rather than complicates. The final "will you stay or return" question is posed by the seneschal, not wrestled by the queen on the page, and her smile answers without visible cost or foreclosed option. Escalation reads as accumulative density rather than causal pressure, meeting minimum under a Hybrid lens but lacking the sharpened choice or visible price for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to capture the density of presence"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she begins her work "methodical yet impassioned" and completes it without friction, error, or trade-off. Kael's secret should escalate pressure, but because it's never disclosed, it can't create a live dilemma. The resolution is convenience: Elara succeeds at her undefined task with no visible cost, and the final image ("their light did not fade") asserts triumph without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: distilling temporal chaos into narrative coherence to survive knowledge of his own death. One meaningful deepening occurs (the realization that backward-looking might be freedom), but it arrives via reflection rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The gravestone premise promises high stakes yet the story never tests Elias with a concrete decision—write versus not write, return to the grave versus stay away—that would demonstrate agency under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist action; the shift is perceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with her grandmother's legacy and her own lost senses—is signaled early and the screw examination provides one meaningful tightening when the inscription is revealed. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off; Elara's breakthrough costs her nothing on the page and no live option is foreclosed. The tears and scent return feel like reward without resistance, and coincidence (the inscription happening to be legible under magnification) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming scars into comprehensible stories—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the crystallization forces Aeris to commit (he cannot undo the change), and writing with his transformed hand narrows his options to full embodiment of the ritual. The cost is visible: his skin becomes permanently altered, a "smooth story of grief and acceptance" that he cannot hide. Agency is clear in his choice to clutch the quill, invoke the superstition, and scribe the prayer despite the terrifying transformation. The resolution is earned by his decision to write the child's secret rather than academic runes, aligning internal and external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (deliver apology to Alistair) is clear and present throughout. The oscillator provides one meaningful tightening: it succeeds where prior methods failed, narrowing options. However, the climax lacks a live trade-off or visible price—Alistair's forgiveness arrives without resistance, and no competing want (fear of rejection, cost to her reputation) complicates the choice. The ending dissolves sorrow into "peace" without foreclosing a path or altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—"unravel cosmic illusions"—is declared but never tested on the page with a concrete choice or sacrifice. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the witness walks, pauses, opens the dictionary, and dissolves without opposition or cost that changes tactics. "Spiral arbitration" is defined thematically ("weave them together") but no dramatized integration occurs where success or failure would matter. Agency is observation, not decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding what clocks measure. The stake is signaled early and remains consistent, but pressure doesn't escalate—Elias wonders, counts, notices a stutter, reviews his logbook, and concludes. The counting-backwards experiment is a tightening micro-beat, yet it doesn't foreclose an option or force a trade-off; he simply observes and then accepts his insight. No meaningful cost appears: his shift ends, he smiles, and his life's work is validated rather than challenged. Agency reads as passive observation culminating in intellectual satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—widening the father's perspective—is signaled early and remains coherent, but escalation is weak: each subway scrawl is a parallel data point rather than a tightening choice, and the father's reaction ("irresponsible," then "you've widened my perspective") arrives without visible trade-off or foreclosed option. No reversal narrows Elara's path, and no on-page cost (relational rupture, missed deadline, personal gamble) makes the resolution earned under Causal pressure. One meaningful deepening is present (the notebook delivery) but it lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching callers to begin after endings—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The piece describes years of nocturnal work without dramatizing one call or showing Archie's method under pressure. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the loop structure asserts repetition without demonstrating escalation or a choice that narrows options. Agency at closure is speculative ("whenever he chose"), and no visible price forecloses a path within the text.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving moments to honor the covenant and Melina's memory—is clear early. The move from annual ritual observation to finally documenting her proximate causes offers one tightening, and the locket offering narrows options (he cannot repeat this act). Yet the escalation proceeds without visible friction or trade-off; Elias's understanding deepens smoothly ("he began to understand the full scope") without a reversal or moment where new knowledge forces a harder choice. The ending reconfigures meaning but the cost of parting with the locket is told more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Orion climbs the ladder and confronts the sensory flood, which narrows his options from external quest to internal stance. The cost is legible (he trades the moon rock and his logistician's control for stillness), but the escalation lacks a second visible reversal or adaptation under pressure. The woman's deflection ("Me? Heavens no. I just swap the waypoints") complicates but doesn't force Orion to change tactics on-page; he simply complies. Agency is present but muted—his choice to ascend and listen is more acceptance than a forced trade-off with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (find the stillpoint) is signaled early and the three-note sequence provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The B flat "struck him like a physical blow, forcing him to his knees" gestures toward cost, but the resolution—"consumed his fear, his grief, his longing"—erases complexity without trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the ending grants "heart full" satisfaction without visible price or tactical sacrifice. Under Accumulative pressure, one decisive intensification is present, but the final reconfiguration does not narrow options or leave a felt wound on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to erase the past mistake or accept its consequences. One meaningful tightening occurs when the interpreter writes "The seed was never planted," sees the anomaly sag, feels the loss, and reverses the change—this narrows options and demonstrates cost. Agency is clear in the rewrite cycle. However, escalation is weak: the second attempt ("wrong soil, but they grew anyway") produces only minor cosmetic adjustment (anomaly "lessens just enough," stars "align differently"), not a deepened dilemma. The ending restates the achieved stance rather than testing it further; coincidence does not intrude, but pressure plateaus after the first reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"make them remember" via translating silence—is announced early but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening; the sequence is: they stand, they sign, they click the camera, they declare success. The final camera click and "their work done" offer zero resistance, cost, or complication. Agency is absent; no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The piece drifts through mood rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early but never tightened by genuine opposition or trade-off. Each fragment discovery is convenient; no reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price that alters later tactics. The final burning is framed as absolution rather than sacrifice, and she walks away at peace, rendering the resolution feelgood rather than earned. One micro-turn (discovering the map beneath the defaced eyes) does not constitute escalation when no cost accrues.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the shared dream—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition. Kael's drumming produces the desired resonance immediately; no reversal, complication, or escalation narrows his options. The "experimenters" are mentioned as a threat but never appear or interfere, leaving the conflict inert. The ending declares success ("the shared dream lived on") without visible cost or trade-off, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and tested on-page via the whisper/shout contrast, delivering one clear tightening. However, Kael's agency feels low-friction: he already possesses the theory, maps, coin, and key; no obstacle forces a trade-off or tactical shift. Jenna's arrival and immediate capitulation after one demonstration deflates opposition. The final handoff of the coin erases the bet's cost rather than deepening it. One earned reversal (the successful test) meets minimum scope, but lack of visible price or foreclosed path holds this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Anna seeks help to "see" and resolve grief. Pressure remains static—she approaches, watches, perceives, cries—but no reversal or tightening narrows her options. The guardian's arrangement is complete before she arrives, rendering her passive recipient rather than agent. The pattern reveal delivers information but does not force a trade-off or foreclose a path with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is required; here the ending repeats the opening's meditative register without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—shifting the town's consciousness through synchronized displays—is signaled early, but Arthur faces no on-page opposition, reversal, or tightening that narrows his options. The displays activate as planned with no hitch, and the "rippling" curiosity is told rather than dramatized through a concrete encounter or cost. Agency remains curatorial (arranging, calculating, smiling) rather than forced into a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the final beat restates the premise without reweighting it through visible price or altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding freedom by embracing true nature—is signaled but never tested by a competing cost. Elara swims to the island, takes a charm, dives back; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid (relationships, job security, physical stamina). The "violence she'd never committed" and "peace as prison" motifs are introduced but abandoned without on-page friction. Pressure remains atmospheric (whale call intensity, scrimshaw glow) rather than tactical; coincidence (finding the scrimshaw, island appearing) drives all major turns. One deepening occurs—realizing the scrimshaw is testament to defiance—but it does not narrow her choices or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating authentic feeling under the happiness mandate—is clear and shapes Elara's choices throughout. The unexpected inspector knock provides a complication that tests Elara's performance skill, and the palming of the hummingbird mid-scene introduces minor escalation. Yet the resolution (inspector departs satisfied; Elara completes the ritual) does not narrow options or foreclose a path with legible cost—Elara's situation and tactics remain unchanged. The agency displayed is endurance and continuation rather than a choice that transforms stakes. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is present (the unscheduled knock) but the pressure does not reweight options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—crossing the boundary—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Kael's dissolution into "light and sound" constitutes one meaningful deepening under an Accumulative lens, narrowing his form and expanding perception. Yet the crossing itself is frictionless: no persistent constraint alters his tactics, no reversal tests commitment, and the resolution grants him mastery "beyond the constraints of words" without visible price. Agency reads as capability demonstration rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives or incurs cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake: Leo's desire to awaken his dormant sense of color. The plant-arrangement plea tightens into Lyra's silent three-gesture question, then the barter is struck, narrowing options (he commits a season's labor). The awakening itself—reed over iris, hum, fractured gray blooming into spectrum—delivers a decisive sensory reversal with embodied cost (the labor debt) legible on the page. The pressure coheres under the causal lens and the final beat reweights his prior monochrome world with visible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake ("to discover the texture of connection") is signaled early but remains abstract. The bell ringer moves through the lab, strikes a tuning fork, and steps into the light—yet none of these actions narrow options or force a tradeoff with visible cost. The lab's harmonic shift and the lens glowing are responses, not obstacles. No live option is foreclosed; the protagonist's agency is observational and declarative ("sound is the key") rather than tested by resistance. One beat of pressure (the question "Why do we only measure what is gone?") gestures toward conflict but does not escalate or deepen through causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into purpose—is stated early but never tested on the page through a concrete dilemma or reversal. Elian's teaching unfolds without resistance, failure, or trade-off; students arrive, learn, and propagate the mission in summary. No escalation: the piece moves laterally through time ("months," "quiet nights") without narrowing options or raising cost. Coincidence doesn't resolve because there's no problem dramatized to resolve—the entire arc is retrospective summary of a completed transformation rather than pressure building toward a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to map cultural patterns and share her discovery—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when she decides to confide in Chen, but this moment lacks genuine opposition or trade-off; Chen responds with "growing astonishment" and supportive questions, offering validation rather than resistance. No live option is foreclosed, and the cost of sharing her unconventional method remains abstract (societal reaction is mentioned but not dramatized). The resolution simply restates her commitment without escalation or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—purifying atoms of nostalgia—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through on-page resistance. No failed attempt, adaptive move, or visible price alters her tactics; she begins the ritual and completes it across summarized days without a single dramatized complication. The assertion that prior historians failed does not generate present-scene pressure. Agency defaults to endurance without demonstrating what path she forecloses or what competing cost she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page scene tests Elara's commitment with a visible trade-off. The unbound shadows complicate the situation, yet the story offers no reversal or tightening choice where Elara's decision narrows options or imposes cost. The resolution ("By dawn, the transformation was complete") is summarized, eliding the pressure moment where success or failure would crystallize. Agency reads as retrospective analysis rather than high-stakes decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing trust and deciding how to respond to the foundation's betrayal—is signaled early. The piece offers a tightening through Maria's methodical log review and Eleanor's challenge, but Maria's stance crystallizes without visible trade-off: she will launch a transparent sanctuary and extend compassion, yet no on-page choice forces her to surrender a competing value or resource. The hawk metaphor ("shed infected tissue") asserts escalation through analogy rather than dramatizing a pressure point where options narrow with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is Maya's recognition that erasing scars erases stories, signaled early. The tightening occurs when plant whispers force her to re-see Mrs. Chen's request and her own scars, then the Samuel visit provides a modest escalation. However, the turn is cognitive rather than forced by external resistance; Samuel's acceptance arrives without friction, and the decision to change her practice faces no on-page obstacle or visible sacrifice of income, reputation, or patient expectations. Pressure accumulates under a lyric-Causal hybrid but the cost remains conceptual and future-oriented.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—locating where unused love is stored—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gazer discovers the answer resides in "when" rather than "where," but this realization arrives through passive perception, not a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No visible price is paid; the gazer simply releases the film strip and gains peace. Agency is observation, not decision or renunciation with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is declared but never tested through a choice or trade-off. Elara follows the stars' urging without resistance, complication, or visible cost; the astrolabe "does its work" passively. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the sequence is additive rather than escalatory. The protagonist's agency is absent: she obeys cosmic whispers rather than making decisions that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring life to dying lands—is signaled early and the guard's nightly practice escalates to seedling extraction and planting. The moment of transfer (seedling pulse entangling with his consciousness, chess clock ticking backward) narrows options and the branching futures shown across the dune raise tactical cost (nurture one timeline without overwriting others). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and the final act reweights archived possibility into waking-world consequence. One friction: the conflict remains largely internal and procedural; no antagonist or complicating force tests the guard's method, so escalation reads as smooth execution rather than forced choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding and controlling translocation—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure tightens as Elian moves to the convergence and focuses on the symphony of artificial breezes, resulting in a deliberate translocation instead of random shift. Yet the escalation is conceptual and internally narrated rather than tested by external opposition or trade-off. The resolution (consciousness expanding, gear rearranging) is delivered without visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no sacrifice made on the page. Agency is present but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("find where unused courage waits") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page obstacle that the traveler must overcome or renounce. No reversal or tightening—the guides lead, the traveler follows, and the resolution (light withdrawn from pool) is handed to them without struggle. Coincidence (pool appears, courage is already inside) resolves the premise without protagonist agency. Cost is asserted ("gently persistent") but no visible price is paid, no option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bellhop finds the ledger and realizes "the fortress's safety came at the cost of its people." However, the escalation is cognitive (a fact learned) rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The final decision to remain carries stated resolve but no on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a live alternative we saw him consider.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the offstage scholar/guard captain receiving cryptic messages, the pretender's growing paranoia, and his arrival at the library. However, the protagonist remains reactive until the final beat; the pretender's breach of the temporal drift is coincidence, not earned by Kael's tactical choices. The spoken rune and ink flick provide a single tightening at closure, but no prior on-page reversal tests Kael's commitment or narrows his options. The cost (the pretender's collapse) is external; Kael's personal sacrifice or forfeiture is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens when Elias notices the rhythm in the atlas page aligning with tide timings. One meaningful deepening occurs: the console numbers rearrange to mirror the lost coastline, narrowing his inquiry from grief to pattern recognition. Agency at closure is a renunciation of static witness in favor of walking the changed paths, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized; we do not see what he leaves behind or what the walk forecloses. The revelation that "paths were never straight" reconfigures his quest, yet coincidence (finding the page, noticing the rhythm weeks ago) does much of the work rather than protagonist-driven escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning to restart the stalled rebellion—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure is situational: the lull forces a stance crystallization. One tightening occurs when the protagonist touches the stone and the hum intensifies, but this moment lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option; the "spark" arrives without dramatized cost. The rebellion's leaders are gone, yet their absence functions as backdrop rather than an on-page constraint that narrows her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing the embryo to evolve tradition—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: Maeva faces the New Regime's curfew as an obstacle but no on-page consequence tests her commitment. The unsealing succeeds without visible resistance, cost, or trade-off; the "wave of potential" grants her goal cleanly. One deepening occurs (realizing the script is a key), but it narrows options through insight rather than agency under duress. The cost at closure is thematic, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Maya's capacity to integrate trauma without erasure—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The transcendent freeze while transplanting sea thrift provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her options from concealment to acknowledgment. Framing the photograph forecloses the hiding path with on-page cost (vulnerability, permanence of memory). Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length. The escalation is protagonist-driven (her choice to frame and display), and the cost is unmistakable in the shift from crumpled/hidden to framed/visible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding after fracture—is signaled early. The mending of the box provides a single on-page action sequence, but it unfolds without meaningful resistance, trade-off, or cost; each piece aligns "like the bones of a forgotten thing" with no failed attempt or alternate path considered. The artist's transformation lacks a visible price: no former method abandoned, no relationship or prior self-image forfeited. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation should read as density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake, yet the final third repeats the affirming rhetoric without a tightening or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why time slows in crisis—is signaled early but remains abstract and observational. Kael's journey from encampment to ridge to ink observation reads as linear accumulation without a reversal or tightening that forecloses options. The drone's "alarm" chirp is noted but does not force a trade-off; Kael "had expected this." The ending delivers insight without visible price: his anger is "tempered" and "reshaped," steps are "lighter," and he allows himself "peace." Escalation under the accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the resolution softens rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—releasing contraband truths to provoke conversation—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or reversal. Elara faces no on-page obstacle: no alarms sound during her upload, no internal hesitation stalls her hand, and her escape is frictionless. The piece moves in a straight line from decision to execution to flight, with escalation asserted ("the council would hunt her") rather than dramatized. Agency is present in her initial choice, but that choice costs nothing visible on the page—she smiles and feels "at peace," undercutting the declared sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.6)
    A dominant stake—maintaining her pacifist sanctuary—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Elara moves through her routines without opposition or cost. The merchants' impending arrival could introduce pressure, but the story ends before any confrontation or choice materializes. Agency is absent at closure; she simply continues her established practice without forfeiting anything or crystallizing a stance under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and pursued with a clear ritual escalation (zigzag carving silence, translating longing, triggering the cosmic response). One meaningful tightening occurs when the garden falters and the stars pulse in sync, narrowing the fisher's ritual toward success. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative; the echo is caught without a dramatized cost that alters the fisher's options or forces a sacrifice, keeping escalation in mid-7s rather than higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving her parents were murdered—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara finds the star chart and realizes the "contradiction" her father taught her. However, the escalation relies on retrospective reasoning rather than on-page pressure that narrows options. The final decision to publish carries no dramatized cost, obstacle, or trade-off; no authority figure threatens her, no resource is spent, no relationship is tested. The "proof by contradiction" method is summarized rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing trapped sounds and confronting guilt—is signaled early, but escalation is diffuse. The piece traces a single tightening (amber begins resonating → device translates Orion's voice → preparation of Lacerta tattoo), yet this sequence feels like discovery rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options. Agency is largely receptive (Orion learns, understands, prepares) rather than a decision with visible tradeoff. The cost (guilt "tethered properly") is asserted in the denouement without an on-page action that forecloses a live alternative, keeping the score in mid-band despite coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early and Elara's agency (creating the mandala, positioning the tile flake) drives the tightening when the emergent hush responds. One meaningful escalation occurs: her realization that she must "not fight it but interject into its flow" changes tactics and the patterns reveal a method. However, the final act lacks visible trade-off or price; the whispers return and she smiles without forfeiting an option or paying a dramatized cost, reading as convenient empowerment rather than earned choice with stakes. The Cost Proof Test in Q4 is not met: no sentence shows what Elara sacrificed or risked to achieve reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming the plaza through renaming—is signaled early. Pressure is sustained through Elara's retrocognitive loop and the physical ritual, but escalation reads more as iterative accumulation (first stone, next stone, implicit continuation) than a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The tessera placement is a single meaningful gesture, sufficient for this length, yet the cost of her choice (what path is foreclosed?) remains implied rather than made visible on the page. Agency is present in her deliberate ritual work, but no live alternative is dramatized and rejected.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—save the theater from demolition—is signaled early. Arthur's whistling routine with the amplified tarot coin constitutes one meaningful tightening, as it escalates his power beyond gentle echoes. However, the escalation relies on off-page effects (the owner's daughter and developer respond miles away) rather than on-page resistance or complication. No on-page reversal or friction tests Arthur's commitment; the coin works as intended, and the theater is saved without visible trade-off. The resolution lacks felt cost: Arthur places the coin down with no dramatized renunciation or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—filter the psychic noise before it erodes her—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara executes her plan without friction, setback, or a moment where the somatic markers overwhelm her control and force a costly choice. The "hours bled into one another" compresses the work, and the tightening ("the noise didn't vanish, but it organized") is declared rather than dramatized through a specific failed attempt or renunciation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the story offers summary of effort rather than an on-page escalation that narrows options or reveals a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to translate the caves' silence into meaning—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece tightens once when the fossil floats and visions flood her, offering new understanding, but this deepening is delivered to her rather than earned through her agency under pressure. No visible cost or foreclosed option appears; the spiral shell sequence repeats the pattern without escalation, and the ending celebrates discovery without dramatizing a trade-off or price paid for crossing into the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("unscramble the fate foretold for her village") is declared early but never tightened—no moment where a wrong button choice threatens the prophecy or where the echo fades if she delays. The cataloging proceeds without reversal or deepening; the final button placement triggers the resolution rather than testing her commitment. Agency is present (she sorts and places) but the cost is missing: no option foreclosed, no tactical trade-off, no visible consequence of her method versus an alternative she considered and rejected.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: protecting/freeing Althea from the service and his own ruin. The coordinates and tomorrow's date promise a trap, but Elias's agency centers on composing a counter-message rather than engaging the trap itself. The tightening occurs when he chooses invitation over warning, vouchsafe over rescue, but this turn happens off-page between paragraphs; we see preparation and resolution, not the moment of choice. Cost is conceptual (his erasure, her freedom) but the trade-off is told rather than shown in a pressured beat. No reversal or complication tests his resolve once the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (fulfilling the palimpsest promise) is declared but never tested; the coachman waits passively until the figure arrives. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the fog lifts and the figure appears as scheduled convenience. The handover lacks visible cost—no forfeited path, no trade-off, only asserted lightness. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density or pattern break; here it dissipates into relief without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding why the oasis resists decay. The escalation under Accumulative lens shows a meaningful deepening: Kael moves from sensing dissonance → charting shadows → discovering the logbook's echo of kindness → using smoke and glass to see the core → realizing preservation rather than catastrophe. The final tightening—his hand on the fracture, offering presence—narrows options (he cannot force repair) and the thrum softening is a legible pressure release. Agency is present but contemplative; Kael's choices are observational and patient, which suits character but reduces felt stakes. No antagonist or external resistance tests his commitment; the anomaly yields to his nature without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—bringing light to dark spaces—is signaled early and maintained. The installation sequence accumulates detail but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; the superintendent's acceptance removes potential opposition without conflict. No on-page cost alters tactics: the gardener completes his system, then maintains it, with no trade-off or forfeited path visible in the ending. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("translate isolation into independence") is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist drifts through reflection without a live choice that forecloses a path. The story declares escalation ("each brittle awakening had been preparing her") yet shows no pressure point where want conflicts with cost. Agency is missing: Elara's final stance is a passive acceptance rather than a decision with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks "the thread that connects all things." The sculpture walk provides one meaningful tightening (tracing the spiral with the nest as key), and the final flood of interconnected secrets delivers a reweighting. However, agency is passive—Elias is guided, feels a pull, receives insight—rather than making a choice that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; no live option is rejected. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but lacks the felt cost or trade-off that would elevate the score into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (stopping cosmic manipulation) is declared but never tested on the page. Elara faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or tactical dilemma—she conceives the plan and executes it in a single ellipsis. The "power plays among university departments" and "community divisions" are told-only background without bearing on her choices. No reversal, tightening, or visible cost appears; coincidence (she happens to have the right technology) solves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring spatial stability—is declared early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or cost. The explorer executes the plan in a single smooth sequence with no failed attempts, resource losses, or tactical shifts; the nexus "responds" and "settles" without forcing a trade-off. Agency is minimal: the key "materializes," the mechanism "awaits," and the organ music does the work while she "broadcasts the key's pattern" passively. The psychological "confrontation" of claustrophobia is asserted in narration but never dramatizes a moment where fleeing would alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing Lena's story to awaken empathy—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the methodical process (finding ribbon, sketching, merging opposites), creating one meaningful deepening as the portrait takes form and "the image sharpened." However, no reversal or tightening choice narrows Elias's options; he works without obstacle or internal conflict that tests his commitment. The resolution lacks a visible price: he simply completes the portrait and leaves it, with no indication of what this ritual costs him or forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring the ancestor by understanding his work—is signaled early, but pressure remains fairly static until the climax. The nail insertion and coordinate alignment represent one turn that narrows options, but the journal's warning about "discovery versus silence" is summarized rather than tested through on-page dilemma. Elias's hesitation is brief and resolved by a single decision without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. The "reversible exile" concept is mentioned but not leveraged to create escalating choices or tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the impossible real—is declared early but never tested by a live cost. Elara's nightly vigil and fragment assembly unfold over "months" without visible trade-off: no lost income, damaged relationships, or physical toll that narrows her options. The climax moment ("she felt the air begin to shimmer") offers no choice or renunciation; she plays, understands, and continues. One tightening occurs when the scaffold map is decoded, but it opens discovery rather than foreclosing a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding cyclical paths versus escaping them—is signaled early and sustained. Jasper's investment decision and departure from the startup are clear turns, but both occur in summary with minimal on-page agency or visible tradeoff in the moment. The startup's fall and Elena's manipulation are told ("users began to realize their choices were no longer their own") rather than dramatized through a scene that forces Jasper to choose. One meaningful tightening exists (Elena's pitch of manipulation → Jasper's silent exit), yet the cost remains conceptual and retrospective rather than felt in real time. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is present but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: decode the temple inscriptions. One tightening occurs when Whitmore reveals the prophecy and his wife's death, shifting Elara's understanding. However, Elara's agency is minimal—she asks a question, the professor explains, and they collaborate. No on-page decision narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the resolution is a mutual agreement to share work, not a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (confronting frozen guilt) is signaled early. Pressure is declared ("vortex pulled him in") but the druid's agency consists of a single forward step and spell repetition without visible trade-offs or narrowing options. The seed "fulfilled" its purpose off-stage (it "fell from his hand, sinking into the depths") without showing what that purpose was or what the druid risked or lost. The resolution summarizes emotional release without demonstrating a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the intersection where realities can speak and mend the eclipsed covenant. One meaningful tightening occurs at the oak when Elias presses his scar to the fissure, a physical cost that enables passage. The nexus recognition scene deepens understanding (the future's loneliness, the dream's abandonment) and the two figures turn toward each other—a shift in stance. However, Elias's agency at the climax is observational ("saw the problem with impossible clarity") rather than a decision with trade-off; holding up his hand reads as demonstration, not sacrifice. Cost is felt (the scar tingles, passage is "searing") but remains more sensory than volitional.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—fixing the "destiny he'd tried to claim and nearly lost"—is signaled early. The ritual sequence provides one meaningful deepening when Elian feels the stranger's memories and offers to "patch the holes in each other's souls." However, the stranger remains abstract; no genuine opposition tests Elian's resolve. The roots bind "not in pain, but in binding," softening what could be a costly tightening. The fruit arrives as reward without a visible trade-off that alters tactics or forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: discover purpose after loss, signaled early. One tightening occurs when Leo realizes "the real work often began when the cheering stopped," narrowing his self-concept. However, no external antagonist or constraint forces a trade-off; Leo's decision to leave the inventory unfinished is a renunciation but lacks visible immediate cost (no boss on the page, no money lost, no relationship altered). The pressure is primarily internal and reflective, cohering under Accumulative lens but without a dramatized price that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (complete Hamid's research, understand transition physics) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or complication. The breakthrough arrives via summary ("her analogical approach yielded breakthroughs") without on-page escalation or a visible choice that narrows options. The seed germinates "within minutes" without cost, obstacle, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening tests Maris's commitment; the resolution is delivered rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—"to preserve wonder in routine"—is declared but never tested on the page. No visitor challenges the system, no gear fails, no identity migration causes friction; the librarian moves through a smooth ritual without obstacle, reversal, or tightening. The piece treats "after tomorrow disappears" and moon-phase identity shifts as worldbuilding features rather than pressure that narrows options. Agency is absent: the librarian performs preset tasks with no decision that forecloses a path or demonstrates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—dissolving emotional walls—is signaled early but never tested with a meaningful trade-off. Elias faces no resistance, doubt, or cost when he reveals the pearl's power; the residents simply accept the transformation. The gathering in the second section presents a potential pressure point, but "expressions shifted from doubt to wonder" without dramatized conflict. No on-page reversal narrows options; the pearl's magic solves the isolation problem without Elias sacrificing or risking anything concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Elias reads the graffiti warnings, walks north toward "bad waters," and confronts the memory of his father's drowning. The bellows toss is a renunciation, but it arrives after he's already narrated the insight ("it was something to become"), so the action feels confirmatory rather than a live choice under duress. One meaningful tightening (the north-to-south pivot) is present, but the final cost is muted by summary phrasing ("a weight released").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stated stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is achieved by arrival in paragraph one, deflating forward pressure. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the dreamer documents, observes, and "understands" without agency that forecloses a path. The propagation delays and cipher unfold automatically, driven by the watch and library rather than protagonist decision. The ending promises return rather than closing a cost; coincidence (receiving letters) initiates and will restore access, resolving through externality.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—authenticate and decide the violin's fate—is signaled early. One tightening: coffee stains show Clementine's name linked to the emperor's, narrowing her options from researcher to participant. However, the peak choice (taking the violin and fleeing) happens off-page; we see only aftermath (notes and a string left behind). The Imperial Agent's arrival at midnight creates a deadline, but coincidence (his five-minute delay) permits escape without visible tradeoff. Agency reads as decision with cost implied rather than on-page and felt, keeping this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled: extracting the memory before decay. Yet the protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacle—no failed attempt, no ambiguous signal, no cost to the retrieval itself. The sequence is linear: she waits, finds the pattern, infuses the chip, succeeds. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening moment or pattern break would suffice, but here the "coarse grain of decay" does not complicate her method or force a tactical shift. The cost ("voyager's face… settled into deeper repose") is passive and lacks felt consequence for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—to find contentment—is declared but never tested on the page; the caretaker's climb and reflections do not encounter opposition or a live choice that narrows options. The ending pronouncement ("contentment is in the caretaking itself") is stated rather than earned through a turn that forecloses an alternative path. No reversal, trade-off, or visible price appears; the new soul's arrival is coincidental and does not require protagonist agency. Escalation is absent under any lens; the sequence reads as a single static ritual beat without pressure increase or cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—helping Lyra's brother welcome nuance into certainty—is signaled early and pursued through the chime arrangement. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chime melody provokes Lyra's tears and her decision to leave the shard. Agency lies in Elian's method and Lyra's renunciation, both on-page. Cost is visible in her tearful release and his acceptance of the artifact. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no reversals required, and the resolution is earned by protagonist method.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara learning to vanish/appear—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through hours of observation, and the trance deepens, but no live option is foreclosed. The final act (standing in the pond) registers as arrival rather than trade-off. Escalation is more accumulative than causal, fitting the lens, but visible cost is absent; Kael's "long-held purpose fulfilled" is told satisfaction, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (learning to navigate without moving) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the appraisal sequence. However, escalation is largely internal and contemplative; no live option is narrowed or tactical trade-off forced. The arrowhead revelation deepens understanding but does not compel a high-cost choice or foreclose a path—Kael's situation at the end remains structurally identical to the opening, differing only in insight.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: rediscovering magic with soul versus automated precision. The mist-walking ascent provides a meaningful tightening—Kael steps off the spire into impossibility—but the resolution (placing the keystone, feeling connection) is largely internal and contemplative. No visible price or trade-off narrows later options; the automated systems continue unaware, and Kael descends with "the memory of authentic creation" rather than a dramatized cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (unlock synesthesia to honor brother's memory) is clear, but escalation lacks on-page friction—Orion faces no obstacles during the dive, the journal decodes without error, and the ritual succeeds on first attempt. No live option is foreclosed; the vow is fulfilled without trade-off or visible price paid in the moment. The anniversary timing creates calendar pressure but not tactical urgency; coincidence (cosmic convergence, perfect conditions) enables rather than complicates resolution. One tightening occurs (cutting the engine, beginning the dive) but no reversal tests commitment or alters tactics mid-descent.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—encoding humanity's message for the next universe—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page obstacle or reversal forces Elara to trade one value for another; "stellar doubt" dissolves conveniently when she understands her purpose. The singularity's compression is atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint that alters her tactics. Closure reads as a cosmic assertion ("The cycle continued") rather than a choice with visible cost that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The act of naming each monster provides a series of micro-escalations that crystallize his grief, and the final choice to leave them behind forecloses burial and denial. However, no live opposition tests his commitment; the monsters never resist, and no reversal forces a trade-off. The cost is more existential proclamation ("made the pain more tangible") than a visible price that alters later tactics within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—righting cosmic imbalance via the bell—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bell seals but the world remains "unbalanced," forcing a micro-revision ("tuned" rather than "mended"). However, this tightening doesn't foreclose a live option with visible cost; Kael's "earnestly naive hope renewed" suggests he can continue attempts without penalty. Agency is present but low-pressure: pouring water and mumbling an incantation lack genuine struggle or competing goods. The drip-rate method accumulates atmosphere but doesn't escalate stakes through reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the drowned town's memory through storytelling—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or internal conflict. The warden's ritual proceeds without reversal, complication, or a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful escalation occurs; the photographs are placed sequentially without cost or trade-off. The wind chime's silence and the water's stir suggest thematic weight but do not alter tactics or raise stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—achieving harmonized understanding through the crystal transformation—is signaled early and sustained. The piece offers one meaningful tightening when Elara adjusts the flame based on starling patterns, raising technical precision. However, no on-page reversal or visible cost accompanies the transformation's success; the crystal "had not changed in any measurable way, yet somehow it had become entirely different" is asserted, not dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, this lacks the concrete price or tactical shift required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—"preserve trust under pressure"—is declared but never tested on the page. The seeker's leap is the only action, yet it does not narrow options or reveal a trade-off; the radio voice at the end arrives as gift rather than consequence. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the piece lingers in contemplation without pressure rising or tactics changing. Coincidence (the voice calling) supplies the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—claiming the brain to prove he is the survivor—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the clone's grip and Kael's realization he must "make it choose" narrows his tactic from simply waking the brain to an emotional gambit. The clone dissolves as a direct result of Kael's action, satisfying causal escalation under the chosen lens. Cost is visible in that the clone is destroyed and Kael is left alone, but the price feels more conceptual than visceral—no stamina drain, injury, or relational loss marks the page beyond the stated loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—restore his daughter's laughter to the silent household—is signaled in the opening paragraph. Physical escalation is present: arm burning, pressed closer, voice growing louder and more insistent. However, the pressure remains largely internal and procedural; no external complication or internal doubt threatens failure. The "shift, a vibration" and subsequent cascade feel inevitable rather than hard-won, and the resolution grants him complete success without trade-off or lasting cost beyond exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—making friends with uncertainty—is signaled early. The pendant's arrival provides one meaningful tightening: Sylvan must choose between shattering or internalizing it, and he chooses the latter. The escalation is modest (one reversal), and the cost is conceptual rather than visible; we're told the pendant "softened" and the ache became "a warm echo," but agency and price remain abstract. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is present, yet the story would benefit from a dramatized tradeoff that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping a "suffocating destiny"—is signaled early, and the five approximations provide a rhythm of escalation. However, the deepening occurs through summary ("the third approximation revealed," "the fourth approximation bubbled") rather than dramatized choices that narrow options with visible cost. No persistent constraint (time, material scarcity, physical danger) shapes tactics; the process succeeds simply by repetition until the fifth try works. The final image reweights meaning but lacks a felt tradeoff or forfeiture that would charge the closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—to decode the signal—is signaled early and pursued through a single tightening: Elias discards assumptions, tunes deeper, and locates the signal's source within the fragment. However, escalation is minimal; the signal "strengthens" and "resolves" without reversals or trade-offs that narrow options. The discovery is confirmation rather than a turn that forecloses a path. No secondary pressure (time, resource, risk) complicates his work, and the ending awards him the answer without dramatized cost, leaving the stake abstract and the resolution frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—merge parallel timelines—is signaled early and drives the third act. Pressure builds as "realities merged," "timelines stabilized," and "the strain threatened to tear the grotto apart," but these beats are told rather than dramatized through a concrete choice that narrows options. No on-page reversal tests Elijah's commitment; he adjusts frequencies and the merge succeeds without visible trade-off or a moment where failure seemed imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens once when Siran shifts from precision to abandon, a meaningful tightening. The reversal (pure memory resists; regret-dyed thread succeeds) is causal and protagonist-driven. However, the cost is abstract: "sinew thread burned away" with only "scent of ozone and closure" as consequence. No live option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered for the next beat. The escalation is present but the price lacks material bite.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching starlight navigation to people who've never seen stars—is signaled early and remains coherent, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elias's options. The lesson proceeds smoothly from projection to explanation to student engagement without complication; the student's question "when do you think we'll actually see the stars?" is answered with reassurance rather than friction. Agency at closure is observation and reflection rather than a decision that forecloses a path, and the "somber marvel" Elias feels is contemplative rather than a choice forced by escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—clearing the sister's name—is signaled midway rather than early, diluting pressure buildup. One meaningful tightening occurs when "strong pulses" lead to the music box, but the discovery itself unfolds through exposition (documents "revealed a truth") rather than a choice that forecloses options. No visible cost attaches to Aria's success; she will present evidence to authorities, a future intention without on-page consequence. The scratched photograph mystery deepens partway through, offering one reversal, but escalation lacks protagonist agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to her mentor and the trapped researchers—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density rather than decision points; Eliza encounters no obstacles, makes no tactical shifts, and faces no reversals. The tightening occurs in the final act when the gold fleck synchronizes with the cables and she begins to dissolve, but this is enacted upon her rather than driven by her agency. The cost (leaving physical existence) is conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally felt in the moment. Under an Accumulative lens this passes, but agency remains weak.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—helping Aris defragment her memories to find meaning in failure—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elias spreads ink, Aris transmits, patterns form, insight arrives without reversal or narrowing of options. No on-page cost alters tactics; the atmospheric pulse backstory is recounted rather than tested. The final exchange offers warmth but does not foreclose a live alternative or exact a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the piece describes the ritual without escalating its stakes or demonstrating what Elias or Aris must surrender to achieve "midnight solace."

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve the language through texture-sound translation. One meaningful tightening occurs mid-story when Kaelen synchronizes copper frequencies with bird patterns and bone texture, narrowing the method. However, escalation is smooth rather than forced by agency under pressure; no live option is foreclosed or traded off. The "curse" reframes as gift without visible sacrifice or cost that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates but the final reweighting lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias reclaiming agency from his sister's loss—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful turn occurs when the Jester reframes bitterness ("Your sister became punchline"), lightening Elias's rage. The arrowhead drop reads as renunciation but lacks visible cost; it's a gesture rather than a trade-off that forecloses tactics or alters later options. Lyra's entrance complicates but does not escalate pressure in a way that forces Elias to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and coheres through the playing sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the statues reach the bridge, forcing the violinist to play faster rather than flee, but the escalation lacks a visible trade-off; her triumph costs her nothing on the page. The city's pause and the flower's emergence read as symbolic rewards rather than complications that test her commitment. The final chord resolves conflict through aesthetic force alone, missing the calculus of competing goods or unavoidable harms that would charge the ending with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (deliver tissue sample to medic daughter without detection) is signaled early and tightens when the drone patrol reaches zenith, narrowing the window to three seconds. Agency is clear: Kael's choice to deploy the storm-bottle and shift the book drives the escalation. The visible cost—spent bottle, logged surge, created absence—forecloses repeat use and alters the system's search behavior. One meaningful deepening occurs when the manifest discrepancy triggers a manual search of the *remaining* parcels, a tactic shaped by Kael's prior planning.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elian seeking salvage/restoration—is signaled early but shifts abruptly to self-reclamation without prior friction. The halo fragment introduces one reversal (discovering the sanctuary), but escalation is minimal: Elian faces no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. The final act (singing) is enabled by the fragment's magic rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid—warmth and music arrive without cost. Pressure remains static rather than tightening under coherent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal, trade-off, or tightening choice that narrows options. The librarian walks, traces, steps through a portal, and returns without any visible cost, opposition, or escalation; the "hyperbolic space" reweights nothing because no prior constraint was established. Coincidence (a "subtle hum") initiates the sequence, and convenience (the scarf as compass, the door appearing) resolves it. No protagonist agency or felt price is legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("capture a runaway dream") is signaled but never tested—no false start, setback, or trade-off. The ritual (photography, painting with light) succeeds on first attempt without friction, and the resolution is summarized ("he had done it") rather than dramatized with visible cost. No moment narrows options or forces the librarian to choose between competing goods. The lack of meaningful escalation under any lens prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake ("free an idea trapped behind fear") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. The locksmith's humming proceeds unimpeded; "fear's defense" (overwhelming scent, disorienting geometry) presses in but does not force a tactical shift or cost-bearing decision. The "soundless snap" resolution arrives via stated resonance rather than protagonist agency navigating a narrowed choice. No visible price is paid—no stamina cost, no forfeiture of another client or resource—leaving escalation abstract and closure consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—recover stolen memories and understand her draw to this place—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the memories flood back and she learns her role. However, the escalation is driven by the light-beings' exposition rather than Elara's agency; she studies patterns, then the solution is handed to her via dialogue. The cost at closure is conceptual (accepting a protective role) but not felt or visible on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The accumulative lens would allow conceptual repricing, but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's readiness to return—is signaled, but the exile is told retrospectively, so no on-page pressure tests it. The reunion materializes without friction: Marcus understands immediately, and Elara's nervousness evaporates. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the "geometry of tea leaves" confirms stability rather than complicating it. The outcome feels declared rather than earned under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the Chroma Blossom—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet there is no on-page reversal, complication, or tightening that narrows Elianor's options or raises cost. She kneels, gathers essence, releases it, and the seed germinates exactly as intended. The accumulative lens allows for deepening through density, but the lack of any friction or trade-off leaves the escalation flat. Agency is present in the decision to act, but no path is foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: free the trapped spirits by unraveling the net's knots. Pressure accumulates through the sequence (three knots, then the resistant fourth, then the final knot revealing collective memory). The fourth knot's resistance provides a micro-turn that deepens understanding. However, agency at closure is thin—Elias realizes a thematic truth but does not face a trade-off or foreclosed path with visible cost; the spirits "steady" without a dramatized price paid by the protagonist. Escalation reads as sequential accumulation rather than tightening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—reopening the whispered chapel—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates or tightens options. Elias encounters no obstacles, reversals, or costs; each step (setup, alignment, ritual) succeeds as planned. The "discovery" is perceptual, not a choice that forecloses alternatives. No agency-driven turn narrows his path, and coincidence (the distortion appearing at 3:47 AM in both recordings) facilitates rather than complicates resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias learning to let go—is signaled early and pursued across three transmissions, creating a clear arc. The third transmission (scream-then-silence) delivers a meaningful turn that reweights his quest, forcing him to confront absence rather than mastery. Yet the escalation reads as conceptual rather than tactical: no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid in the moment. Arthur observes rather than opposes, and Elias's decision to stop ("I'm done here") arrives as realization rather than renunciation under pressure. The cost remains implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—completing the ghost's message before the storm closes the window—is signaled and tightens once ("worked faster, his movements becoming almost frantic"). However, the escalation remains atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist choice; the storm intensifies externally, and he simply finishes on time. No reversal or trade-off; the resolution is smooth completion without visible cost. The ghost's approval and the balladeer's smile confirm success without forfeiture, trending toward satisfied closure rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding the diary—is signaled early but resolved by coincidence (finding the goggles, angling them perfectly) rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful tightening occurs; each floor simply unlocks the next block of exposition without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The final "continuation of a legacy" is declared without on-page cost, and Elara's "ascent" is a promotion she neither earned through struggle nor refused with consequence. Escalation collapses into sequential revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is declared early but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elias's journal entry and whispered assertion ("You remember") occur without a reversal that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The gondola's passive descent and safe landing deflate any threat of physical consequence. No live antagonist, time pressure, or resource scarcity escalates the drift into a forced choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (paint the sky before demolition) is clear, but escalation is minimal: Elias faces no meaningful obstacle, reversal, or forced trade-off. The wrecking ball's arrival provides declared urgency ("imminent," "trembled," "groaning") yet he completes the work unhindered and walks away unscathed. Agency is descriptive (he "adjusted," "positioned," "assembled") rather than decisional—no live choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. The ending asserts freedom and purpose without on-page cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—earning respect through discovery—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or trade-off. The hopscotch-starling epiphany deepens understanding but does not narrow options or force a visible sacrifice. Escalation reads as accumulation of insight rather than a tightening choice under the inferred Accumulative lens. The final beat promises future consequence ("redraw every map") without on-page cost or a live decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"learn the rhythm of repair"—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle or tightening choice. She works "quickly, her movements precise," yet no beat shows a misstep, a competing demand, or a visible price paid for success. The mirrors shatter and reform, but these are environmental flourishes rather than escalation driven by protagonist agency. The piece offers atmospheric intensification (groaning library, kaleidoscope of images) in place of a causal turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (restore atmospheric balance) is declared late (final third) and never pressures an on-page choice. The discovery sequence is tourism: each chalk message → cave → artifact, with no reversal or narrowing. Kael's suggestion to reexamine logs and the community's cooperative garden-tending are frictionless; no competing goods, no visible loss of time or resource. The ghost's "waiting for you to become family" criterion is a told gate, not a dramatized test with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving humanity's meaning—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The adjuster faces no dilemma; he was "instructed to delay" but chooses to "vouchsafe something more" without visible friction or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows his options. The mechanism "slows, and then stops" without resistance, rendering the climax a fulfillment rather than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—save the traveler before frost and birds kill them—is signaled early and sustained. The blueprint assembly, bird misdirection, and blue-thread guidance create one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Agency is present but not tested by competing goods or escalating tradeoffs; Tomas executes his plan without adaptation or visible cost. The traveler's survival feels inevitable rather than earned through sacrifice or renunciation, and the orchard's "approval" deflates tension instead of charging consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—helping Marco while respecting patent restrictions—is signaled early and remains coherent. The insight at the ravine provides one meaningful tightening by offering a third path between two apparent options. However, escalation is minimal: Elena faces no on-page obstacles to creating the variant polymer, no corporate pushback, no technical failures. The resolution arrives through inspiration rather than tested commitment, and Marco's grateful smile represents closure without visible cost—we don't see Elena's relationship with her employer, the risk to her career, or the difficulty of the synthesis work.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's pursuit "to find the place where stories begin"—is declared early but never tested or advanced on the page; the story acknowledges he is "no closer" without dramatizing friction between that desire and his actual role. The two customer transactions are identical loops: no reversal, no tightening, no cost that narrows options. Agency is passive observation; Elias performs a service twice with no trade-off, sacrifice, or choice that forecloses a path. The ending restates the opening situation ("his clean slate ready for the next customer") without escalation, and coincidence (customers arriving) drives all movement.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—escape unbearable memory through subsumption—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, the escalation consists of a single linear sequence: fortress → tidal pool → pavilion → absorption → return, with no on-page reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options mid-journey. The rain creates access, but luck (not protagonist choice) opens the path; Kael's agency is decision to descend, not a trade-off or sacrifice that alters tactics. At closure, the relief is granted without a visible price—"emotional contagion…had lessened," but no capability, relationship, or future option is demonstrably foreclosed on the page. The lens is Causal, but the tightening required for ≥8.0 (a live option foreclosed or a trade-off forced) does not appear.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating the grain elevator communication network—is signaled early but never tightened or tested on the page. No reversal or deepening choice narrows options; the broadcast proceeds as planned with summarized success. Farmers respond, but their signals arrive off-stage without complication or cost to Elara's tactics. The resolution is told ("fifteen new cooperative agreements") rather than earned through a protagonist decision that forecloses a path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.1)
    The dominant stake—excavating abandoned dreams—is declared but never dramatized as under threat. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal friction appears; the neural interface works perfectly, the visions arrive on cue, and Elara's method succeeds without complication. The text summarizes her years of research and gradual expansion but shows no on-page reversal, tightening, or cost. "Quaking reverie" is mentioned twice but never embodied as a risk or price. Agency is absent: she is a passive receiver of visions, not a protagonist whose decisions foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake ("to find where forgotten combinations hide") is signaled early and pursued linearly without meaningful resistance. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; each step—reading doodle, traveling to grotto, entering at inversion, retrieving crystals—succeeds as planned. The manuscript describes "terrified detail" about the threshold but Elara experiences no fear, injury, or trade-off. Closure awards complete success with no visible cost: she integrates the combinations, contains them safely, and walks home planning future work. Escalation is declarative (unwonted intensity, latent blaze) rather than dramatized through narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("to create music in a silent world") is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Eliara's first attempt succeeds without complication, cost, or reversal; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off emerges. The sculpture "trembles" and releases sound immediately upon contact, collapsing potential escalation into wish-fulfillment. The lack of meaningful resistance or consequence keeps this narrative inert under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the difficult"—is declared but never tested by a concrete choice or reversal. Elias stands, meditates, and departs with no on-page tightening that narrows options or raises cost. The "eclipsed covenant" and expulsion are backstory summary, not present conflict. No turn or deepening occurs; pressure remains flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (unlock the diary to revisit thoughts on empathy) is signaled early and remains stable. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clasp "shuddered microscopically," but this moment lacks agency—it's a mechanical response, not a choice by Silen that narrows options or raises cost. The fireworks provide a ticking clock, yet their ignition doesn't alter Silen's tactics or force a trade-off. The resolution arrives through correct frequency selection without visible price; no live option is foreclosed, no felt consequence lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity through tending the corpse flower—is signaled early and sustained across the montage. Yet escalation operates through time-passage summary rather than on-page reversals or tightening choices; Elara faces no meaningful resistance, resource constraint, or competing pressure that forces a trade-off. The bloom arrives as hoped, and the realization follows without visible cost or foreclosed path. Under an Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification would suffice, but the closure moment articulates theme rather than narrowing options, leaving pressure diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering the orchard's resilience source—is signaled early and pursued through navigation, extraction, and core investigation. One on-page tightening occurs when the arrow tip's energy surge forces Kael to follow water flows to the convergence point, narrowing her tactical options. However, no live trade-off or visible loss alters her approach; the "fragile equilibrium" is mentioned but never tested by a choice that risks failure. The ending declares the orchard's vulnerability without dramatizing a cost Kael pays or forecloses, leaving escalation conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—explaining the silencing phenomenon—is signaled early, but pressure remains diagnostic rather than escalating. Elias encounters no reversals or trade-offs; each measurement confirms his hypothesis in a straight causal chain. The discovery of the flight fuel additive and dispersal mechanism arrives without complication or cost to him. The piece presents detection without agency: Elias documents but does not choose, endure, or renounce. The final image gestures toward "warnings" and "reckoning" but deflects from his stake to abstract future consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder through song—is signaled early. However, no opposition, constraint, or reversal materializes; the protagonist encounters no friction, error, or cost. The performance unfolds as planned: sing, amber sheet flares, ice responds, task complete. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates. The Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break to reweight the stake, but the final singing-back is a reward, not a trade-off. No live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by setback.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding past failure to reshape guardianship—is clear from the opening. The decision to uncase the flute constitutes one meaningful turn ("to uncase the flute now was to risk everything"), and the passage into the other realm deepens pressure by forcing the Keeper to confront the terrain of mistakes. However, the resolution arrives through observation and epiphany in the other realm, not through a protagonist choice under live pressure. The cost ("burden begin to shift, to transform") is summarized rather than dramatized as a visible forfeiture or tactical price. The piece tightens once but does not escalate through conflicting options or a trade-off that forecloses a path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding emotion mathematically—is signaled early but never tested by a foregrounding choice with visible cost. Silas's agency dissolves when the press operates "of its own accord" and others arrive without his summons, making coincidence resolve rather than complicate. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the ending grants expanded consciousness without trade-off. Escalation is ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—carrying forward the mentor's legacy and mastering wonder-weaving—is signaled early and persists throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs: the hermit encounter extends the courier's understanding of "germinating ideas across generations." Yet escalation relies on reception (listening, realizing) rather than protagonist agency that narrows options or forces trade-offs. The storm and hermit arrival read as coincidental complications, not reversals earned by the courier's prior choices. No on-page cost is visible—the courier gains insight without forfeiting an alternative or enduring a visible price. Pressure accumulates thematically but does not tighten causally or force a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates texturally (vibrations, shifted hush, impressions) but lacks a clear on-page reversal or tightening that forecloses an option. The climax (opening his eyes, touching the hood) confirms rather than tests his conviction; no trade-off or visible cost alters his tactics. The "motivation fulfilled not with data he could show another" sidesteps external consequence, leaving escalation present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—carry a message to her brother—is declared early but never faces an on-page test that forces Elara to choose between competing options or pay a visible price. The story loops through weaving → collapse → rising without escalation: each cycle restates effort but does not narrow possibilities or raise cost. The jigsaw edges and amber bead glow and pulse, but these are effects, not obstacles or trade-offs. No reversal or tightening choice alters her tactics; the "message" is complete in one uninterrupted attempt with no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake: restore the fallen arches to defy collective forgetting. The stake is declared early but pressure remains flat—no on-page obstacle complicates the ritual, no resource shortage, no risk that the silk will fail or exact an unbearable price. The transformation unfolds in a single summarized sequence ("hours passed"); no reversal or tightening narrows options. Elias's agency (decision to restore, execution of the ritual) drives the arc, but the closure delivers triumph without a visible trade-off: he plans "more arches to restore, more magician's silk to acquire" with no hint of what he has sacrificed or what future cost looms. The piece lacks a moment where want conflicts with cost, where a live choice forces a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (discover withheld truth) is signaled early. One tightening: shard activates → Kael jumps realities → nudges probability to expose the log. However, escalation is thin—no on-page opposition, no failed attempt, no visible trade-off between competing goods. The "tiny push to send the incriminating security log" lacks friction; probability nudging is described as effortless ("focused thought") with no cost until the shard heats (exit cue, not a choice-driven price). The log's resurfacing is told in summary; Kael does not act on it within the window, so the tightening does not foreclose a live option or force a final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—relighting the lamp to restore safety—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition; Jonah simply works to relight it and succeeds without dramatized cost or a trade-off that narrows options. The anonymous letters provide thematic texture but don't create on-page pressure that forces a difficult choice. The final stone-stacking is a gesture of acknowledgment rather than a decision under duress. No reversal or tightening choice appears; the piece drifts from observation to symbolic action without a moment where agency forecloses a live path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is declared early but never faces a live on-page test. No escalation occurs: Kaelen adjusts the wick "for the thousandth year," tonight proceeds "as usual," and the ending affirms continuation without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The "accidentally prophetic" headlines appear but generate no complication, adaptation, or cost; coincidence (starlight alignment) produces the effect without protagonist agency. One micro-mention of "tweaking shadows to add nuance" gestures toward choice but remains summary-only, lacking visible consequence that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (learning why some magnetize stories) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual. The prism-light alignment provides one meaningful deepening that narrows understanding from "question" to "purpose." The cost is conceptual—replacing detective urgency with devotional practice—and legible in the final paragraph's shift. Band guardrail met (7.0+): the tightening forecloses the search-driven option. Does not reach 8.8: the felt price is oblique; no visible trade-off dramatized on the page beyond interior reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (discovering what trees witness) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through months of dream-mapping, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options with visible cost. The storm-tower sequence offers atmospheric intensity without forcing a trade-off; the sextant "pulses with ethereal light" and reveals the answer without Elian risking or sacrificing anything tangible. Coincidence (moonlight breaking through clouds, weighted release mechanism heard below) complicates timing but does not test commitment. The resolution is observational epiphany, not protagonist agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm through forgotten songs—is signaled in the opening and sustained throughout. Escalation occurs when the keeper moves from tracing glass to playing the lute to singing aloud, each step releasing more light, but the progression feels additive rather than a narrowing of options or a forced trade-off. The mention of a prior failure that shattered like glass adds stakes retroactively but is told in summary; no on-page reversal tests the keeper's commitment or reveals a visible cost. The townsfolk's awakening arrives as a result of the keeper's persistence rather than a choice with foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to attend the Convergence and face emotional overwhelm—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. Elara's hide ritual and lamp-extinguishing are preparatory actions without opposing pressure or visible trade-off; no event or realization narrows her options or raises cost before she decides. The ending reframes isolation as strength, but this is asserted thematically rather than tested through on-page conflict. Agency is present (she chooses to go) but the choice feels foregone, with no live option foreclosed or price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to find the sacred in the ordinary"—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure does not escalate meaningfully. Elara plants seeds, the baker appears, they share bread, and the story closes on hope; no reversal or tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The baker's uncloaking is a coincidence that delivers information rather than a choice-driven turn. The ending asserts transformation ("the ordinary glowed now, sacred and whole") without demonstrating on-page cost or a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing vow frequencies before the Great Forgetting—is signaled early. Yet Elara faces no reversal, complication, or meaningful tightening; each vow is measured successfully in sequence. The urgency is declared ("more urgent," "window narrowing") but never dramatized through a failed attempt, forced trade-off, or cost that alters tactics. No on-page price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—protect the community from Silas's betrayal—is signaled early and drives the three attempts. However, escalation reads as repetition rather than tightening: each failure (shadow seen, recognized by guard, diversion) doesn't visibly narrow options or raise cost until the final success. The "sunrise" deadline is mentioned but never dramatized as a live constraint altering tactics on the page. Agency is present (Emmie's choices drive the plot), but the resolution—capturing the recording and deciding to preserve the truce—arrives through assertion rather than a visible trade-off or felt price in the final image. The story tells us the stakes are high but doesn't show them compounding.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking answers about weather-carriers—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs; she walks, the compass warms, she finds him, and the discovery resolves her search without friction or cost. The convergence is handed to her by device and coincidence rather than driven by protagonist agency. No trade-off or forfeiture alters her options at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed creativity—is signaled early but never genuinely tested by competing wants or costs. The protagonist retrieves the charcoal and immediately sketches; no on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The "laughter" that mocked his gift is backstory summary, and its resolution is told rather than dramatized. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost, but the final act is a straightforward fulfillment of intent with no visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled in the opening third and drives the treasure-map piecing and hub exploration. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marius's complicity is revealed, narrowing Elara's trust and forcing her to act alone (or with him as ally under new terms). However, the message distribution itself encounters no visible obstacles or costs; we're told it happens and communities respond, but no on-page resistance tests her commitment. The wilting provides a recurring pressure mechanism, but it functions more as atmosphere than a tactical constraint that alters her moves at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled early ("preserve the color of wonder"), but it remains abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or choice-cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the tuner executes his plan without complication, and the fragment melts on cue. Agency is observation and arrangement rather than decision under pressure. The resolution is declared ("his purpose fulfilled") without visible trade-off or forfeited path. Under the chosen lens, pressure does not escalate; the arc is a static demonstration, not a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—resolving inner static and escaping captivity—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when L-734 decides to miniaturize and contain the fears rather than destroy them outright, narrowing options. However, the plan unfolds without visible obstacles or costs that force trade-offs; the controlled burn "began not as explosion but as whisper" and succeeds as intended. No credible loss (stamina, tool failure, partial destruction) alters later tactics, and the protagonist's agency at closure feels more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking Mrs. Leclair's mystery—proceeds via scavenger hunt with no narrowing options or visible trade-offs. Each clue (baker's tune, gardener's elm mention, librarian's archive key) arrives as cooperative gift, not obstacle. The climax (reading the bundle, gathering neighbors) is passive receipt of information and a ceremonial distribution. No tightening or deepening occurs; Elias's path widens with each convenient discovery. The stated motivation ("listening heals") never faces an on-page test where listening costs him time, safety, or social standing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—free the mentor before the lab self-destructs—is signaled early and the countdown provides external pressure. However, the guards watch "mesmerized" rather than forcing a tactical trade-off, and the dice roll exactly the needed sequence, removing genuine escalation. One tightening exists (guards arrive, timer nears completion) but the resolution lacks visible cost; Elara escapes with no loss dramatized on the page. Coincidence solves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or escalating cost. Elara's journey from noticing coffee-ground patterns to performing the ritual proceeds without reversal, failure, or trade-off; gravity pockets and the chamber cooperate rather than resist. The "method had come to her in a dream" bypasses earned discovery, and the seventeen-memory retrieval happens off-page in summary, deflating the climactic beat. No live choice narrows options or forces renunciation; the wildflowers "fulfill their purpose" without dramatized consequence, leaving pressure abstract and stakes uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is declared early but never tested on the page with a visible tradeoff or narrowing of options. The summoner's will "flows through" the wing without resistance, cost, or escalation; the prophecy simply yields. No reversal or deepening occurs; the arc is smooth assertion of mastery. Agency is present but the cost remains conceptual and off-page, failing to foreclose a path with felt consequence scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (keeping the secret vs. sharing it) is clear, but pressure plateaus rather than escalates—Elias asks, she deflects, he asks again, she tells. The revelation moment lacks genuine risk; Elias's response is immediate acceptance with no complication. The "agreed upon lies" dissolve without dramatized cost, and the building's voice conveniently demonstrates her claim rather than testing her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—integrating quarantined memories—is signaled early, but pressure remains flat. Elena's ritual proceeds without reversal, miscalculation, or cost until the very end. The seashell's escalating clarity (whispers → sentences → instruction) is accumulative rather than conflictual; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by resistance. The final walk-through is told as summary ("each step…another fragment") rather than a dramatized choice with visible trade-off. Cost is asserted ("the quarantine was broken") but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (revenge via forgery) and the work escalates from preparation to execution. The tightening occurs when Elara adds her own blood to the seal, but this choice lacks a visible trade-off—no moment where she must sacrifice safety, certainty, or another value to complete the act. The story opts for lyric confidence ("calibrated treason was complete") over dramatized friction. No antagonist pressure tests her resolve on the page; the actual delivery and Lord Valerius's response remain off-stage, so the peak choice feels rehearsed rather than under live fire.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (expose the Chancellor's cover-up and warn the city) is signaled early and pressured through Kaelen's singing, which successfully triggers the Spire's tremor and the city's panic. However, escalation is delivered through accumulation (gathering echoes, weaving engineers' voices) rather than a choice that narrows options or trades off a live path. The resolution occurs off-stage (the city's awakening) without a visible cost to Kaelen himself—he observes the outcome but does not forfeit or endure something on the page. One meaningful tightening is present (the ground shudders, confirming his warning), but the felt price is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—exposing the truth behind the *Northern Star*'s sinking—is signaled early and drives the sequence: dreams grow frantic, Nikolaus reveals negligence, Elara plants the truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when Nikolaus shows the compromised hull, narrowing Elara's options to direct intervention. Yet the peak choice (implanting truth in the director's dreams) happens off-stage between paragraphs ("that night, Elara exposed the truth"), and the director's investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, displacing agency. Cost is told ("exhausted") but not shown altering tactics or forecloseging a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and sustained. The journey tightens as fireflies "intensify" and "acknowledge her presence," then lead her to the loom revelation. However, escalation is largely atmospheric; no live option is narrowed or trade-off forced. The fireflies cooperate rather than resist, and Elara's discovery costs her nothing on the page—no stamina loss, no social risk, no renunciation. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing or understanding the orchard's anomaly—is signaled early, but pressure remains declarative rather than escalating through on-page reversals. Maya's two weeks of study compress into summary, and the letter reconstruction (the one extended beat) deepens knowledge without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The final "decision" to write a different report is stated after the fact with no visible cost: no client confrontation, no professional risk dramatized, no moment where she chooses truth over income. Agency exists but the renunciation that should foreclose a path happens off-page, leaving the stakes abstract at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's divided loyalty—is signaled early and tightens when he must choose between the old astronomers and Maren's movement. The act of altering radio frequencies constitutes one meaningful pressure point that narrows options: he intervenes to redirect prophecy. However, the escalation feels cerebral and off-stage; the decisive action is summarized ("Elias had subtly altered the frequencies") rather than dramatized with visible struggle or tradeoffs. The consequences are muted: Maren's followers "mysteriously dispersed" without on-page reaction, and Elias's descent feels pre-determined rather than forged under fire. The final stance crystallization ("not with the old astronomers... nor with Maren... but with the storm itself") arrives as declaration rather than earned choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving beauty against time's erosion—is signaled early but never faces meaningful resistance. Silas's project expands without friction or trade-off; tourists and the elderly woman arrive conveniently to validate his work. The music box discovery is the sole pressure point, yet it catalyzes immediate purpose rather than a choice with visible cost. Accumulative deepening occurs, but no on-page renunciation or foreclosed path makes the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—protecting the artifact from "discordant hum of human greed"—is signaled early but never materializes as on-page opposition. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the engineer performs the ritual, it succeeds, he returns. The "shift in his bones" and transformation of the marina are asserted outcomes rather than pressure points that test commitment or force trade-offs. Agency is execution, not decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake (redistribute patience) is signaled early, but escalation is summary-driven: "three lunar cycles" compress without meaningful tightening or reversal on the page. No live opposition forces Elara to adapt tactics; the "complete pattern" arrives without cost or trade-off. The closure move—"the delicate process of connection"—is told rather than dramatized, and the resulting "wave of patience" does not show a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.1)
    A dominant stake (investigating the transit worker's death, breaking free from past control) is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options or imposes cost. The inscription "They walk among us" triggers adrenaline but no consequent action or price. The protagonist's agency at closure is walking forward, metaphorically reclaiming her story—told rather than shown through forfeiture or renunciation. No reversal or tightening choice that foreclosed a live option with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (prevent desecration of Eleanor's memory) is signaled early and tightens when Anja reveals the trap. The reversal—apology becomes weapon—narrows options with clear agency: Elias must choose disarmament. The one-hour countdown and photosensitive mechanism add tactical pressure. The cost is legible: Elias's trust was exploited, and he must act to prevent complicity. One meaningful escalation under causal lens is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (ring the Silent Bell) is clear from paragraph one. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kaleidoscope reveals the bell's location and the arrow's harmonic key, narrowing Zephyr's path from diffuse exploration to focused descent. However, no on-page reversal tests commitment—Zephyr encounters no obstacle, cost, or friction that forces a trade-off. The overseer's awe is observational, not oppositional. Agency is present (Zephyr chooses to examine the arrow, to descend) but the escalation curve flattens into a smooth glide toward an off-page culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the Daedalus deletion—is signaled early and drives the investigation forward through escalating discoveries (2319 → patch → Thorne → song). The tightening occurs when Elias discovers the song's power and chooses to broadcast, but this turn lacks on-page opposition or a trade-off that forecloses a live option; no executive confronts him, no system locks him out, no personal cost (job, safety, relationship) is dramatized. The escalation is causal and clear, yet the final act reads as unobstructed agency rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—answering the Council's question to maintain equilibrium—is signaled early but never narrows options or raises cost on the page. The three-mirror sequence unfolds as procedural escalation (Venice chapel, melted ice artifacts, child's decision) without reversal, resistance, or a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The reconstitution succeeds because Shael intuitively finds "the missing empathy," a coincidental discovery rather than a trade-off driven by protagonist agency with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Arthur's search for "the sound of approaching endings," signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through immersion in wreckage, handling the parasol tip, and observing the community's weariness until the shanty moment reweights his understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman sings—a beat that transforms his quest from seeking finality to recognizing endurance. The escalation is textural rather than causal; Arthur's agency is observational and reflective, not decision-driven, so the tightening relies on interpretive realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The cost is conceptual (his quest inverted) but the price to Arthur personally remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—helping the couple rediscover what they lost—never materializes as on-page pressure because we don't witness what "they had nearly lost" or see them resist reconciliation. The sentinel faces no opposition; the letter lands, Lila reads, Marc softens, hands touch—a sequence without escalation or trade-off. The "destined mismatches" theme is declared but not tested. No visible cost accompanies the resolution; the couple's reconciliation feels granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—preserve wisdom before the sands erase it—is signaled early and remains constant. The single tightening moment occurs when the echo voice says "Preserve not just the words, but the truth within them," prompting a second consecration that includes silence. This is a deepening rather than a narrowing of options, consistent with an Accumulative lens, but it lacks visible cost: the parapet has energy reserves, the walker's effort is not shown to exact a price, and he departs "at peace." Agency reads as attention and endurance, but no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—creating a masterpiece from pain—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. Elias's workflow proceeds smoothly: he selects photos, photographs arcs, layers them, and succeeds without setback, sacrifice, or forced trade-off. The "unfamiliar urgency" in the air is declared but not dramatized through obstacles or narrowing options. The final "shift" is a validation, not a turn that forecloses a path or exacts a cost; no live option is eliminated, no tactical adjustment required.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: decode the pattern of language's death. The crystal experiment provides one meaningful deepening (from hypothesis to understanding via "Growth" and "Silence"). However, the scholar faces no genuine opposition or trade-off; the crystal delivers answers without resistance or cost to his method. Agency at closure is passive reception ("letting the sounds wash over him") rather than a choice that forecloses paths. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient, but visible price is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—locating and capturing the sound of aging—is signaled early and drives Elias's ritual. The piece offers one tightening: arranging fragments → reaching the monolith → feeling the vibration → drawing. Yet the escalation is linear rather than narrowing options or raising cost; each step succeeds without opposition or trade-off. The final act (drawing with chalk) feels like ritual fulfillment rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses a path. No reversal, no visible price paid, no option eliminated—just completion. Under the Accumulative lens, a deepening that changes knowledge or stakes is needed; here the vibration confirms what Elias already sought without reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (survival before station disintegrates) is signaled early and tremors escalate viscerally. However, the resolution bypasses protagonist agency: Kael's leaf-listening produces station stabilization via unexplained mechanism, making the "win" a deus ex machina rather than an earned narrowing of options. No visible cost alters his tactics—he simply succeeds. The hand stopping "frozen at the zenith" declares victory without showing what was traded or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—completing Mr. Hale's unfinished arrangement—is signaled early. Escalation is minimal: Elijah arrives, learns the backstory, plays, and places the shard without resistance or trade-off. The nurse's cryptic "skip the usual melodies" sets up tension that dissipates immediately. No live option is foreclosed; the "flawless goodbye" is delivered without agency or cost, leaving pressure static rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"to find where shadows go at noon"—is signaled early and drives the narrative. Pressure escalates when the shadow entity appears and threatens, forcing Elara to act. However, the resolution hinges on a single move (forcing the final rune into alignment) without visible trade-offs or failed attempts; no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost. The shadows' reveal (they hide in world seams, exiled by noon sun) answers the mystery, but Elara's agency at closure is reactive—she completes the mechanism rather than choosing between competing goods. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will surrender the tooth and accept the invitation into the Fae world—is signaled early and tightens when the child explains the anchor is shifting. The exchange itself (tooth for understanding) constitutes a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, with Eleanor foreclosing her prior anchored certainty. Visible cost: she loses the physical talisman that had been "her first encounter." The substitute body functions as inciting pressure, though its resolution happens off-stage (the child explains rather than Eleanor discovering through action).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake signaled: fulfill a promise to share starlight without fire. No on-page reversal, complication, or trade-off tests this commitment. Elara arrives with a mastered method, executes it without friction, and departs satisfied. The "promise made to the sky itself" is told rather than dramatized, and no live option is foreclosed at closure. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; here the texture remains static throughout, and the final act delivers satisfaction without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking refuge from viral judgment—is signaled early but never faces on-page pressure. Maya's arrival could complicate the sanctuary, but instead immediately validates it through shared experience. No meaningful tightening occurs; the confession's consequences remain off-page context, and the encounter with Maya provides comfort rather than forcing a choice between isolation and exposure. The ending's "new code" and "pathways for future growth" gesture toward change without demonstrating what Elara has forfeited or risked to achieve this expanded sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—overcoming writer's block by gathering hopes—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, each collection repeats the same pattern (figure appears, he acknowledges, hope solidifies) without escalation or complication; no figure resists, fades prematurely, or demands a price that alters his approach. The resolution grants him exactly what he sought with no visible trade-off, loss of alternative path, or on-page cost at closure. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the repetitive middle and cost-free ending keep this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (restore sacred practices) is signaled early and remains consistent, but escalation is weak. Elias encounters no on-page obstacle or reversal; each action (humming, adjusting a gear, placing the cricket) succeeds without complication. The cricket's compliance and vine's bloom arrive without a tightening choice or trade-off that narrows options. The "gathering hush" deepens atmospherically but does not impose time pressure or a live cost. Agency collapses to execution of a foregone plan rather than decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing starlight into a heartbeat-map before the celestial window closes—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page obstacle tests Kaelen's commitment; the method works as planned ("The method was working"), eliminating tension. The world "holding its breath" introduces a timeframe, yet no ticking pressure or competing demand narrows options. One micro-tightening occurs when starlight spreads and rearranges, but no reversal or visible cost (stamina, failed attempt, material loss) alters tactics. Agency reads as execution of a rehearsed ritual rather than a choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against cultural forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks escalation or meaningful pressure. Elian faces no opposition, setback, or complication; the repair proceeds smoothly, the test succeeds immediately, and the harvest is "secured" without cost. The "wounded season" and impending scarcity create atmospheric stakes but never materialize as on-page obstacles. No choice narrows options or forecloses a path; the ending fulfills the plan exactly as conceived.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transformation to collect burdens—is signaled early but unfolds without reversal, tightening, or trade-off. The calcification proceeds as scripted ritual; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost (permanent stasis) is told rather than felt. The burdens manifest as catalog (child's fear, old woman's loneliness, nation's guilt) without pressure on Elara's agency. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist choice narrow options or raise price.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—harvesting lessons from loss through carving—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara moves from shaping wood to recognizing Tomas emerging in "the way he carried himself," forcing confrontation with absence made present. The kettle's whistle creates a measured pressure point. However, escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than a choice that narrows options with visible tradeoff. The resolution (completed carving) feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with cost more conceptual than dramatized in a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—escaping the lagoon's hold—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through symbolic accumulation (collecting fragments, confronting the ghost), fitting the Accumulative lens. Yet no on-page reversal narrows options with felt cost: Elias's walk toward the horizon unfolds without resistance or forfeiture. The ghost "lingering but fainter" and regret "no longer defining him" are declared shifts rather than earned through visible trade-offs, leaving escalation abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—to "resurrect something" and "puzzle out new equations for hope"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the valve resists then opens, releasing water; this reversal alters tactics (she redirects the flow through channels). However, the resolution costs Elara nothing on the page: the water flows, the patterns resolve, and she slips the sextant into her pocket without forfeiting an alternative or paying a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it plateaus after the valve turn. No competing option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian places his hand on the crystal and hums, narrowing his stance from avoidance to acknowledgment. However, the shift lacks visible opposition or trade-off; the sanctuary's silence never tests his choice with social or material cost. Pressure accumulates texturally but the final act (returning to work with a smile) does not foreclose a live option or show a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: understanding how the lie was built, not finding treasure. Pressure tightens through the physical salvage sequence (lowering hook, working corroded lock) to the conceptual reversal when plates reveal the engineer's failed scheme. Agency is protagonist-driven: months of preparation, instinct-honed choice, patient extraction. The cost is visible—his life's work redefined—and the final realization forecloses his former identity as treasure hunter. One strong tightening when the chest opens and expectation inverts, though the resolution leans slightly toward explained insight rather than purely enacted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—prove worth to the weavers and access their knowledge—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, Elias faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off: he decodes three knots, holds up the glass, and the weaver immediately accepts him. The fulgurite flares, the rope "weaves itself," and knowledge is granted without cost or complication. The piece offers mood and accumulation but no tightening choice that narrows options or forces a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, a single intensification would suffice, but the transfer of knowledge is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding healing through the gardener's story—is signaled early but never escalates or encounters resistance. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias gathers material and writes without friction, delay, or cost. The gardener's absence (his wife's departure, his choice to stay) is recounted rather than dramatized, and Elias's own loneliness is declared rather than tested. The accumulative lens allows for deepening without causal turns, but here no deepening occurs—only recapitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty versus mechanical survival—is signaled in the opening paragraph. The middle assembles the device, but this beat unfolds without visible resistance, failure, or adaptation; Kael's actions proceed smoothly from coil to prism to thread. The ending provides one reversal (palace collapses) and a cost (Kael's death), but both are summarized in lyric retrospect rather than tested on the page. Under the Causal lens, escalation would require a complication that forces Kael to adapt tactics; under Accumulative, a deepening that reweights prior material; neither fully lands before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing through acts of rebirth—is signaled early. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not tighten or escalate; the planting unfolds without opposition or cost. The coin-tying ritual offers one modest deepening, yet no reversal or trade-off narrows options. Agency is present (Elara plants, ties the thread) but feels symbolic rather than forced by conflict, and the ending restates rather than transforms the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens. Kael encounters breadcrumbs in sequence, each yielding information without complication or reversal; there is no moment when an option narrows or a choice forces a trade-off. The box's opening is triggered by the discovery of the key and the memory of his grandmother's words, not by Kael's agency or renunciation. Coincidence (the key tangled in the sapling's roots) resolves the puzzle, and the ending distributes pure reward—no cost, no foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (breaking the cycle vs. preserving organic harmony) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the gear is placed and light is shared, but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency—events happen to the sentimentalist more than resulting from its decisions. The "gear began to glow" and "garden responded" without clear cost; the sentimentalist's "serenity now troubling" is asserted emotion rather than a demonstrated trade-off that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains meditative rather than escalating through choice or opposition. The carving of the migration path in the final third offers one meaningful deepening, consistent with Accumulative design. Yet no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized; Elias encounters no friction between competing goods or unavoidable harms. The cost at closure is conceptual and asserted, not felt on the page, capping the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring the shared balance he disrupted—is signaled early and sustained. The pendulum's pause functions as a pressure threshold, and Elias's penance ritual tightens as he aligns the rake handle at the moment of stillness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendulum resumes "with a newfound depth," reweighting his burden. However, the ritual succeeds without visible friction or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, and the escalation feels assured rather than tested by agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear (prevent echo-systems from deteriorating), and one tightening occurs when Elias isolates Foster's thread. Yet escalation is muted—no reversals force trade-offs, and the resolution (thread reconstitutes) arrives without visible cost or agency that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's action feels frictionless, lacking the pressure or price that would push this into stronger bands.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake is declared ("to seed innovation within a constraint") but never tested on the page; no antagonist, obstacle, or internal conflict forces a trade-off or tightening of options. The sequence is climb → pause → write → descend, with each step a meditative tableau rather than a beat that narrows possibility or raises cost. The lake's cracking and thawing suggest ambient consequence but lack causal linkage to a protagonist decision; the cartographer's agency is summative description ("he had to prevail") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. No reversal or deepening is legible, and the ending grants pure gain (lighter steps, quiet confidence, legacy in motion) without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reawakening stories after the famine—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the broadcast's elusive signal, the lyric instruction, and the crystal's discovery, leading to the dust animation sequence. However, escalation lacks agency-driven reversals: each step succeeds without credible resistance or trade-off. The climax (singing to animate dust) unfolds as wish-fulfillment; no live option is foreclosed, and the resolution (renewed magic, world reawakened) arrives without visible cost or complication. One tightening occurs when the lyrics coalesce into a map, but it does not narrow options or raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—crystallizing a fleeting emotion before it dissolves—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual steps (unwrapping, powdering, the mask transforming), and one micro turn appears when a shard falls and Elias picks it up. Yet the escalation is processual rather than agonistic: no live dilemma tests Elias's commitment, no reversal narrows options. The ending reconfigures meaning (mirage → truth) with felt cost, but agency remains attenuated—Elias enacts a handed-down method rather than wrestling with a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving counter-narrative truth against state control—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Escalation is largely archaeological (finding cog, then charts) without genuine narrowing of options or felt trade-offs; Sebastian's final choice to emerge as water rises lacks on-page resistance or visible cost. The tremors arrive as external pressure, not protagonist-driven agency, and the "competing narratives gnawed at him" question is posed but not tested in scene. No meaningful tightening occurs: the climax is a physical escape, not a decision that forecloses a path or forces a moral calculus with dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving musical tradition and braiding divided voices—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: the administration's skepticism and ancestral hatred are declared but never test Eleanor on the page with a live constraint or forced trade-off. The rehearsal's "perfect fifths" discovery and final chord function as micro turns, yet the piece moves through teaching beats without narrowing Eleanor's options or imposing visible cost. The resolution (students leaving with "quiet conversations") asserts change rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path, leaving pressure diffuse under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins via the knowledge fruit—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation unfolds through weeks of tending and the plant's growth, but the sequence reads as steady progress without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The pruning paragraph gestures toward choice ("cuts healed instantly") but imposes no visible cost; branches dissolve into light without consequence. The final distribution of seeds completes the plan without on-page friction or trade-off, leaving the closure image declarative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and drives Elias's ascent. The discovery that the log is a poem rather than "technical, cold" constitutes a reversal that reweights his mission. Yet the conflict lacks escalation: no obstacle impedes his climb, the panel is conveniently open, and the riddle solves itself without struggle. The girl's acceptance and the lamp's flicker provide resolution without visible cost or trade-off; Elias loses nothing and gains peace. One meaningful tightening (poem as revelation) is present but agency at closure is minimal—he hands off the burden and departs unburdened.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.9)
    Dominant stake—proving houses are alive—is told in exposition rather than tested by opposition or cost. The displacement ritual proceeds without friction; no reversal or tightening narrows options. Elias's "knowing what must be done" skips the decision beat entirely, and the house's "groaning with pleasure" confirms success without any visible trade-off or price paid. Pressure is declared ("feverish vitality," "cosmic pressure") but never escalates through agency or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: how to respond to new attention after his "eternal, silent vigil" is shattered. The tightening occurs when he perceives the ampoule as invitation rather than probe, narrowing his options from passive preservation to active bridge-building. The chime-strike is protagonist-driven and forecloses isolation with felt cost (vulnerability, noise after absolute silence). Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density and conceptual reweighting rather than causal reversals. One persistent constraint (his telepathy can only broadcast, not converse) shapes his tactic of using the chime.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (escape the loop) is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the proof-writing sequence, and the crumbling steps provide one meaningful tightening. Yet the decisive rupture unfolds without visible trade-off or cost legibility—Elias risks "everything" in abstract terms, but no live option is foreclosed on the page before the stairs dissolve. The final step onto solid ground registers relief more than a hard-won sacrifice, leaving escalation functional but under-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daydream shifts from abstract intention to accessing the old man's specific memory, narrowing the experiment from hope to confirmation. The final act (painting the symbols) reweights her stance from desperate need to "quiet triumph," and the conceptual cost is legible: the leaf will crumble, and the proof is internal, uncheckable by others. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation of atmosphere than protagonist agency under duress; no reversal or forced trade-off tests her commitment. The old man's memory is accessed without resistance, limiting visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving communal memory and identity—is signaled early and sustained. The bread-baking ritual provides one meaningful deepening: private mourning becomes shared communion. Elara's choice to bake the "L" for the fresco attempts to elevate cultural loss to kinship status, but the pressure never tightens into a forced trade-off; she performs the act without visible resistance or cost beyond the conceptual. Under an accumulative lens, the ritual reweights the stake, but agency remains declarative rather than a decision that narrows options. No on-page reversal or constraint forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—stepping beyond fate's design—is signaled early and the yoyo ritual provides one meaningful pressure point. However, the escalation is thin: the clockmaker encounters no resistance, doubt, or trade-off that forces a choice. The cost (dissolution) arrives suddenly rather than being foreshadowed or earned through micro-decisions, and the solution (lift rather than throw) feels revealed rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"trick fear into revealing its weakness"—is signaled early but never operationalized into a concrete on-page test with escalating cost. The protagonist walks toward a mirror and "embraces" it, but this action does not narrow prior options or foreclose a path; instead, the text asserts transformation ("something fundamental shifted") without showing what was risked or lost. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the sequence reads as a series of atmospheric beats ("mirrors surrounded us," "walls reconfigured") that do not raise the price of continuing or force a trade-off. The advisor's urgency ("you must choose the path you'd never take") is delivered as instruction rather than pressure that the protagonist resists or pays to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested on the page. The prophet faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no reversal. The text describes a process (making music) without escalation—each action succeeds smoothly. "Obstacles" are mentioned thematically but none appear on the page to narrow options or force a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understand the watchers and her father's fate—is clear from the opening, and the tightening occurs when Elara decodes the pattern and establishes contact. The final act delivers agency: she plays the whistle sequence, receives confirmation (the salute), and accepts the ongoing role of intermediary. However, escalation is somewhat muted: months of study are compressed into summary, the crack appears conveniently, and the parchment provides answers rather than forcing Elara to risk a harder choice. The cost—she cannot pass through, only communicate—is legible and bittersweet, but it's more acceptance of a revealed truth than a trade-off she wrestles with on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, but the path there lacks friction that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—expose the lie versus preserve fragile peace—is signaled early. The confrontation with the station master offers one reversal (he appears, challenges, then yields), but his capitulation is unearned by prior escalation; he folds after a single metaphor rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Elias's final choice to take the letter carries conceptual weight but no on-page price is dramatized—no alliance broken, no safety forfeited, no immediate consequence that narrows later options.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion before water reclaims it—is signaled early but never tightens into a meaningful choice or foreclosed option. The warning horn and descending drawbridge impose external time pressure, yet Elias completes his ritual without visible trade-off, omission, or altered tactic. No reversal or deepening narrows his options; he executes his plan as intended. The piece accumulates texture but lacks escalation under its own lens, and the "cost" at closure (resuming the "watery vigil") is conceptual, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The discovery that the city was built underwater rather than sunk provides one meaningful tightening of knowledge. Yet Elias faces no antagonist, no competing deadline pressure from the blackout, and no visible trade-off; the investigation proceeds without friction or cost. The escalation is cognitive (hypothesis → evidence → conclusion) but lacks a felt price or foreclosed alternative that would elevate pressure under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—to capture and reassemble Liora's dream—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias moves from general process to the specific challenge of capturing her laughter ("a sound like crystal bells... to visualize it as a color, a frequency, a pattern"), narrowing his focus and raising the emotional cost. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation: each stone he selects, each hour of polishing, each scored fold is a deliberate choice that forecloses rest or acceptance. The cost is legible on the page—"descend into the meticulous, heartrending work"—and the final line makes the price unmistakable: he continues despite knowing it's delusion. No antagonist is required; the situational pressure of irretrievable loss sustains coherent escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping potential energy—is signaled early but remains abstract and declarative. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elias moves from discovering patterns to entering coordinates without a meaningful obstacle or cost that narrows options. The "hunt" is preparation, not pressure, and the ending defers consequence. Agency is missing: the protagonist observes and decides to descend, but no prior choice forecloses a path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the frequency/retrieve missing pieces—is signaled early but never tightened. The energy barrier offers a potential reversal, yet Kai bypasses it by "allowing the frequency of belonging to guide their instincts," which reads as coincidence rather than earned agency. No visible cost narrows options; the drone retrieves everything and Kai feels "recognition—coming home to a place they'd never been before" without foreclosing a live alternative or paying a tactical price.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias can confess the truth about his role in Mara's brother's suicide and whether Mara will accept or reject him. The stake is signaled early and tightens when Mara asks "Ready to talk about it?" Elias's confession—"I can't quell the guilt anymore" and the admission that false memories shield him from his own crime—is a meaningful pressure point that narrows his options. The escalation is driven by his agency (choosing to speak, offering the watch hand, inviting her to the shore). Cost is felt: he risks final rejection and exposes the paradox that his work is both sin and salve. One clear tightening under the Accumulative lens; no need for multiple reversals at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (retrieve Captain Mellor and "begin untethering our nations from their hatred") is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or complication. The exchange proceeds exactly as synchronized with no reversal, friction, or cost-forcing choice. Julian's internal "untethering" from his Zaatari failure is declared at the end but not dramatized through a prior tightening that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation; the moon-phase method and mutual goodwill eliminate tension rather than raise it. No visible price paid after the exchange alters later tactics or future stance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can trust her instruments and calling again—is clear early. Pressure accumulates through her repeated lighthouse attempts, the compass's warmth, and the drift off course. The tightening occurs when she withdraws the compass and reinterprets its needle, narrowing her tactical reliance on utility poles. However, the lighthouse arrival is summarized without an on-page cost or trade-off at that beat; "exhaustion and elation" are told, and the final insight ("not about completing the journey but about reconciling") reweights thematically but does not show a visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to kindle empathy where none remains"—is signaled early but never tested on the page through a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Elias's journey descends through tunnels and finds the pedestal newspaper, yet no reversal or complication forces him to alter tactics; the water passage opens conveniently and the pedestal message appears without obstacle. The final submersion is framed as acceptance rather than agency-driven escalation. No on-page cost is legible: he "let[s] go of the baseball" and feels a "flicker of warmth," but what path is foreclosed or what price paid remains abstract. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that changes knowledge or options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring Shadowpaw—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: Elara lights the spices, transformation begins, Shadowpaw appears; no reversal or tightening narrows her options. The phoenix's rule-change arrives as explanation rather than obstacle, and the ritual succeeds without visible cost (no stamina loss, social price, or forfeited humanity on the page). Agency is present in the decision to perform the ritual but not tested by resistance or trade-off during execution.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and drives the ascent and ritual. The portal opening provides one meaningful tightening, but the resolution unfolds as realization rather than a choice that forecloses options. The cost ("learning to inhabit what remains") is described as future work rather than paid on the page through a visible sacrifice or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension for humanity's continuation—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the shadow work confrontations make Elara heavier, raising the physical cost of persisting. However, the stitching itself proceeds without setback or error; each pass succeeds on first attempt, flattening escalation. The portal stabilizes "with grace," and her decision to stay rather than cross is narrated as memory of a vow, not a live temptation with visible tradeoff. The cost of shadow work (growing heaviness) is embodied but does not narrow her tactical options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled in the opening third but never tested by a live choice that forecloses an alternative path. Pressure does not escalate under any coherent lens: the bottle slip is accidental, the bug's flight is autonomous, and the discovery of the box occurs without visible trade-off or competing want. The "texture of transformation" is handed to Elias by coincidence rather than earned through agency or renunciation. No meaningful tightening occurs; the volcano rumbles but does not threaten, and Elias seals the bottle and departs richer "in understanding" without paying a legible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—protect the fort or join the revolution—is signaled early but never tightens into a meaningful trade-off. Elena deciphers, follows, and descends without facing a single on-page obstacle or cost; the engineers simply explain the plot when she arrives. No reversal or deepening narrows options; coincidental access (the hidden panel, unguarded passage, engineers waiting) replaces protagonist agency. The final "decision" is a summary nod, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (understand sacred patterns to restore friction) is clear and tightens from prior failure to tonight's success. However, the final beat grants success without visible cost: no renunciation, no trade-off, no foreclosed option. The star dust "settling" and equations being transcribed occur passively, and her visions show futures with eels migrating perfectly—reward without price visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—bearing witness and mapping scars—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete on-page consequence tests it. Opening the envelope is framed as defiance, yet no antagonist or cost materializes; the poem's release is emotional summary, not a visible trade-off. The storm and timer supply texture but do not escalate pressure or narrow options. The ending declares purpose without an earned turn or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—turning questions into destinations via philosophical fencing—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Yet the duel proceeds without escalation: Elias positions the needle, Lyra arrives, they exchange arguments, and the sundial's angles shift, but no reversal narrows options or raises cost. The ending declares "understanding" without showing what was risked or lost to achieve it; Lyra's touch and soft line relieve tension rather than crystallize a hard-won stance. Agency reads as observation and verbal sparring, not decision with visible consequence. The lack of a meaningful tightening or deepening under Situational pressure keeps this functional but limited.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving banned knowledge and beauty—is signaled early and accumulates through book sorting, garden planning, and network expansion. However, escalation is additive rather than tightening: each new element (Maya, plants, teenagers, encrypted contacts) broadens the resistance without forcing Elias to forfeit a live option or face a visible cost. The authorities' threat to dismantle the library arrives late and resolves off-page through the contact network, undercutting on-page pressure. Agency remains present but the final act does not narrow options or change knowledge in a way that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rewinding time to fix the clock—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. The pianist encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and pays no price; the arbor and film reel cooperate without resistance. The gears simply turn when he presses the clock, a coincidental resolution that undercuts agency. No reversal or tightening narrows options; pressure remains static from midpoint to end.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (waken the seed before the monsoon) is signaled early and remains coherent. The timeframe tightens expectation, but on-page escalation is thin: Elias lies down, navigates dream symbols, speaks one word, and succeeds. No reversal or deepening forces a visible trade-off; the ritual proceeds without adaptation or error. The monsoon arrives as the story closes, framing urgency retrospectively rather than forcing a mid-scene choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding "the color of unspoken apologies"—is signaled early and accumulates through grandmother's wisdom, compass guidance, and lace tracing. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as Kenji moves from being "threatened to drown" to "carrying" remembrance. The tightening is a cadence shift rather than a choice that narrows options; the compass settles and Kenji nods, but no live alternative is dramatized and foreclosed. The resolution is contemplative acceptance rather than agency-driven escalation with visible trade-off, holding this in the mid-6 range.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency in applying dust patterns, deepening the stake of healing trauma. The cost is felt in her physical strain and the emotional trade-off for Mr. Gable. One meaningful tightening occurs as her actions narrow options toward gradual decay, but the escalation is subtle rather than sharply causal.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the accumulative lens, as he decodes frost patterns and retraces steps, narrowing options and revealing the smuggler's truth. Cost is legible in his realization and the foreclosed path of his former art. Stakes tighten meaningfully from personal purpose to broader thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of overcoming silence escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (persistent experimentation with tuning fork and scanner), leading to a decisive intensification where cost is felt in emotional release. No coincidence; pressure tightens via density increase in thermal patterns and vibrational feedback.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly signaled—giving rest to lost souls—and escalate through Marcus's agency under the Causal lens, from initial curiosity to life-threatening dives. One meaningful tightening occurs when he occupies impossible spaces, forcing a trade-off with personal cost. Cost is legible in his divided existence and the enduring chase for stillness. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (intergenerational support) escalates under Accumulative lens through agency-driven food runs, deepening trust and volunteer involvement. Cost is legible in the effort and emotional impact, e.g., Lena's heart pounding with fear and purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs as youths join, foreclosing isolation. No coincidence or static conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—guiding reality and others’ pain toward “humble grace” without abrupt, chaotic repair—is clear but only lightly pressured. Elara’s choice to work on Mr. Gable is framed as routine extension of her philosophy rather than a fraught decision with alternatives or risk. There is no real escalation of conflict; nothing seriously threatens her method, her secrecy, or her relationship with him. As a result, tension stays low and the piece reads more as a meditative vignette than as a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes are primarily internal (Kaelen’s search for purpose and response to an attempted silencing) braided with an external mystery (the smuggler’s role and the syndicate’s violence). There is one clear deepening turn—discovering the crates and books—that reconfigures his understanding of the attack and shifts his trajectory from fear to testimony. However, on-page tension is relatively gentle: the walk to the mineshaft and the exploration lack immediate jeopardy or hard trade-offs, so escalation reads more contemplative than pressured. The final choice carries moral and emotional stakes, but not strongly contested ones.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can create a new form of music from silence—is clear, but pressure escalates only mildly. “She worked for hours” skips over potential failure or doubt beats, so the experiment’s eventual success feels somewhat inevitable rather than wrested from real resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost souls to rest versus Marcus’s own inability to find stillness—is established early and followed through. Conflict escalates from an apparently unfixable object, to research into forbidden knowledge, to multiple “life-threatening” dives, to the painful, liminal ritual of existing in “impossible spaces.” The cost is credible but somewhat undercut by being mostly summarized (we do not feel a specific dive or failure, only hear about them in aggregate). The internal conflict at the climax is strong conceptually but could use one sharper, on-page moment of hesitation or near-break to fully peak the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—whether intergenerational trust and dignity can be restored under sanctions—is clear, and Elias’s plan introduces a concrete tactic. However, the story mostly tracks implementation and positive effects; there is little on-page resistance or escalation beyond initial fear and skepticism, and no real reversal. Pressure deepens conceptually (from individual baskets to a nascent “economy of warmth”) but not dramatically, so options never feel endangered or traded off under visible cost. As a result, the conflict feels resolved smoothly rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elias meaningfully locate and release “unused love”?—is present, but pressure remains mostly conceptual and gentle. Escalation is an increase in clarity and effect (seeing the sparks, then brightening them via breath and tear) rather than a narrowing of options or a hard trade-off. There is no real opposition or risk beyond mild trembling and uncertainty, so the healing reads as almost frictionless. This keeps tension functional but not gripping at a level expected for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—severing himself from the retrocognitive prison of his wife’s memory—is clear and culminates in a costly, active choice. Pressure escalates from ambient entrapment to a direct confrontation at the maze’s heart, with the garden’s resistance providing externalization of internal stakes. Yet most of that resistance is high-level and inevitable rather than testing alternate options or forcing complex trade-offs in scene. The conflict works, but lacks one sharper, concrete reversal or dilemma that would lift it into truly gripping territory.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving seeds for a ruined world—is clearly signaled and tied tightly to the immediate risk of death under a collapsing building. Pressure escalates from constrained problem-solving to genuine peril when he misjudges the last note, forcing a desperate reorientation that tests his resolve and ingenuity. The cost is legible: he sacrifices his own survival prospects to secure the vault, with the wall’s fall underlining the irreversible trade-off. Conflict remains mostly external plus a modest internal battle with panic, so the moral calculus is solid but not deeply layered.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and followed through, but conflict is largely internal and low-friction. There’s a single meaningful tightening when the air “thickens with the weight of unspoken goodbyes” and he finally hears the sound, yet there are no serious obstacles or reversals; success feels inevitable. His agency is real (coming here, listening, imprinting, then deciding to share the sound), but never truly contested. The lack of a sharper trade-off or visible price at the peak keeps tension from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—will he access some “destiny” via the portrait or confront his own yearning—is legible and does tighten as the golden light fades and the moonbeams dim. The silence at the canvas and his frustration on his knees form the key pressure point, forcing a reevaluation. However, conflict stays almost entirely internal and low-friction; no strong opposing force beyond disappointment and time pushes him. The renunciation at the end is earned but relatively low-cost and serene, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what kind of piece he will make, and thus how he will embody his idea of a thawing heart—is clear but relatively gentle. Escalation hinges mainly on the internal shift from vase (container) to teardrop (moment of release), which is conceptually strong but not heavily pressured by opposition or risk. The abandonment of the first project is a genuine narrowing of options, yet the price is mostly aesthetic and philosophical. The piece works as quiet conflict, but the tension could be sharpened further for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The core stakes—reclaiming his stolen identity and overcoming crippling claustrophobia—are signaled early and track consistently to the confrontation. There is some escalation as he forces himself to remain in the oppressive library to solve the cast and then face the betrayer, but the antagonistic pressure at the lab is surprisingly soft. The betrayer yields quickly to a confession weaponized via the seashell, making the resolution feel low-cost and under-contested. Internal conflict does deepen, but external conflict never bites hard enough to fully test his new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—completing a meaningful map before the stars go out—is clear, and the “only one star remains” clock does create some urgency. There is a mild escalation as his work shifts from record-keeping to forging a key for a gateway. Yet conflict stays largely internal and low-friction: no real dilemma, no visible sacrifice, and no substantial resistance beyond implied madness risk. As a result, the climax feels more like a serene reveal than a pressured choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—734’s attempt to transcend its janitorial sentence and repair fractured time—emerges clearly, and pressure escalates as playing the violin reveals multiple selves and threatens its consciousness. The key tightening comes when its thoughts begin to dissolve into the music, forcing it to continue at personal risk to achieve integration. However, the conflict stays largely one-directional; there is little sense of a viable alternative path or moral trade-off, so the choice, while costly, feels somewhat inevitable. The tension is strong but could gain from sharper, more conflicted options at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake is emotional: will isolation and mistrust persist, or will honesty risk vulnerability and connection? That pressure is signaled but escalates gently; the registrar’s pulse quickens, he steps out, and conflict dissolves with minimal resistance once he speaks and accepts the ticket. There’s no real reversal or loss beyond a soft risk of breaking custom, so the outcome feels relatively safe and foregone. The story reads more as a mood piece than as a test of competing fears or values.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s belief in the garden’s reciprocal knowledge has any truth in a quantified-luck world—is clear early. Pressure escalates once the garden behaves impossibly and the device glitches, forcing him to choose to engage with the phenomenon and confront its meaning. However, the conflict remains relatively low-intensity: there is little real threat, opposition, or trade-off beyond emotional risk, and no sharp narrowing of options. The ending resolves on validation more than on a costly or conflicted stance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—proving the sideways/branching nature of time—is clear, and the lever sequence offers a formal escalation in intensity and complexity of projections. However, nothing meaningfully opposes Elias: no risk to specimens, no danger from overloading the nexus, and no career or ethical jeopardy on the page. As a result, the tension remains primarily declarative and intellectual; the outcome never feels truly in doubt. The final “turn” is more an information reveal than a pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can resurrect and legitimize Isabella’s lost work—is clear, and the decoding-to-performance progression offers a basic escalation. Yet the external danger of the flood never becomes real pressure, and the decoding itself unfolds without resistance or trade-off. The ghost’s appearance and the receding waters arrive as rewards rather than as outcomes tested against risk. As a result, tension remains modest and the story reads more as revelation than as conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can locate and define the “swallowed truth” about her brother—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening insight: first the physical sensation of weight, then recognizing it as absence, then tying that absence to systemic erasure of her brother’s warning. The decisive “turn” is her smudging and re-reading the margins, which narrows her options emotionally (she can’t cling to the avalanche story anymore) and forces acceptance of the heavier, lonelier burden. However, the conflict remains almost entirely interior and meditative, with limited sense of real risk or competing desires beyond grief versus clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—relieving the weight of his secret—is clear, but it remains largely internal and abstract, with minimal external pressure beyond trespassing ambience. There is a meaningful tightening when he recognizes the wheel as his “pressure valve” and chooses to turn it, yet there’s no articulated risk or real alternative, so the choice feels low-cost. The burden then dissipates cleanly without complication, which undercuts a sense of lasting price or escalation. As a result, tension is present but not especially sharp or deepened in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract: the “weight of accumulating histories” and the need for respite are named but not pushed into real dilemma or loss. The visit to the refuge and subsequent return do not notably narrow options or force a trade-off; they feel like a familiar, low-risk cycle. There is little tangible escalation—the regenerative silence soothes, but nothing threatens to break the keeper, the archive, or their vocation. As a result, the story succeeds as mood but reads under-pressured for elite short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—can Maya connect with a shut-down child during this limited cosmic window—is clearly signaled, and the eclipse plus Leo’s muteness provide a situational constraint. The main tightening comes when Leo taps along, then stands and asks to “link the music to the stars,” which is a strong escalation from internal withdrawal to shared action. However, there are no real setbacks or hard trade-offs; once the music starts working, everything moves steadily toward success. The felt cost is more conceptual (the fragility of such breakthroughs) than dramatized through difficult choices in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is preservation and potential reawakening of human imagination, signaled by Aria’s desire to probe the fragile diaries and understand the displaced axis. Pressure escalates modestly via revelations in the diary and Aria’s interpretive leaps, but the risk to self and archive never becomes an active on-page obstacle or dilemma, keeping conflict largely intellectual. The main turn is informational—recasting dragons as guardians and the axis as metaphysical—rather than a hard narrowing of options or a forced trade-off. The result is absorbing but low-tension; it feels like the first movement of a larger conflict rather than a fully stressed unit.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are notionally high—lives and a covert network—but they remain abstract because nothing on the page meaningfully threatens failure. Elias has no opposition, no time crunch that bites, and no unforeseen variable; every move is a foregone conclusion. The “tide will turn twice…” line hints at peril but never materializes as concrete pressure. As a result, tension stays low and there is no substantive escalation toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing possession/unraveling stillness—is clearly stated and remains in view, with pressure rising as the entity stirs, recoils, snarls, and thrashes. Escalation is present in the thickening loops, sharper rhetorical attacks, and increasingly aggressive responses from the entity. However, the conflict remains mostly abstract; we rarely see concrete, specific costs or irreversible losses beyond fatigue and generalized suffocation. The final stabilization is earned but feels relatively low-priced given the cosmic rhetoric of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—can he complete this fragile, self-imposed ritual before exhaustion and dawn dissolve his access to memory—is coherent and escalates via the ascent and increasingly potent memories. Pressure rises as the spire “listens,” the shell glows, and the horizon begins to pulse, but we rarely feel a sharp narrowing of options or a real risk of failure; the process remains mostly smooth. The cost (utter depletion and loss of the magic) is clear and paid on the page, giving the climax weight. Still, the lack of concrete obstacles or reversals undercuts potential intensity at the inciting and peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—escape/conquering the labyrinth of self versus remaining trapped in endlessly generated timelines—is clear and carries through to the final beat. Pressure escalates via the viaduct’s warping, the flicker and collapse of another Kael, the darkening atmosphere as timelines collide, and finally his leap that breaks the system at personal cost. However, some intermediate moves (retracing steps, runes aligning “just right”) feel like iterations of the same tactic rather than distinct escalations, and the labyrinth’s demand for “a sacrifice” remains more declared than dramatized in concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking through emotional numbness—is clear early and consistently pressures her choices, particularly the decision to deliberately damage the records with a crude needle for maximal sensation. Escalation is primarily internal and sensory rather than event-driven, but it does tighten: from repairing the needle to enduring chaotic, scraping vibrations that risk overwhelming her. The cost lands as partial, painful re-entry into feeling rather than an easy cure. A stronger external counter-pressure or a sharper on-page risk (e.g., destroying a finite resource) could heighten the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—whether Elias stays in insulated integrity or risks engaging with the rogue message—is clear and internally driven. Pressure rises when he opens and reads the note, but after that, the stakes remain somewhat abstract (“the storm is not what you think”) without a tangible escalation or external push. The tail and quarantine alarms set an ominous backdrop but never tighten into an immediate, forcing pressure point. His final resolve is earned but not deeply tested on the page, so the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can face and anatomize the sorrow bound to certain scents—appears early and remains coherent, with a meaningful deepening when the UV reveals not just the flower but his father’s coat/perfume memory. Pressure escalates texturally as the transformation completes and the hidden scent-layer appears, forcing him into an emotional confrontation. However, there’s little resistance or risk of failure: no serious chance the experiment might misfire, or that he might reject the revelation or mishandle the capture. The result is a satisfying but relatively smooth arc of pressure rather than a sharply tested one.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—choosing between a painless perfect timeline and collective ignorance that empowers predatory beings—is strong on its face and clearly signaled. Escalation occurs as he penetrates successive chambers, but the pressure remains more intellectual than visceral, and we don’t see options narrowing in a way that tightens immediate cost. The eventual refusal of the binary via rope-braiding feels clever yet somewhat consequence-light, since no concrete downside of this maneuver is dramatized. As a result, conflict resolves more as a conceptual flourish than a hard-won, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is Lyra’s need to find a way to live with and transform the chronic hush of loss, signaled early via her acoustically perceptive torment. Pressure escalates quietly as she moves from past attempts (playing until her fingers bled) to a new combined ritual of bowl, hum, birdsong, and story that yields a different internal stance. There’s one meaningful deepening when she hears “no longer the hollow silence of loss, but the faint stir of renewal” and chooses to speak a story instead of only playing. Still, conflict remains largely internal and smooth; sharper trade-offs or a more acute moment of doubt could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—profit-driven emotional counterfeiting versus a nascent desire to honor genuine resilience—is clear and sharpened when the dealer realizes “the chemist’s longing wasn’t for tears, but for the courage to feel again.” Pressure escalates internally as their professional habits clash with this realization, culminating in the decision to set the petal down and alter the product. The cost is mostly ethical and conceptual; external stakes or immediate consequences are minimal. The tension is real but remains relatively low-temperature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Marla’s desire to secure recognition for the unseen—is clear but faces almost no resistance, so pressure remains low. Her introduction of Frederick to the conductor happens without friction, and her help to the elderly composer is similarly unopposed; escalation comes more from added coincidences than from tested commitments or trade-offs. There is no moment where she risks status, comfort, or relationship capital to uphold her values. The result is moving but dramatically flat, with stakes that feel conceptual rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding or creating a sign of communal belonging—is clear from early on and tightens at the moment they discover the tag is incomplete. Pressure deepens when the myth seemingly fails and Kael despairs, prompting the crucial choice to act creatively rather than continue the search. Still, there’s little sense of real risk or loss if they fail; the cost is mainly emotional effort, so escalation feels gentle rather than gripping. The resolution is earned but low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve or redeem lost lives/echoes before the giant wakes and erases everything again—is clearly established, and pressure escalates well with the interrupted cadence and ticking end of the nap. Elias’s escalating time-borrowing (minutes → week) is a strong mechanical escalation that narrows his options. The central ethical conflict at the climax (break the loop and shatter existence vs. keep the echoes caged) is present but handled quickly, with limited on-page struggle or concrete sense of what “shattering his existence and the world he knew” entails. As a result, tension is strong but could be more viscerally sharpened at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reframing his grief over Liora’s ambiguous loss—is clear and on-page from early on. Pressure builds in a gentle, accumulative way: the orchard’s silence at moon-zenith, the ritual placement of the eyes, the pulsing and rearranging patterns, culminating in the vision that forces a change in how he relates to absence. The core tension between wanting factual closure and needing emotional integration is present but rarely sharpened into explicit, high-cost alternatives, giving the piece a meditative rather than truly fraught feel. The final renunciation of “solving” the ambiguity is a meaningful deepening, even if the price is rendered more lyrically than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s desire to be selectively “visible” by leaving meaningful traces—is clear but faces minimal friction. The outage and the imminent return of power hint at a ticking clock, yet no concrete risk (discovery, injury, loss of access) manifests on the page. His mission proceeds smoothly, with no true reversal or tough trade-off, so pressure remains gentle rather than tightening. The ending is emotionally satisfying but not hard-won, which keeps conflict and stakes in the competent-but-modest range.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will cling to control or submit to a different mode of knowing—is signaled early and tightens under each storm. The first storm turns his project into a crisis (data and models fail, his improvised shield backfires), and the second forces a decisive renunciation of method. The cost is mostly internal (abandoning his framework and professional vanity) rather than materially dramatized, which keeps the stakes intimate but slightly soft. Still, there is a clear escalation in pressure and a meaningful, earned stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will find a meaning-structure for her insomnia and rain-obsession—is clear and paid off in her acceptance of insomnia as “invitation.” Pressure escalates modestly: first she’s following patterns alone, then confronted with the stranger and the demand for an “exchange,” then confronted with overwhelming communal memory via the vortex. However, conflict remains largely internal and metaphysical, with little friction or risk that might force a more agonized or ambiguous choice; the exchange feels almost too smooth, limiting the sense of cost. The story works as a quiet, lyric escalation rather than a sharply pressurized one.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s crisis of vision and potential transformation—is clear but remains largely internal and unopposed. Once she finds the pearl, the shift into “bright darkness” happens without any real test of will, ethical tension, or risk of loss, so escalation feels more like an inevitable leveling-up than a pressured decision. The pilgrim’s arrival does not complicate her options; it simply affirms them. As a result, the story has beautiful beats but limited tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the community can bear to recover exiled memories—is clear, and the choice to use staggered intervals shows some tactical thinking under emotional pressure. However, there is minimal escalation: no serious setback, challenge, or on-page resistance tests Elara’s strategy or the community’s capacity. As a result, tension remains gentle and the final “success” comes with only lightly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he will truly confront the “fortress of unspoken truths” or stay with old habits—is set up early and escalates as he moves from following faint arrows to stepping on the tracks and finally pressing the punch into the gate. The shift from external journey to internal ordeal in the hall of mirrors is an effective tightening under a situational/accumulative lens. That said, the opposition is mostly atmospheric and symbolic; there’s little specific resistance or loss beyond generalized trembling and cracked reflections, so the pressure never quite feels irreversible. His final decision to walk away from the now-open fortress is a credible internal resolution, but the on-page price is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s internal stance: will she risk opening herself to a tool she doesn’t believe in to help a grieving village. There is one major deepening when the tile overwhelms her with the builder’s memories, reweighting her skepticism and compelling transcription. Yet pressure is relatively gentle—there’s little sense of danger, moral dilemma, or real option she might refuse—and the experience feels more like an inevitable revelation than a hard-won choice. The result is a graceful arc with limited escalation or sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he will risk complete unmaking to end his endless stasis—is clear and steadily tightened by the storm’s crescendo and the singular chance at spatial mutiny. Escalation is legible: rising storm activity → increasing amulet response → arrival at the geometry-frayed chamber → the act of insertion and subsequent dissolution. The cost is unmistakable: he forfeits existence for knowledge, with the on-page scream of his dimensional awareness and the “scar” left behind. The main limitation is that resistance never meaningfully surfaces, so pressure rises externally (storm, geometry) more than via tested ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are high on paper (a hunted geneticist’s life and Maya’s moral calculus), and the countdown-like patrol plus “ninety seconds” create a clear pressure frame. However, the conflict never truly bites; the guard is neutralized instantly by the ink with no misstep, partial failure, or hard trade-off beyond ordinary risk. Internal and external stakes are nicely braided conceptually, but escalation is linear rather than tightening, with no serious test of Maya’s resolve or resourcefulness once the plan is set in motion. The result is engaging but not yet gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are largely thematic and internal—the preservation of lost textures versus the town’s erasure—but they never face concrete opposition or complication. There is no meaningful escalation or reversal; Silas performs his ritual, executes his craft, and ends in serene satisfaction without having to trade off or surrender anything. The result is lovely but low-pressure, limiting narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming/constructing an identity under bureaucratic erasure—is signaled and maintained, with the label discovery as the key tightening beat. However, pressure remains largely conceptual; there’s no real sense that a path is foreclosed or that an alternative is seriously considered and refused. The escalation from wandering collector to one who anoints a “key” object is meaningful but gentle. For elite markets, the conflict would benefit from one more tangible or emotionally risky turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to find a meaningful way forward in his search for consciousness’s nature—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains gentle. The main escalation is internal: from failure and ridicule, to taking a “mad” approach, to reinterpreting past rejection via the cello’s resonance and the shell’s inward turn. There is little sense of real risk if he fails today beyond continued frustration, so the cost of his choice to shift questions is conceptual rather than felt. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent but lacks a sharp tightening or genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the carnival community can adapt to privatization without losing its soul—is clear and persists throughout. There is one main tightening: Mara shifts from archivist to organizer via encoded graffiti, culminating in the barges’ arrival and consultation meetings. However, escalation remains abstract: we are told of “waves” of gentrification and reorganization but see no concrete, escalating confrontations, sacrifices, or near-failures that test her strategy. The ending’s partial openness (curious developers, “unexpected openness”) softens the felt cost, so tension never quite peaks on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing an unrepeatable phenomenon before the orbital shift and radiation ban it forever—is clear and conceptually strong. Yet, in practice, the conflict is largely declared rather than dramatized: he must “outlast” cold and exhaustion, but we never see his resolve meaningfully tested, nor any real risk of failure once the process starts. The chief tightening comes from the time window of the light show and the triggering of the dual-stage chemicals, but these unfold smoothly without complication or trade-off. As a result, tension is present but modest, and escalation never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    The apparent stake—repair the drone before the ship’s maiden voyage—is established, but it never truly bites; nothing meaningful happens if he fails, and we never see the possibility of failure exert pressure. Problems (cracked wings, dim circuits, misaligned sensor, overlooked backup flaw) surface only to be immediately and smoothly solved. There is no genuine reversal or hard trade-off, just a sequence of routine adjustments, so tension barely rises. The ending is pleasant but not earned through escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual: the significance of discovering “where the rivers begin” and the mystery of the mentor’s disappearance. Opposition is diffuse—worrying tranquility, time, and ephemerality—so Elias is rarely forced into visible trade-offs or real risk on the page. The one meaningful tightening is the fading of condensation patterns that pushes him to record and plan departure now, but it lacks a sharp sense of danger or sacrifice. As a result, tension is present but mild, without a decisive pressure point that would fully justify the charged setup.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.7)
    There is essentially no antagonistic pressure—only a one-way ritual where the tuner acts and the town compliantly awakens. Stakes (restoring the town) are clear and large in scale but never feel in doubt, and the tuner never faces a choice that could foreclose a path or alter tactics. Escalation is textural (more light, more echoes, clock tower reactivation) rather than conflict-driven. As a result, the piece is beautiful but low-tension, closer to a descriptive incantation than a story with real struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Marina’s survival vs. transcendence, and the risk of being destroyed or transformed by the temple—are clear, and time/oxygen/water provide a scaffolding of external pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when she must “unsnarl the temporal threads” by accepting distortion of her own timeline, and a second when water breaches and she chooses integration. However, escalation is more stated than felt; many threats are not tested in concrete beats, and the key choice reads almost foregone rather than wrung from competing live options.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—escape before discovery of the bodies and before the warden arrives—are clear and time-bound, and the act of stepping through a solid wall is a meaningful tightening. The interweaving of internal stakes (identity, legacy) with external stakes (survival, justice) works well conceptually. However, the escape itself proceeds without real resistance or reversal once the method is decoded, so tension peaks in anticipation rather than in the act. The warden’s approaching footsteps add pressure but never quite coalesce into a fully realized confrontation or hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether their bond can reawaken across lifetimes and at what cost—is clear, and pressure does build as her appearances become more intimate and the bead glows stronger. The key tightening is his sudden memory at the pomegranate tree and her full materialization, which reweights everything. However, neither character faces a hard, on-page dilemma; the “debt payment” feels more like an ordained event than a contested choice with alternatives. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—how Elara responds to an uncanny, emptied world and whether she will merely witness decay or intervene—is conceptually present but rarely pressured. Her choice to sew is not clearly opposed by risk, scarcity, or internal resistance, so the escalation from discovery to transformation reads as a gentle deepening rather than a tightened conflict. The glowing sleepwalking paths and thickening air hint at cost or danger without concretizing it. As a result, the story succeeds as a lyric transformation but lacks felt jeopardy or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elara can meaningfully reconnect with her ancestry and restore her faith—and this is signaled early. Pressure does escalate somewhat from anticipation, to discovery of the tomb, to the click of the sundial and the miraculous light, but opposition is minimal and events proceed smoothly once the tomb is located. There’s no real on-page risk of failure or alternative path, so the “choice” to place the base carries more emotional than situational tension. The result is affecting but low-suspense, keeping conflict and stakes in the competent rather than gripping range.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and thematic—whether his ritual has meaning and whether anyone will ever care—without any concrete pressure on this specific morning. There is no escalation; from the first paragraph to the last, he is doing the same ritual with the same calm confidence. His “choice” to complete the chalk mandala and catalog it is never in doubt, so no live option is foreclosed. As a result, tension is minimal and the piece reads more as a static character and world sketch than a story under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    The declared stakes (a galaxy-spanning coup, silenced voices) are enormous, but on-page pressure is surprisingly low. Elias encounters no opposition, no risk of discovery, no failures or reversals—his only “escalation” is stitching faster while the flame brightens. The supposed tightening (“time was running out,” “before the coup”) never forces a painful trade-off or forecloses a path in scene. As a result, tension feels mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating an unspoken apology from limbo—is clear but very one-sided; there’s minimal resistance or real risk to the medium, so pressure rises more in lyric intensity than in felt jeopardy. Escalation comes from moving deeper into the labyrinth and from short phrases (“I’m sorry I didn’t choose you” → “I was afraid” → cascading regrets), culminating in the moonlit healing, but each progression feels almost guaranteed rather than contested. The need for moonlight introduces a mild constraint, yet the story never threatens failure or serious cost if it’s not reached. Overall, tension exists but stays gentle and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are quiet but coherent: whether Elias will stay numbed-out or risk re-engaging with suffering in a way that might reopen his own wounds. Pressure escalates modestly—from passive waiting, to the girl’s “code,” to the recognition that he’s reading a map through her pain that implicates his own. The conflict remains almost entirely internal and textural, with little external resistance or tangible consequence beyond emotional cost. It works for a lyric piece but doesn’t fully tighten into a high-tension crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can Elara access and “rediscover” lost joy—is clear but faces little real opposition. The main tightening is her energy waning as the light show flickers, yet there’s no serious doubt or failure mode dramatized before that; the ritual simply works. As a result, tension is more meditative than pressured, with minimal sense of trade-off beyond fatigue and transience. The ending stance is earned, but escalation feels gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elara clings to restorative certainty or surrenders to a more radical, imaginative engagement with art—and it is clearly signaled. Pressure does increase somewhat through the three “awakenings,” moving from disorientation to self-implication in the garden’s pulse. However, conflict remains gentle: she never seriously hesitates, pays no explicit price for staying or leaving, and faces no meaningful loss beyond a soft reordering of perspective. The result is a lovely but low-tension progression rather than a strongly escalated one.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—smuggling untaxed thought past a lethal regime—is clear, and pressure escalates from quiet conspiracy to imminent raids to a razed garden. However, Silas’s key stance choice (“we double down”) is only lightly tested on the page, and the price paid is mostly symbolic (destroyed plantings) rather than a sharply felt personal or relational cost, which keeps the conflict from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether his endless, painful labor will ever be transmuted into genuine peace—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure does escalate in an accumulative sense from quiet routine to the extraordinary manifestation of the blossom and his decision to reach for it, which functions as the crucial choice. However, much of the resolution feels granted by the cosmos once he steps outside; his agency is mostly endurance plus one accepting gesture, with little sense of risk that he might refuse or lose something tangible in the moment. The conflict stays primarily contemplative rather than sharply contested, which softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the library’s magic and the names within it at personal cost—is clear and present early. Escalation is modest but real: the relatively “easy” chime repair leads into the locket, which extracts a piece of the caretaker’s own memory, and the ending frames the burden as ongoing and cumulative. Internal conflict (duty versus foxglove regret and hesitation) runs underneath but rarely forces a sharp trade-off or visible loss beyond the stated emotional drain, keeping tension more meditative than taut. The piece would gain from one more concrete, irreversible consequence tied to the sacrificed memory.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—will she bridge the silence and restore the relationship before their paths diverge—is signaled, and writing the series of promises is a clear line of agency. Pressure technically escalates via increasingly risky vows and the ink well’s depletion and shattering. Yet there is no real resistance or complication; nothing pushes back against her plan, and his immediate, apparently positive response undercuts any sense of hard-won cost. The conflict remains largely internal and is resolved without a meaningful trade-off or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stakes—how much water to release and what that means for the town versus past sacrifices—are articulated, and his choice to recalibrate is a genuine stance crystallization. However, there is minimal escalation: no new external information or event beyond the letter’s decoding raises the cost or urgency in a concrete way. Pressure stays largely internal and abstract, so the ethical calculus feels important conceptually but not viscerally tested. The piece functions as a thoughtful realization rather than a fully stressed conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will risk the meteorite chip, and thus his last tangible echo of his sister’s song, on this fragile, almost absurd plan—is clear and paid off when he actually lets the bird go. Pressure does deepen from conceptual method-building to the concrete, tremor-handed attachment of the chip and the bird’s brief hesitation at the open loft door. However, escalation is more meditative than tense; opposition is largely internal, with minimal resistance or complication beyond his own fear and the bird’s skittishness. The cost is felt but not sharply tested by an external obstacle, keeping the conflict strong but not electrifying.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is Elea’s need to understand thresholds and her place in maintaining or crossing them, but this remains largely abstract and unopposed. Pressure accumulates gently as she studies the logbook and wood grain, culminating in an internal realization rather than a sharply tested choice. There is a mild tightening as she connects the codes to “necessary distances” and accepts a guardian role, but no concrete alternative or sacrifice is dramatized. As a result, conflict feels conceptual rather than lived, limiting tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elara’s need to understand how she belongs—braided with the mystery of the abandoned facility. There is an escalation from mere curiosity to system activation to shared revelation, but each step unfolds smoothly with no real friction, risk, or trade-off; everything she tries essentially works. This keeps tension gentle and wonder-driven rather than pressured, fitting the tone but limiting narrative bite. The closure is earned in logic, yet the story largely sidesteps meaningful cost or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—solve the mystery of the vanishing memory paths before these seeds’ impressions dissolve—is clear, and the arrival of the dark, empty seeds is a meaningful escalation. The recognition that paths are being deliberately emptied is a real knowledge shift, but it doesn’t force a hard choice or visibly narrow her options beyond “continue investigating next season.” Pressure remains mostly intellectual and procedural rather than visceral. As a result, tension accumulates, but the story avoids any turn that exacts an on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain soft: Elias’s goal is announced, but he encounters no real resistance—everyone and everything (woman, violinist, clock) aligns to his plan. The only “tightening” is moving from bishop placement to the clock’s reset, but no option is genuinely foreclosed or made costly. Internally, he’s a little nervous (“heart hammered”) but not torn; success doesn’t demand a trade-off. The result feels more like a stylish demonstration of competence than genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—completing a dangerous, identity-erasing transformation to create an untouchable scripture—is conceptually high, and the binding to the garden provides a structural constraint. However, on-page conflict is mostly declarative; the dance proceeds without mishap, doubt, or visible resistance, and no clear alternative path is ever tested or foreclosed. The one tightening is the transition from preparation to the irreversible fledge, but it lacks a felt price beyond abstract risk. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether he can recontact meaning and purpose through his ritual before the day’s ordinariness returns. That pressure is gestured at via the repeated “before everything shifts,” but nothing in the story meaningfully jeopardizes his ability to do so; no external or internal obstacle escalates. The succession of ripple-readings accumulates texture but not real narrowing of options or cost. As a result, the resolution feels more like a reaffirmed routine than a tested or costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconfigure his relationship to his trauma and perceived “bargain”—is clear but largely internal and reflective. Pressure accumulates gently as he opens the box, handles the bell, and revisits his past, leading to a single main deepening rather than distinct turns or foreclosed options. His agency at the end (choosing to reinterpret the bargain and continue walking) is real but low-temperature, with limited sense of risk or cost in the moment. The piece reads more as contemplative resolution than conflict truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find a workable “equation for hope” that withstands tide and change—is established but stays abstract and largely unthreatening. Pressure does rise somewhat via the needle’s intensifying reactions and the encroaching water, which challenges and then reshapes her designs. However, she never faces a truly narrowing choice or trade-off; there’s no real risk of failure or alternative path foreclosed, so the escalation remains gentle. The final resolution feels more like a smooth culmination than a tested commitment under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is internal—how Elian will relate to the burden of legacy and the danger of listening “too closely”—but the story keeps that pressure relatively soft. The main escalation is the woman’s apparition in the wall, which meaningfully deepens his understanding yet doesn’t force a hard trade-off or visible price. There’s no true narrowing of options; by the end he simply embraces his role with little on-page resistance. Tension thus operates more as eerie curiosity than as conflict with real bite.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    The main pressure is temporal: finish the mirage before the cathedral bells break the hush and dissolve it. This live clock is effective but the painter never seriously risks failure, nor does she face an opposing force beyond routine constraints. Internal conflict is minimal—she’s competent and steady, with only a small spike of excitement—so escalation feels more like gentle crescendo than genuine test. As a result, the stakes read as delicate but not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can truly face and carry the weight of his failures—is clear and consistently held. Pressure does increase modestly as he reads name after name, his voice trembling, with the clipboard’s weight shifting from burden to resolve. However, escalation is relatively even; there’s no strong on-page narrowing of options or visible trade-off beyond enduring discomfort to complete the ritual. The result is a thoughtful but low-simmer conflict profile rather than a sharply tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can convert the last physical remnant of a species into a non-corporeal echo without destroying it—is clear and morally fraught given he caused the conditions of its extinction. Pressure escalates from mere transport and placement to activating a device that may “return… or shatter it forever,” culminating in the irreversible loss of the egg’s body. However, the outcome feels emotionally weighted toward successful transformation from the outset, so suspense about failure or alternative choices remains muted. The cost is real (the last intact egg is gone), but the story never quite forces him to face a wrenching, on-page dilemma between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—remaining safely defined by others versus risking self-authored identity—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates as the threads become more tangled and morally fraught, with the knot of half-truths and the glowing red thread functioning as genuine tightening moments. Still, the conflict stays largely interior and symbolically mediated, with little sense of real risk beyond discomfort, which softens the felt price of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is largely philosophical: whether and how an “ethical storyteller” should wield narrative responsibility. There are glimmers of external pressure (unsettled audiences, a sneering critic), but none of these forces Elias into a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. His trajectory feels steady rather than escalatory; each step confirms his path instead of cornering him into a riskier stance. As a result, tension is present but muted, with limited sense that any option is meaningfully foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can meaningfully honor a vanishing species and “overlooked histories” through a transient signal—is clear but remains largely contemplative. Pressure does accumulate via the dying monarchs and the awareness that rain will erase the structure, and his incorporation of a fallen butterfly is a small but real escalation of his commitment to ephemerality. However, conflict is mostly internal and resolved without significant resistance; he never seriously wavers between preservation and dissolution or between staying and leaving. As a result, tension is present but low-grade, and the escalation feels more like a steady hum than a sharpened turn.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his guilt into a living preservation of the forgotten—is clear, but pressure remains relatively low throughout. Once he begins reconfiguring the braids, there is no real sense of risk, possible failure, or moral trade-off; everything works as hoped, and his internal resistance doesn’t spike under stress. The ritual moment where the light blooms and voices emerge serves as the main tightening, but it doesn’t markedly foreclose alternatives or demand a hard choice. This reads as a beautifully rendered fulfillment rather than a tested resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the failing directive while interrogating Kael’s own purpose—is clear and present early, and escalates from preventative tinkering to the radical act of offering his mind. The internal and external conflicts are tightly braided conceptually. However, the on-page pressure during the core dream confrontation is relatively soft; there’s little sense that he might fail, suffer damage, or face a non-trivial trade-off besides abstract fear. As a result, the resolution feels more like an elegant maneuver than a truly tested sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—completing the cosmic pact before the new regime strips the site—is clear, but opposition stays largely notional (inspectors never arrive; nothing interrupts the ritual). Escalation is mostly a gentle tightening of time and atmosphere toward the alignment rather than a pressured sequence of constrained options. As a result, the climax reads more as a foregone consummation than a choice with sharply felt alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether each person will relinquish resentment—is clear and present in every encounter. There is some momentary resistance (Maya’s recoil, Leo’s trembling), but the conflict resolves almost immediately once the music plays, with no real risk of refusal or failure. Escalation is mainly quantitative (six transformations) rather than qualitative; the pressure doesn’t truly tighten or demand a harder choice. As a result, the outcomes feel gentle and foregone, with limited sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can invite the runaway dream back—is signaled early and structurally resolved. However, escalation is gentle: once the ritual begins, there is little sense of risk, competing options, or what failure would concretely cost beyond a vague loss of possibility. The dream’s return feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with no real trade-off or sacrifice required from Elian. This keeps tension modest even as the imagery intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully respond to the familial breach—is clear, but on-page pressure stays relatively level throughout. Her main act (planting ribbon/seed/relics) is moving yet unopposed; there’s little sense of an alternative tactic or real risk beyond generalized uncertainty about her daughter’s return. Escalation is more additive than tightening: each new object deepens the ritual but doesn’t really foreclose a path or force a trade-off. As a result, the ending feels quietly poignant but not hard-earned under conflict stress.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Margaret embraces this nonlinear inheritance of forbidden knowledge—is present but remains largely abstract. Pressure “escalates” via more frequent breakthroughs and blurred realities, yet we rarely see concrete costs or hard choices on the page; she never seriously considers refusing the role or destroying the object. The eventual decision to leave the cameo and note is more a gentle settling than a forced trade-off. As a result, tension is interesting but muted, with limited felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—rescued vs. absorbed/entombed in the Stack’s logic—is legible and escalates intellectually as Elara shifts from physical search to abstract negotiation. The key tightening is the realization that the diary is from the library, not a guide to it, forcing a change in strategy toward constructing missing plants and using legalistic language. However, the on-page pressure remains mostly conceptual; there is little sense of time running out, personal fraying, or concrete loss that would deepen the felt cost. The final rescue choice (speaking his true name) is strong but comparatively easy, as his resistance or the mountain’s pushback are understated.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—break the ship’s loop and reach the garden to resolve the twin’s identity—is clearly signaled, and there is one main escalation when the twin enters the engine room to confront the tangled threads. However, opposition remains mostly conceptual: the fog’s grasp and the ship’s looping memories appear, then yield as soon as the twin asserts will with the card, so there is little sense of risk or potential failure. The sacrifice of their “fractured identity” is framed as pure gain, so the final choice lacks a sharply felt trade-off. Tension is present but muted, limiting the sense of genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering “lost stories” and resolving the ontological anomaly—exists but remains abstract and largely unopposed. Once Elias steps through the door, he intuits the rope’s logic almost immediately and encounters no serious reversals, resistance, or risk to self. The tightening comes from conceptual deepening rather than escalating danger, which is valid but keeps pressure low. As a result, the merging of doors reads as a graceful solution rather than a hard-won, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—carving out sanctuary from overwhelming noise—is clear and relevant from the outset. Yet the pressure doesn’t really tighten: the energy beings drift by but never threaten to break in, the spell never misfires, and Lorne never has to choose between two bad options. His main act (conjuring the hush) succeeds on the first try with no discernible penalty beyond its temporary nature. As a result, tension remains low and escalation feels more like a linear procedure than a true test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    The declared stakes—last working light, meaning in a broken world—are enormous, but on-page conflict is mostly procedural and internalized. There is no serious obstacle or credible risk of failure dramatized once the process begins; each step progresses without reversal or complication. Kaelen’s agency is evident in his preparations and actions, yet the cost of success never bites, and no significant option is foreclosed. The resulting tension is more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can meaningfully “sculpt identity from experience” in the face of ephemeral phenomena—is present but stays largely internal and unopposed. There is one clear tightening when he discovers the fog’s separate timeline and realizes the transience of his window, which nudges him into urgent note-taking. Beyond that, pressure does not materially escalate; no concrete threat or dilemma directly challenges his ability to act. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully textured meditation more than a conflict-driven scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Marlo’s battle with hopelessness—is clear, but pressure remains gentle; there’s little sense that failure to find meaning tonight would truly cost them something tangible. The main tightening is the move from unseeing to seeing via the chant and burning knot, but this is more discovery than test, with minimal resistance or genuine danger from the fire or fortress. The resolution is essentially an internal reframing that comes without a hard trade-off or visible loss. As a result, tension is present but modest, keeping conflict and stakes in the competent but not compelling range.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether and how this difficult conversation will be entered—is clear but held at a low simmer throughout. Pressure builds modestly through Mara’s unfinished opening, the heavy pause, and Elian’s choice to remain in metaphor, yet there’s no strong tightening where a concrete option is clearly foreclosed. The final decision to let the conversation “find its proper cadence” is a meaningful stance but lands as gentle inevitability rather than a hard trade-off. This keeps the conflict credible but somewhat underpowered for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s drive to collect silences—is clear, but opposition is nearly absent and risk feels entirely abstract. Her “agonizing and divine” effort is described, yet she’s never forced to trade off, stop, or choose between competing pressures. The return of gravity functions as an external cut-off rather than a consequence of her actions or a test of commitment. As a result, tension accumulates texturally but not dramatically, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    The nominal stake—whether the terrace’s silence is unsettling or comforting—is intriguing but remains abstract and largely unopposed. Once Elara decides to place the vial at the central prism, nothing seriously threatens failure; no alternative strategy, loss, or trade-off is tested. The “tension in the air” and the terrace “leaning into her” never escalate beyond a faint unease. As a result, conflict feels static and the resolution unearned in cost, which is a major weakness at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared as exile, loss of the shard to system purge, and humanity’s relationship to its past, but on-page resistance remains soft. The guards are neutralized offhandedly by “strange frequency emissions,” the ticking clock never forces a hard trade-off, and the stairway presents no real test beyond walking it. The main tightening is informational rather than agonistic: as he ascends, he learns about the collapse and realizes the throne’s true nature. The result is conceptually engaging but emotionally under-pressured; escalation feels smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s soul/psyche versus the encroaching despair-entity and the price of reopening connection—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates as the threshold thins and the presence “presses” against her reality, culminating in a binary choice to stay sealed and be consumed or risk communion. The external and internal conflicts interweave nicely via her history of contagious sorrow and burned bridges. Conflict remains somewhat abstract and never quite crystallizes into a specific, immediate on-page consequence beyond description, which blunts visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transmuting Leo’s emotional/financial pressure into literal diamonds and closure—is clear from early on. However, conflict is mostly declared rather than dramatized, and once the ritual begins, escalation is linear and safe-feeling: the instructions work as advertised with no on-page risk, resistance, or temptation to stop. The cost is framed as emotional purging but isn’t tested by any real pressure or trade-off in the scene. As a result, tension is present in concept more than in lived beats.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will uncover and accept the hidden truth of his dynasty—is signaled early and answered by the end. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and speculative, with the environment and ancestor-figure offering information rather than real opposition. The main “tightening” is the shift from suspecting there’s a secret to seeing the dynasty as a prison, but Elias is never forced into a hard trade-off or visibly loses anything on the page. The result is a gentle escalation that informs him rather than truly pressures him.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he will unlock and carry “the shape of possibility”—is present, but tension is low because nothing meaningfully opposes him. The orchard’s responses and time bending are atmospheric rather than obstructive; he never doubts, hesitates, or risks losing anything by proceeding to the gear. The unsnapping is a clear turn, but it reads as an inevitable ritual step rather than a pressured choice with live alternatives. As a result, escalation feels more like accumulation of imagery than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant conflict—Elias’s struggle to find meaning and hope within a bureaucratic graveyard of lives—is clear, and the discovery and tracing of the button deepens rather than resets that pressure. However, resistance is almost entirely internal and soft; nothing meaningfully pushes back against his goal, and his path to a small victory is relatively unimpeded. The emotional stakes matter, but escalation is more a steady warming than a true tightening that forecloses options or forces a difficult trade.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—smuggling unaltered history into public view—is clear and scaled appropriately for this length. There is one main tightening beat when she commits to broadcasting Marcus and the alarms begin to sound, but the path to that climax is almost frictionless: no patrols, glitches, or near-failures test her resolve on the page. Jenna’s disappearance is mentioned as “plans unraveling” but never turned into direct pressure in the scene. As a result, tension is more conceptual than visceral, and the cost remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the town’s collective amnesia—is high and clearly signaled, and the accumulating prophetic notes in everyday sounds create a subtle pressure. However, on-page conflict remains largely uncontested: nothing directly interferes with Elias in the grotto, and his method works without visible strain or near-failure, so tension feels more conceptual than visceral. The “this morning is critical” claim doesn’t materialize as a distinctly harder or riskier attempt, which flattens escalation. The final sense of cost comes more from ongoing burden than from a sharpened, climactic test.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—accessing and restoring lost memories/purpose—is clear, and the Three Moon alignment provides a natural moment for intensification. The prodding of the speck is a genuine turning point that changes Elias’s options and knowledge. However, opposition is almost entirely absent; things go right for him once he acts, and there’s no real trade-off or cost to accepting this new role. As a result, tension feels modest and escalation is more a sequence of wondrous reveals than pressure that forces difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant conflict—control/order vs. embracing uncertainty—is clear, and there is one solid tightening when he chooses to descend with no equipment, trusting the unreliable compass. The discovery of the backward-spinning clock and his decision to let his own broken parts go provide an internally driven resolution. However, external stakes (danger in the descent, risk of loss) feel soft and are never truly tested, so tension remains more conceptual than visceral. The story could use one additional moment where his old impulse to fix directly clashes with the new path, with some visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—how he will live with Lyra’s absence and his guilt—is clear, and pressure coheres around whether he clings to perfectionism or accepts fracture. Escalation occurs via his decision to physically alter the coin, turning an abstract intention (“kintsugi intentions”) into a risky, irreversible act that redefines its meaning. Cost is legible in his relinquishment of an idealized, “perfect” balance and of the hope that Lyra will return unchanged. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, lacking one extra tangible or interpersonal pressure point that could sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high (souls trapped in unresolved grief), but on the page the conflict is almost entirely unopposed. Each spectral encounter resolves once he adjusts his tune; there’s no serious risk of failure, setback, or moral trade-off that would narrow his options. The main “tightening” is merely moving from woman to child and then to the final ritual, without a true escalation of difficulty or cost. This leaves the piece more as a contemplative vignette than a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary conflict is internal: can Kael use his trauma and hyper-awareness to derive a framework for mercy rather than be ruled by pain. There is a discernible escalation as the trauma response ramps up and he “braces” for the remembered mask-pressure, culminating in the equation insight and a calmer, reoriented stance. Still, the stakes feel largely abstract and contemplative; there’s little sense that failure here would alter his concrete fate in the forest or that he forgoes a tangible alternative. The cost of his breakthrough—beyond psychic strain—is implied but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and joining a lineage of overlooked women translators—is clear, but pressure on that goal stays low. The merchant offers immediate help, the canvases yield revelations without resistance, and there’s no on-page risk that she might fail or pay a sharper price. Escalation is primarily an increase in visionary density, not in conflict or tradeoff. The final choice to accept the fragment’s ordinariness and commit to writing is meaningful but lightly tested, keeping tension below elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and resolving the embedded ghost-event in the ceiling—is legible and tracked throughout. Escalation exists but is gentle: from observation to vision to physical impact from the mainspring’s force sphere. Because nothing seriously resists him and the danger is minimal, pressure never quite tightens into a hard trade-off or real risk. The resolution is earned but feels more like a smooth completion of a task than a contested victory.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—remain in ordered eternity versus risk rupture and possible annihilation—is legible early via the whispers and the notion of eternity as a cage. Pressure coheres around the prophecy “The rupture comes with the next press,” which tightens options into one meaningful choice. However, the internal wrestling at that peak beat is somewhat brief; the decision to pull the lever feels more like a foregone conclusion than the culmination of escalating, contested pressure. The later leap extends the conflict resolution but similarly could register a clearer sense of what he might lose by jumping.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary conflict—Kaelen versus the institution’s sterile narrative—remains largely internal and thematic, with opposing forces (curators, administrators) off-page. The meteor storm and psychic-surveillance lore add atmospheric pressure but don’t truly force hard choices or reversals. There is a meaningful tightening when he shifts from nominal participation in the dispute to secret ritual and theft, but resistance is minimal and success comes easily. Stakes feel more conceptual than felt, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are immense and clearly stated—the survival of Sevenbells’ light and boundary between day and night—but they remain mostly abstracted declarations rather than embodied pressures. Elara encounters no opposition, time squeeze, or real risk once inside the chamber; the work proceeds smoothly from setup to triumphant chord. There is a conceptual tightening as he moves from examining invisible fissures to forging the final tether, yet no on-page loss, trade-off, or threatened failure forces a hard choice. As a result, tension is pleasantly anticipatory rather than gripping, undercutting the potential of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will cross from explanation into annihilating mystery—is clear and grows as he follows the compass downward from town to fissure to lagoon. Escalation is mostly accumulative (deeper quiet, deeper descent, more uncanny imagery) rather than driven by sharp reversals, but there is one meaningful tightening when psychometry reveals the prior expedition’s fate and reframes the journey’s endpoint. The cost of his final choice is present but understated; he gives up both dissolution and definitive answers, yet the moment reads as serene more than pressured. A bit more visceral hesitation or temptation in front of the water would sharpen the conflict and raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lyra finding purpose/direction when her technological guidance fails—is legible, and there is a soft deepening when she realizes the sculptures are markers and the slide is a purpose-map. Yet there is minimal genuine conflict: no antagonist force, no hard trade-off, and the storm functions more as background mood than an active threat. Each step (discovering, interpreting, following, completing) succeeds without reversals or loss, so tension remains low. The resolution feels more like fulfilling a puzzle than paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—Lena’s need to understand night-blooming flowers and what her obsession means—is clear and escalates texturally through time and deepening fixation. The pivot at the pavilion and her choice to “reckon with her obsession” and interpret the etched glass does constitute a tightening of internal pressure. Yet conflict remains relatively low-intensity and one-directional; there’s little real resistance or risky trade-off besides lost time and emotional unease, and no competing goal to sharpen the calculus. The result is a graceful but gentle arc rather than a truly tense or costly one.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias uncovers and honors buried civil-rights histories or is absorbed into the lagoon’s forgetting—is clear and does escalate as he moves from reading to arranging “FREE,” to being flooded by the activist’s final hours. His agency in choosing to continue the parley (especially the “REMEMBER” message) shapes the resolution. However, the external risk feels blunted: the retrocognitive “trap” is asserted but never quite bites, and his escape feels more like a narrative decision than the result of a hard trade-off. Tension remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can shoulder the responsibility of designing an entire society without shortcuts—is stated clearly, and the lanterns dimming as he hesitates is a nice moment of pressure. Yet the central dilemma (art vs sustenance, democracy vs elders) is resolved in a single, almost costless move (“He chose balance”), with no genuine trade-off or foreclosure of a path. After that choice, conflict evaporates quickly into smooth success, so escalation and price feel relatively low for the scale of what’s at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what happens when the archived emotions breach containment and how Elias responds—is clear, and the discovery/recognition/immersion sequence provides one meaningful deepening. Conflict is largely internal and conceptual, escalating via revelation (the wax’s message, the nature of the archives) rather than through contested action or visible loss. Elias’s agency at the end is real (choosing to become the bridge), but the cost remains mostly conceptual and future-facing, not acutely felt in the scene. This keeps tension interesting but relatively cool, more idea-driven than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform a curse-like vortex inheritance into a balanced, serene form—is clear and thematically rich. Yet conflict is largely unopposed: each step of the ritual and the passage through the portal proceed without real resistance, failure risk, or moral dilemma on the page. The escalation is more in image density and conceptual scope than in narrowed options or heightened cost. As a result, tension feels modest; it’s absorbing but never gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—warning and protecting the communities below—is clear and present from early on, and the solstice/approaching storm frame gives a notional tightening. The main turn is the siren’s strange echo and Elian’s immediate switch to the cathedral bell, which does show adaptation to pressure. However, nothing truly resists him: no system fails irreparably, no mistake or delay exacts a visible cost, and the storm itself remains offstage. As a result, escalation feels mild and mostly hypothetical, with little sense of a foreclosed option or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s internal search for a way to live meaningfully in isolation and finitude; that’s clear but remains largely abstract. Pressure escalates gently as her practice with the lantern deepens, culminating in the visionary experience, but there is no sharp test that forces a visible sacrifice or trade-off. Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, so tension feels like a meditative thickening rather than a true tightening. This works for the mode but limits felt stakes and prevents a more powerful, high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the oasis’s fragile harmony against encroaching, angrier ghosts—is clear, and the narrative correctly pivots on the covenant’s strain and renewal. Escalation is more implied than dramatized; the “fracturing” unity and testing from outside are reported rather than shown in concrete, escalating incidents. Elisha’s main act (ritual mediation) resolves the issue without serious resistance or sacrifice, so the pressure curve remains relatively gentle. The cost of failure is conceptually high but not viscerally felt on the page, limiting the intensity of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stakes—rediscovering the time capsule and, implicitly, what to do with his remaining time—are signaled, but they never feel risky or contested. Once the urn appears, each step unfolds without meaningful obstruction, sacrifice, or real possibility of failure; the “few days cross-referencing logs” is a montage rather than an escalating test. Internal conflict is also muted: Elias’s fear of his limited time never concretely interferes with or complicates his actions. The ending offers a shift in perspective but without a visible price paid, so pressure stays relatively low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether the poet can transform brokenness into meaning—and it is present early and tested via the snapped kite and the decision to leave the sculpture to the tide. Escalation is subtle: the kite incident adds a live external wrinkle, but tension remains low and there are no sharp reversals. The key cost is conceptual/emotional (relinquishing the artwork to impermanence), which fits the lens but keeps pressure gentle. As a contemplative piece this works, though it lacks a truly tightening squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—accomplish this interspecies “remodel” before death—is clear, and the time limit is stated, but on-page pressure rarely tightens beyond declarative markers (“three months into his sentence,” “final days”). Kaelen encounters no real resistance (internal, environmental, or social), so the conflict curve feels more like steady progress than an escalation that forecloses options or demands trade-offs. The result is moving but somewhat low-tension, with cost primarily conceptual (he dies) rather than dramatized as contested or risky along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will remain outside the pilgrimage or risk participating in an inexplicable ritual that may cost him his skepticism and his talisman—is present but relatively soft. Pressure escalates from intellectual disdain to a tangible test at the pedestal, and the decision to surrender the amber is a real internal price. However, there’s little external antagonistic force or tightening constraint beyond ambiance and curiosity, so the conflict remains largely contemplative instead of feeling sharply contested or dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is mostly implicit and abstract: harmony vs. forgetting, progress vs. preservation, life vs. ecological death. On the page, the coachman encounters no resistance—no pushback from environment, self, or other agents—so pressure barely escalates beyond mood. The tern’s “Now” and his awareness of the enormity of loss hint at internal stakes, but these never force a trade-off or visible price. The result is a beautiful ritual rather than a genuinely pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—bridging emotional and physical distance to his missing sister—is stated clearly and given a concrete test through decoding the cylinder and leaf. Escalation is intellectual rather than dramatic: each step reveals more information, but Elias faces little resistance or genuine risk in the scene. The key tightening is the realization that the leaf contains a second message leading to the dawn bridge, but no meaningful option is foreclosed on the page. Tension is present but gentle, more puzzle-solving than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether Elias remains a passive, grieving observer or actively turns his exile into exploratory purpose—is clear and resolves. Pressure escalates when the ghostly sky appears, challenging his static ritual and forcing him to choose between reverent remembrance and active investigation. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and relatively gentle; there’s little sense that he might refuse or fail. The resulting turn is satisfying but not especially hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Architect’s perfection from smothering the world’s wildness—is clear, and the chess ritual functions as the core conflict vehicle. However, the confrontation itself is remarkably low-friction: the Architect is curious rather than resistant, quickly enters the game, and concedes with minimal struggle. Internal versus external stakes (saving the world vs. risking the relationship/identity) could be brought into sharper tension with at least one real moment where Kaelen might fail or be outplayed. As is, escalation feels more ceremonial than pressured, capping the perceived cost of victory.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will relate to her trauma and performative history—is clear, but on-page pressure remains low and mostly internal. There is some escalation, from noticing absence (pawns, dust) to actively reframing her penumbra as a tool and committing to ongoing work, yet this reads more as a deepening meditation than a pressured turn. No concrete option is sharply foreclosed at the end; instead, we get a refined stance. The piece functions well as lyric reflection, but conflict never quite tightens into a true test.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether she will abandon her current reality for a seeded one—is potent and legible by the end, and the power increasing inside her offers a solid internal pressure track. However, escalation is smooth rather than testing: she gains abilities, practices, and succeeds without real setbacks or on-page resistance, so her final risk reads more contemplative than hard-won. The “hidden thunder” is described as growing but not forced through a specific dilemma that narrows her options in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving self-forgiveness—is signaled early and ties to each step into and through the labyrinth. Yet the conflict inside the labyrinth largely summarizes as “each move a calculated risk” without dramatized missteps, close calls, or visible consequences for failure, so pressure feels abstract rather than acute. The only real tightening is the confrontation with the replicated stalemate, which does deepen the internal conflict but arrives without much prior escalation. As a result, the resolution is earned conceptually but not deeply stress-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Elaran’s drive to uncover and disseminate truth versus the community’s reliance on containment and ritualized forgetting—is conceptually strong. Stakes are articulated (ritual, seals weakening, potential harm to his people), and escalation occurs as his poetry intensifies and finally breaks the spire. However, antagonistic pressure from the community and priests never appears directly on the page, and no concrete consequence arrives during the story; all opposition and damage are projected forward. As a result, tension feels more theoretical than lived in the moment of his key decision.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can complete the statue’s reconstitution and thus resist oblivion—is clear, and the sudden submersion is a meaningful escalation. However, after the wave, the outcome feels never seriously in doubt; he continues narrating with no real trade-off or visible loss besides held breath. Internal and external pressures echo thematically but do not force a sharp choice between competing goods or harms. The ending resolves on a conceptual victory more than on a hard-won, costly success, so tension doesn’t fully peak.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—can he keep his promise to find something “that couldn’t be broken,” or must he reconceive what that promise means. Pressure escalates modestly: the wrong turn and uncanny cave set up a charged moment where he must decide what to do with the shell. The key turn is his choice to submerge it and accept loss, but the struggle is largely pre-resolved in reflective narration rather than pressed in-scene. As a result, the stakes are clear but feel low-intensity, with little sense of risk that he might choose otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal—can he trust his purified whisper to travel, and can he bear the uncertainty of whether it reaches its destination. There is a clear tightening from abstract theory to embodied test to the irrevocable moment of release. However, opposition is mostly conceptual; the scene never quite makes the potential failure or emotional risk bite as sharply as it could. The result is a satisfying but gently escalating arc rather than a truly gripping pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he will continue chasing impossible return or find a sustainable way to live with loss—is clear and sharpened by the impending midnight call. Pressure escalates mainly through the act of drawing the map and the ringing phone he refuses to answer, which is a credible tightening and choice for this scale. The cost of that refusal and of accepting an endless journey is legible but remains primarily internal and quiet. A slightly more concrete consequence or immediate risk linked to the phone or hydraulics would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s ability to secure mental privacy—is signaled early and paid off when she decides to risk using the eye in front of a stranger. The storm, the ticking sense of “before the storm returns,” and the stranger’s empathic sensitivity all provide situational pressure, but escalation remains relatively gentle. There is one meaningful tightening (the stranger’s arrival, which forces Elara’s choice), yet there’s limited sense of what she truly risks if the relic fails or harms her. As a result, tension is present and coherent but does not feel maximally squeezed for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Hemlock can meaningfully decode and honor the stranger’s final gesture—is present but extremely low-pressure, with no real risk of failure or competing obligation. Escalation is more informational than conflictual: as he assembles her backstory, his understanding deepens, but he’s never blocked or forced into a trade-off. His “choice” to adopt the nightly Edelweiss ritual feels gentle and inevitable rather than hard-won, with only a lightly implied emotional burden as cost. The piece functions as a lyric meditation more than a pressured conflict, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue tracing others’ stories or claim authorship of his own—is present and resolved, with escalation from quiet shop to uncanny cavern to intimate confrontation with his personal map. The internal conflict is conceptually strong but under-pressured: he encounters wonder and then rather smoothly accepts its invitation, without a genuine on-page risk, competing desire, or sacrifice. The ants and chip do most of the moving; his agency mainly crystallizes at the finger-on-map moment. That peak choice works, but a felt price beyond abstract comfort loss would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain as human queen or reclaim her celestial role—is signaled early and escalates as she moves from castle to ridge to grotto. Knowledge deepens meaningfully at the grotto when dreams become memories, narrowing her options conceptually. Yet the conflict feels more declarative than hard-fought; we don’t see any serious counterforce from her attachment to the kingdom or fear of the cost, so the final choice lacks bite. The seneschal’s question at the end sharpens the fork, but her answer comes too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain mostly abstract—“revaluing memory” and “density of presence”—with little sense of what might be lost if Elara failed or chose otherwise. The story lacks a significant tightening: once Kael whispers “I found it,” the outcome never seems in doubt, and no alternative path is truly live. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than pressured, which limits the piece’s dramatic impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core conflict—how to live and narrate oneself after seeing one’s own grave—is strong and legible, and the stake (his relationship to time and self) matters. There is a meaningful deepening when he revises his judgment on “getting jealous of past selves” and when the writing session culminates in a reframed stance. However, pressure escalates gently rather than sharply; no specific decision point forces a visible sacrifice beyond internal reframing. The result is thoughtful but low-simmer rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—living without smell and with inherited grief, deciding whether she can reclaim meaning—is clear and personal. Pressure escalates credibly from a tremor-filled, almost ritual visit to the shop toward the focused act of close examination and the emotional spike at the inscription reveal. The cost is mostly internal (facing the depth of her grandmother’s loss and her own), which lands but remains gentle. The overall tension is quiet and could benefit from one sharper on-page dilemma or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his pain into a deliberate, bearable form—emerges early and escalates as the storm pressure mounts and his body begins to crystallize. Choosing to lean into the frightening transformation and write the childish prayer, instead of retreating to academic runes or stopping the ritual, is the key tightening. The price is a permanent, visible alteration that could socially or magically mark him, counterbalanced by inner relief. Conflict remains largely internal and could bear one more explicit moment of doubt or competing desire, but tension is coherent and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving a century-old guilt and freeing Alistair—is well signaled and does reach resolution. However, once the device works, the conversation proceeds with minimal resistance; Alistair is remorseful and receptive almost immediately. The looming demolition and agitated spirits promise external pressure that never truly bites into her choices. As a result, tension deepens but never tightens to a difficult trade-off or visible price beyond sadness and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual: can he integrate contradictory truths and relinquish certainty to perform spiral arbitration. Pressure does grow—library responding to his purpose, words waiting “to be arranged into healing patterns,” the demand for sacrifice—but escalation is smooth rather than sharply turning, with no singular reversal or hard trade-off explicitly dramatized. The dominant stake (repairing fractured reality vs. cost to his own identity/certainty) is present but could be made more concrete in a specific dilemma or failure beat. As a result, tension is intriguing yet muted rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and intellectual: Elias versus the limits of measurement and his colleagues’ quiet dismissal. The one clear tightening—his counting backwards to test the clock—yields new information but doesn’t really narrow options or impose a felt price. Stakes remain abstract (understanding time) rather than viscerally pressured, which keeps tension low and largely static. The ending crystallizes a stance more than it resolves a built-up struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and philosophical—Elias’s desire to understand “letting go” and his curiosity about the woman. There is a mild escalation as observation becomes pursuit and then direct engagement, culminating in a shared decision to collaborate. However, there is little friction or jeopardy; no clear risk if they fail, and no genuine resistance to their insights. The result feels contemplative rather than truly pressurized, limiting the sense of conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elara meaningfully widen her father’s probabilistic worldview after his near-death—is clear early and ties directly to her subway quest and the notebook. However, pressure escalates only mildly: her guilt and “theoretically rebellious” method are noted, but she never faces a serious on-page risk of rejection or loss. The father’s acceptance (“You’ve widened my perspective”) comes with little resistance, so the cost of her gamble feels light. The piece achieves a gentle deepening rather than a sharp tightening or painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Archie’s existential stance toward the loop and his estrangement—is clear but rarely pressured on the page. There is no tangible escalation; we’re told he has “never broken the loop, nor had he tried,” but we never see a night, a call, or a micro-choice that truly tempts him to deviate. The final suggestion that he could someday make his own “final call” is more an atmospheric possibility than a hard dilemma with visible cost. As a result, conflict feels conceptually rich but dramatically static.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how Elias honors Melina and manages the covenant—is established, and there is one clear tightening when he chooses to document her disappearance in full and then act. Yet tension is mostly conceptual; there is no robust sense of what alternative he’s resisting or what it would mean to refuse the covenant this year. His haunted euphoria stays steady rather than escalating or fracturing under pressure. As a result, the final sacrifice reads as thematically apt but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Orion can find a cure for his loneliness—stays legible, and pressure coheres around whether the woman will offer a transactional solution versus something more uncomfortable. Escalation is modest but real: from ironic small talk to the disquiet of being known, to the “bait-and-switch” of the rock being for someone else, to the solitary climb and forced confrontation with his own attention. The final turn (external cure denied, internal work offered) is a credible reweighting that forecloses the fantasy of a simple fix. However, the scene never quite forces a painful decision or trade-off beyond accepting the reframing, so the stakes feel more contemplative than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—finding the stillpoint to soothe his soul—is clear, and the pressure does escalate via the forest’s sonic chaos condensing into harmony and the physical blow of the third note. The B-flat moment is a credible tightening that demands endurance and surrender. Yet the journey feels largely frictionless: no real alternatives or setbacks test his resolve, so options never feel sharply narrowed. The resolution lands, but with minimal sense of loss or sacrifice beyond relinquishing his old mapping paradigm.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether to erase the mistake entirely or reinterpret it—is clear and thematically coherent, and the interpreter’s brief decision to write “The seed was never planted” functions as a genuine tightening and test. The reversion of that choice, followed by the compromise (“wrong soil, but they grew anyway”), provides a credible internal turn with cost: the loss of the imagined clean slate and the acceptance of loneliness and imperfection. Still, the pressure remains fairly low-key and contemplative; the anomaly’s threat never feels dangerous beyond metaphor, which slightly flattens tension. The conflict works but does not bite as hard as it could for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—will their attempt to “translate silence into music” and be remembered matter—is clear but never faces concrete resistance or a narrowing of options. Pressure increases texturally (faster signing, heavier camera, heightened language) rather than through genuine obstacles or tradeoffs. Their goal is essentially achieved without friction: intention plus ritual yields a charged click and a hinted cosmic acknowledgment. Without a visible price or a point where a path is truly foreclosed, tension feels more stated than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—redeeming a past act of destruction and fulfilling a familial/historical promise—are clear and present early. Pressure escalates from discovery to deciphering to the moral decision of what to do with the treaty, interweaving internal and external conflict. However, the climactic choice to burn the scroll could feel more contested; we’re told it’s absolution, but we don’t fully see her wrestle in the moment with the loss of the last historical record. The conflict is solid and coherent but stops short of a truly agonizing trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the entangled shared dream against erasure—is signaled and does intensify as the garden’s resonance grows. Escalation is mostly textural: faster drumming, louder hum, clearer lagoon, a single explicit warning (“We’re running out of time”), then softening into resolution. There’s no tangible counterforce on the page (the experimenters never act in-scene), so conflict remains largely internal and metaphysical, with limited sense of trade-off or sacrifice. The price Kael pays feels more like emotional strain than a clearly dramatized loss or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—winning the bet and proving that whispers travel farther than shouts—is clearly stated and directly tested. Yet escalation is mild: Jenna’s skepticism doesn’t evolve into real resistance, and the whisper demonstration succeeds on the first try without complication. The key and hidden chamber then arrive as rewards, not as hard-won solutions to a sharpened conflict. Because no option is truly foreclosed and no visible price is paid, the tension plateaus rather than tightens toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is Anna’s need to reframe her father’s memory and grief, which is signaled and resolved, but there is little sense of risk or competing options along the way. Conflict is largely implicit and internal, with no real threat that she will refuse the experience, misread it, or be harmed by it; her hesitation never escalates into choice-pressure. The guardian’s “work” proceeds smoothly without obstacle or trade-off, so the only tightening is the slow approach to the viewing moment. As a result, the piece feels more like a ritual demonstration than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—shifting the town’s consciousness—is clear, but it stays abstract and relatively low-tension on the page. Fear of discovery and doubts about effectiveness are mentioned, yet no concrete threat or setback escalates the pressure as the night progresses. Arthur’s “rounds” and final watch in the library unfold smoothly, with no real turn that narrows options or demands sacrifice beyond ongoing risk. The result is thematically rich but dramatically gentle, with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain confined in a life of conformist dock work or claim a freer, truer self—is established early and revisited through her rituals and the island’s demand to detach. There is a clear tightening as the whale’s call intensifies and she must decide at the tree whether to sever ties with her old life or not. Yet most of the opposition is abstract or offstage (social conformity, expectations), so the pressure she faces at the crucial decision reads more as voiced theme than embodied conflict, with no concrete loss or relational rupture shown. Escalation is present but relatively gentle, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining forbidden grief/art under a surveillance regime—is clear and inherently strong. The unscheduled inspector is a solid external pressure, but the scene resolves too smoothly: there’s no tangible near-miss, discovery scare, or forced sacrifice beyond routine concealment. Internal stakes (Elara’s refusal to be “cured” of grief) are powerful but largely affirmed rather than truly tested. As a result, escalation plateaus where it could have narrowed options more aggressively.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—crossing a once-sacred boundary into the atrium—is clear, but on-page conflict is muted. Once the ban lifts, nothing actively opposes Kael; the colonnade’s response is intense but not threatening, and there is no genuine test of commitment or moment where an option is truly foreclosed. Inner doubt or fear is largely absent, so the escalation from observation to transcendence lacks tension even as the imagery amplifies. As a result, the outcome feels more like an inevitable initiation than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—securing an awakening of color—is clear, but pressure on that stake is gentle: Lyra never truly resists, and the bargain is accepted on first presentation without friction. There’s one main escalation (from silent plea to barter consummated to the actual awakening), but Leo’s commitment is never sharply tested, nor are alternative paths or serious risks foregrounded. The final change is large in consequence, yet it arrives without a significant on-page cost or moral tension in the moment of choice. As a result, conflict feels more like a graceful unlocking than an earned trial.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical—what is connection, and is this pilgrimage artificial or real—and this is thematically aligned but low on palpable stakes. Escalation is modest: the main tightening is the decision to sound the tuning fork and step into the light circle, which prompts the environment’s response and insight. There’s little sense of risk or alternative paths foreclosed; nothing meaningful seems to be lost or endangered if the bell ringer fails. The result is a resonant meditation with limited tension.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how grief can be transformed into ongoing purpose—is powerful but mostly pre-resolved before the story opens. There is minimal on-page conflict; visitors arrive and are taught, and we’re told this works rather than watching a moment where his mission is tested or a path foreclosed. The curtains of intention and telescope never force a difficult choice or visible trade-off in-scene. As a result, pressure feels static, with little discernible tightening between first paragraph and last.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—what Elara will do with her discovery—is signaled, and the decision to share it with Chen and then double down on the work is the main tightening. However, external conflict is minimal: Chen offers no real resistance, and potential social or personal risks are only gestured at in his “excitement and concern.” Without a concrete test of her commitment or a visible price paid on the page, the pressure never quite escalates beyond an interesting conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—gaining and “purifying” forbidden knowledge—is clearly stated, and there is at least a conceptual risk in the mention of prior historians’ failures and the coming “end of innocence.” Yet there are no on-page reversals or meaningful obstacles to her success; the ritual proceeds as described and works, so tension and cost remain largely theoretical rather than felt through escalating complications or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope as shadows unbind—is clearly signaled, and there is a conceptual escalation from noticing anomalies to transforming the entire library system. However, conflict remains largely unopposed: the shadows drift but never actively resist; no concrete failure, sacrifice, or narrowed option forces a painful trade-off. Elara’s solution works at scale without visible risk or threatened loss in the present scene, softening the sense of pressure. The result is elegant but emotionally low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—whether to bury the betrayal or confront it with integrity—is clearly stated, and Eleanor’s “start fresh” pressure sets up a real moral fork. Yet escalation is mild: the conversation stays calm, and Maria never seriously seems tempted to choose denial, so the final decision reads as confirmation rather than a hard-won reversal. The cost to Maria (lost years, broken trust) is mentioned but not deeply dramatized in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s ethical and identity crisis over erasing scars—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure deepens when the plants’ “ancient wisdom” exposes the cost of her practice, leading to the tangible step of visiting Samuel. However, escalation is mostly internal and smooth; there’s little resistance or real risk in the Samuel scene, so her new stance isn’t tested under real opposition. The piece delivers a solid turn in perspective rather than a hard-forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether he can locate and thus emotionally reframe unused love—is clear and present from early on. Pressure builds primarily through intensifying inner experience (the unresolved melody, the spiraling crescendo) rather than through antagonistic force or hard choices. There’s one meaningful deepening when he realizes love is stored in “whens,” but there is little on-page resistance, risk, or trade-off beyond the fear that his love will vanish unarchived. The result is thematically potent but somewhat low in felt jeopardy or escalation for a “prestige” short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped creativity enough to gain rest—is legible and tracks throughout, and there is some escalation via the stars’ repeated urgings (“Again,” “Don’t stop”) and her mounting exhaustion. However, opposition remains mostly abstract; Elara never seriously considers stopping or failing and faces no countervailing force beyond fatigue. The brightest meteor and archway flare function as a climax, but the scene lacks a sharp turn or costly trade-off that would tighten pressure. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle and largely unquestioned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering viable futures for a dead world—is powerful in concept but manifests with relatively gentle pressure on the page. The main tightening is the contemplation of the seedling’s branching possible fates and the choice to nurture “the most promising version,” but there’s little active resistance or real risk of failure in-scene. Agency is present (he chooses, practices, plants), yet the path feels smooth and unopposed. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping, which holds it below top-tier for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding and controlling translocation as a path to probing consciousness—is established, and there is one clear tightening when Elian deliberately constructs the seven-tree convergence and focuses on the method. Pressure, however, remains largely conceptual; there is little sense of danger if Elian fails, nor of concrete loss tied to the earlier uncontrolled translocations. The “hum of insight” arrives as an almost frictionless boon rather than something earned through difficult, escalated attempts. The final expansion of consciousness reads as a smooth success rather than a choice with an on-page cost or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is stated but never viscerally tested; no genuine alternative (refusal, getting lost, misusing courage) is made live on the page. Conflict remains almost entirely internal and largely abstract; the traveler faces no serious resistance, and the guides provide steady, unchallenged support. The line “You must be gently persistent” gestures toward struggle, but we never see persistence cost the traveler anything. As a result, escalation is minimal and the resolution feels granted by ritual rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—learning what safety costs in this fortress—is present and sharpened by the revelation of vanished staff in the ledger. Escalation exists in the move from eerie silence to concrete evidence of sabotage and then to systemic erasure, but resistance is mostly conceptual; no one opposes him on the page, and there is no immediate danger once he knows the truth. His final choice to remain is a meaningful renunciation, yet it doesn’t force a hard trade-off in scene (there’s no live alternative or on-page punishment for knowing). As a result, the conflict reads thoughtful but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—eroding a stolen reality and unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and paid off clearly when the false magic is sundered. Escalation is mostly accumulative and off-stage (whispers, growing paranoia), with one focused tightening in the on-page confrontation. Kael’s agency is strong in the long game and in the final act of speaking the master rune; the pretender’s collapse is causally tied to that choice. The cost, however, feels more conceptual than personally painful on the page, and the confrontation resolves quickly with little visible risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can find meaning/purpose in a world of ecological loss—is signaled and resolved, but pressure remains low and mostly internal. The meaningful deepening comes when the console’s data and atlas shapes align, reweighting his understanding of disappearance and rebirth. There are no true reversals or sharply narrowing options; he is never forced into a difficult trade-off, only into a recognition. As a result, tension feels more meditative than urgent, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—will she find a new, durable rationale for the rebellion in its lull—and that’s signaled early. Pressure escalates modestly through the intensifying hum and her decision to physically commit (palms on the stone), which leads to a clear inner turn. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed; her revelation arrives without a serious risk of failure, reversal, or competing value that must be sacrificed. The result is thoughtful but somewhat low-tension and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maeva will disrupt a predetermined destiny for her people—is clear, and there is a single tightening as she moves from decoding theory to physically confronting the amber in the hottest springs. However, antagonistic pressure remains largely abstract: the New Regime and community consequences are offstage, and the curfew never translates into a concrete obstacle. The descent and unsealing proceed with minimal resistance, making success feel somewhat inevitable. As a result, cost and jeopardy are conceptually large but not viscerally escalated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Maya’s struggle between being frozen in trauma and choosing to live with integrated grief—is clear and stakes feel emotionally real. Pressure escalates from reactive freezes to a new kind of “freeze” that is claimed as transcendent, culminating in the small but decisive action of displaying the photograph. This is a quiet, internal arc, but the narrowing of options (hiding vs. honoring Rafe) is legible. Some beats state emotional shifts rather than dramatizing tension at the moment of choice, which keeps the escalation from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain broken or reconstruct a new self-understanding—is signaled, but pressure remains mostly abstract. Once he “hears” the method (untangling threads), there’s little resistance; the mending proceeds without setbacks or genuine doubt. There is one main tightening (choosing to descend into darkness and begin reconstruction), yet the lack of visible price or risk keeps tension low. Conflict here is more meditative than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why time slows in crisis—is signaled and pursued, but opposition is minimal and the experiment works almost too smoothly. There is a mild tightening when the ink begins to disappear faster and the drone “chirps in alarm,” yet nothing truly threatens his goal or forces a hard trade-off. The internal stake (what to do with his anger and marginality) is resolved quietly without being sharply tested. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than pressured, and escalation is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—risking persecution to broadcast destabilizing truths—is strongly signaled, but on-page opposition is almost entirely anticipatory (“sirens that would surely come”) rather than enacted. There’s little meaningful tightening beyond the initial act; once the letter is sent, everything else reads as foregone summary of success and unrest. Without a concrete challenge, trade-off, or visible loss after the upload, the conflict feels under-tested for the scale of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    The core stake—creation and peace versus inherited violence—is compelling but stays largely static across the piece. We see no escalating opposition; the father is off-page, the outside world is mediated via hypothetical merchants “tomorrow,” and the harsh desert never quite intrudes. The closest thing to tightening is the gunfire-like wind, which she endures by reaffirming her ritual rather than adapting under new pressure. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than dynamically tested, which limits tension and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo tonight—is clear and the pressure coherently intensifies as the garden grows restive and the constellations distort, then fall into step with his ritual. Escalation is primarily textural and internal; there’s minimal resistance or reversal once he begins, so success feels somewhat assured rather than hard-won. The cost (his longing poured into the act, the echo becoming part of him) is present but doesn’t materially complicate his options at peak pressure. The result is strong mood-level tension rather than sharp conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering a double murder tied to institutional power—are clear and significant. Escalation comes through deepening knowledge: pen nib → suspicion → hidden passage → full murder hypothesis and recognition of an active, dangerous secret. However, all antagonistic pressure is off-page; she never meets resistance or practical obstacles in the scene, so tension remains largely conceptual. The final choice to publish carries implied danger but no concretely dramatized trade-off or foreclosed alternative in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Orion can resolve the dissonance in his haunted equipment and, by extension, his guilt—is clear and culminates in his decision to encode his apology into a client’s constellation. Pressure escalates as the firmware grows more erratic and the amber begins to resonate, leading to a genuine tightening when his own past voice comes through. That said, the external conflict is low-friction and almost entirely internal; obstacles do not significantly resist him once the key revelation occurs, so the cost feels more contemplative than pressured. The stakes are emotionally meaningful but the path to resolution is smoother than elite-level escalation would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—grasping and possibly altering the emergent hush/unlearning—is clear but remains largely conceptual and low-friction. Pressure does escalate somewhat: ordinary silence becomes a sentient-feeling hush, the tile’s power emerges, and her experiments with the mandala grow more focused, culminating in the decision to interject rather than resist. Yet there is little on-page sense of risk, loss, or alternative paths foreclosed; nothing credible pushes back against her goal. The conflict reads more as puzzle-solving in a safe sanctuary than as a contested transformation with palpable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—can Elara transform a site of horror into something hopeful without erasing its pain—is legible but remains largely internal and unopposed. There is essentially one pressure point: committing the tessera and renaming the Lion, after which the world responds positively without friction or risk. Her retrocognitive suffering is stated as a constraint but doesn’t escalate or materially threaten her ability to act within the scene. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than dynamically rising, and no real option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond a generalized acceptance of endless work.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stakes (theater’s demolition vs. preservation; Arthur’s yearning for purpose) are signaled clearly, and the tarot coin’s activation is a distinct escalation. Yet conflict is relatively low-friction: once Arthur decides to use the coin, there are no serious reversals, setbacks, or costs that test his resolve. The theater’s salvation depends on one expanded performance that works immediately, summarized via distant human reactions. As a result, tension feels more like a graceful swell than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—telepathic overload vs. Elara’s need to remain functional and sane—is clearly defined and the stakes (erosion of self vs. hard-won comprehension) are legible. Escalation is more accumulative than sharply turning: hours of work, physical exhaustion, and increasing density of light/emotion build pressure until she reaches a pocket of stillness. Her agency is real: she devises the method and commits to an arduous process rather than retreating or numbing out. What keeps this below the top band is the relative smoothness of the path; there’s little on-page resistance, reversal, or moment where the plan might fail.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering meaning and becoming “the voice of the unknown”—is clearly signaled, but there is little genuine pressure or escalation beyond the novelty of the mystical phenomena. The fossils float, grant insight, and affirm her purpose without any real opposition, risk, or dilemma; she never has to trade one value against another or endure a loss to gain this role. As a result, tension is soft and the turns feel more like upgrades than true tests.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—altering the village’s foretold fate—is stated early, but on-page conflict centers on a meticulous task that proceeds without resistance. The only explicit pressure, the draining hourglass, does not materially alter her behavior or force a trade-off. There is one soft tightening as the sand nears empty and she places the final button, but no real risk that she might fail or pay a visible price. The resolution feels granted once the ritual is complete rather than wrestled from genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (Althea’s future versus Elias’s ruin) is clear, and the discovery of the pillbox message is a meaningful turn. However, after that, conflict remains largely internal and does not escalate much beyond his initial recognition that it’s a trap he “has to walk into.” The snow-code plan succeeds without friction, and there is no on-page resistance, complication, or cost beyond what’s conceptual. The final choice has weight, but it feels more like confirming an already-decided sacrifice than confronting a sharpened dilemma under increasing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a promise that binds him to a place and state—is legible early, and there is a clear tightening when the whispers coalesce and the boat appears. However, there’s almost no resistance: no credible alternative to waiting, no temptation to abandon the vigil, and no friction in handing over the needle. The internal and external conflicts align, but they remain low-intensity; the cost of his long vigil is implied more than dramatized. As a result, the resolution feels graceful rather than truly tested or hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this anomalous, self-preserving moment will continue—is clear and grows as he moves from observing fractures to risking engagement. Escalation is quiet but real: the thrum intensifies near the nexus, his experiment with smoke and glass raises the chance of disturbing or understanding the anomaly, and the final choice to offer only presence leads to its dissolution. The conflict is primarily conceptual and atmospheric rather than visceral, which fits the mode but keeps tension in a cool register. The price—ending the oasis’s temporal defense—lands, though it could be dramatized with a touch more on-page ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—alleviating winter darkness for the building—is stated, but on-page pressure is low: there’s no real resistance, danger, or consequential trade-off. His secrecy and fear of being dismissed stay hypothetical; no one challenges him, and the superintendent’s response is immediately positive. The night of work doesn’t generate reversals or forced choices, only meticulous progress. As a result, while the situation is meaningful, the conflict never truly tightens, and the final communal shift lacks a corresponding sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, centered on how Elara interprets her solitude and immortality. The stakes—whether she sees herself as cursed or as a guardian—are thematically important but stay abstract, with little on-page pressure forcing the choice now as opposed to any other time. The “another frequency” hint of another like her introduces potential external stakes but comes too late and too softly to function as real escalation. The piece reads more as a meditative character sketch than a scene where options narrow under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elias’s need to re-find a unified thread of meaning—and it’s signaled early. Escalation occurs primarily as a deepening of perception inside the sculpture, culminating in the overwhelming “flood” of secrets. However, there is little overt resistance or concrete dilemma; he moves through the beats without genuine risk of failure or an alternative path. The piece succeeds as a lyric interior conflict, but the pressure line is relatively gentle for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—humanity’s susceptibility to manipulative cosmic signals—is strong in concept but plays out with limited on-page pressure. Once Elara identifies the vulnerability and has the equipment, there’s no genuine reversal or complication; the interference works on the first try without visible cost, pushback, or risk materializing. The departmental power plays and social chaos are described but never actively resist or endanger her plan. As a result, escalation is conceptual rather than felt, and the climax reads more like a procedural step than a truly tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are crisply stated and high—world regions blinking out, reality unraveling, and her personal terror of confined spaces. There is one clear tightening when she begins the ritual and the nexus violently reacts with impossible angularities and prismatic starlight. Yet nothing she does fails or backfires; the external conflict never genuinely threatens to overpower her, and no alternative path or sacrifice is forced. As a result, tension plateaus rather than climbing, and the climax reads more as an inevitable realization of a plan than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will manage to resurrect Lena’s presence enough to awaken empathy—is signaled, but the pressure on it is gentle and mostly internal. The only real tightening is dusk falling and the deepening engagement in the drawing; there is no external opposition or meaningful trade-off that narrows his options. His final choice (to leave the portrait at the museum) is consistent but comes without real jeopardy or sacrifice beyond emotional wear. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-tension conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will pry open or preserve the quarantine—emerges clearly once the console begins to “question” him, and his choice to align the nail with “dangerous but necessary” coordinates is a real tightening. The conflict between honoring a silencing bravery and pursuing dangerous knowledge gives the middle and climax shape, and his agency drives the major turn (weakening the field) and the resolution (withdrawing the nail and accepting the burden). However, the on-page risk from the weakened containment is brief and mostly symbolic; alarms blare, but we don’t see concrete near-loss, which keeps the felt price from fully matching the conceptual stakes. The ending reads more like a controlled brush with danger than a truly harrowing test of his values.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the vanishings and her role in them—is clear but largely conceptual, with minimal on-page opposition. Escalation comes via new information (map, faces, others with fragments) rather than through sharper dilemmas or resistance. The one external pushback—locals dismissing her—is brief and doesn’t significantly change her options or impose a cost beyond mild social isolation. As a result, the piece feels more like an unfolding revelation than a pressure-tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Jasper’s ethical and existential stance toward pattern-prediction and manipulation, with a secondary stake in how he uses his inheritance. Pressure does increase as Elena’s project shifts from prediction to guidance/manipulation, but these shifts are mostly described in retrospect, so there’s limited on-page escalation or forced trade-off. Jasper’s decisive move—quietly leaving the board meeting—is in character but comes almost too easily, with minimal visible cost or internal conflict at the moment of choice. The story ends in a reflective, earned-stasis register rather than a strongly pressurized peak, which suits the mode but keeps stakes feeling relatively cool.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will be drawn into a dangerous, prophetic legacy—appears, but the danger is mostly implied. The main tightening is her catching Whitmore at her charts, which forces him to disclose the prophecy and accept her involvement. Conflict resolves quickly and amicably once they speak; there’s little real resistance, ethical friction, or visible cost on the page beyond shared grief. Tension is present but modest and never truly escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether he will face the vortex to confront his frozen guilt—is clear, and the progression from shore to spell to immersion is a recognizable escalation. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but the danger of the cursed lake and seed use remains abstract; we’re told the price is high but never feel a real possibility of loss beyond generic risk. There’s essentially one straight-line push rather than a tightening that forecloses alternatives or complicates his attempt. Tension is present but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting the eclipsed covenant—is clear early, and the linking-through-scars ritual is a meaningful tightening with bodily cost. However, pressure escalates only modestly: after the painful threshold, the nexus negotiation is almost frictionless, with the entities recognizing each other and softening without resistance or risk of failure. Internal conflict (his fear vs. compulsion) does not significantly alter his choices once the ritual begins. The resolution feels emotionally apt but a bit under-tested for a piece aiming at top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can successfully reshape his destiny and heal his soul—remains clear, but pressure on that stake is mild. Once in the clearing, the ritual proceeds without complication, resistance, or difficult trade-offs beyond the initial decision to attempt it. The stranger’s presence and plea add emotional color but little genuine opposition or moral friction. As a result, escalation is more a steady deepening of mood than a tightening of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Leo’s need to find a renewed sense of purpose after his career-ending failure, signaled early and deepened via his deadening engagement with the estate inventory. Pressure escalates not through external obstacles but through an internal turn: the encounter with the scrap breaks his insulation-by-facts pattern and forces a choice between continuing mechanical appraisal and acknowledging his attachment to “after the applause.” His final decision to pocket the cloth and leave the work unfinished is a credible, if low-key, foreclosure of the old mode. The conflict remains mostly contemplative, so the stakes feel more thematic than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are inherently large—physics of consciousness and death, plus Maris’s need to complete Hamid’s work—but they remain largely abstract and untested. There’s no meaningful resistance to her goal: the breakthrough arrives “by morning,” the seed plants and germinates smoothly, and no live option is truly foreclosed. The dominant tension is quiet—will she find meaning in Hamid’s absence?—and while that deepens, it doesn’t undergo a sharp tightening or reversal. The result is thoughtful but low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very low-grade; there is no real threat to the ritual, the librarian, or the library on the page. The dominant stake—whether wonder can be preserved through cyclical ritual and identity migration—is thematically present but not sharpened into a moment where something might fail or be relinquished. There is minimal escalation: the water rises and the smelting proceeds, but these changes don’t narrow options or force a trade-off. As a result, the ending feels like a continuation of an established equilibrium, not the outcome of tested pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—remaining emotionally bunkered versus risking genuine connection—is well signaled and carries through to the end. However, conflict is almost entirely one-sided: there’s little resistance from the community, no real danger in using the pearl, and Elias’s own hesitation is gestured at more than dramatized. The “gathering” unfolds as a largely frictionless miracle rather than a pressured test of anyone’s stance, so escalation feels more like a smooth swell than a tightening. The emotional reconfiguration at the end is genuine but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can move toward self-forgiveness—emerges early and remains coherent. Escalation comes from his decision to follow the graffiti toward “bad waters north” and to re-enact, in some sense, approaching the dangerous river that took his father. However, the “bad waters” never quite materialize as a concrete on-page test beyond spray and roar, so the external risk feels under-leveraged. The internal resolution is credible but a bit tidy, with limited sense of a price that will continue to bite after the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—grasping and preserving the meaning of unspoken words before the library dissolves—is signaled early and does escalate as delays lengthen and the watch accelerates. Pressure intensifies structurally (cipher nearing completion, library receding), but conflicts remain mostly abstract, with little concrete trade-off or moral tension beyond urgency to document. Her agency is present—she chooses to write, step through fissures, and interpret—but no decisive, costly fork is forced on the page. The result is a coherent but relatively gentle arc of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Clementine must decide whether to hand an empire-changing artifact to the Agent or follow her own newly glimpsed path—is clearly framed. Escalation relies on the ticking clock (approach of midnight and the Agent), and on informational deepening via coffee stains and plant voices, rather than direct confrontation. Her ultimate act of disappearance is a meaningful foreclosure of a path, but because opposition never appears in-scene, the pressure remains more conceptual than visceral. The ethical calculus (empire vs. dream) is intriguing but could feel sharper if any concrete downside of defiance came into the room with her.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core stake—rescuing one last joyous spark from oblivion—is conceptually strong, but the on-page pressure around success or failure remains low. The process of searching the “electromagnetic sea” and waiting for the signal has a gentle deepening rather than a sharp escalation. We’re never made to feel that she might fail, or what concrete cost that failure would carry for her beyond abstract regret. As a result, the conflict reads as beautifully executed routine rather than a tested edge.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—her search for contentment and peace with endless caretaking—is present but only lightly tested on the page. Because the hardest conflict (forgiving the unforgivable) happens before the story’s start, the live scene has little real opposition; she’s already on the other side of the big choice. The main tightening is her mid-climb realization, which shifts her stance but without a visible trade-off or serious temptation to do otherwise. The result is thematically coherent but emotionally low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra can soften her brother’s destructive certainty, via Elian’s mediated method—is clear and present from early on. Pressure coheres around the act of posing the question and the chime-sequence response, culminating in Lyra’s emotional break and relinquishing of the shard. However, there is no real reversal or significant resistance; once the question is asked, the outcome unfolds without visible risk of failure or meaningful alternative path. The conflict is quietly effective but remains modestly escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will grasp and embody “vanishing to appear”—is established and pursued, but the pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested. The main tightening is her deepening trance and eventual realization, yet there’s little sense of real risk or potential failure; success feels almost guaranteed by tone. Kael’s withholding method adds some friction, though not a true dilemma. As a result, escalation is present but mild, more meditative than genuinely fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is clearly established and the arrowhead appraisal does deepen his options by revealing a workable method. However, pressure and escalation are quite gentle; there’s no real narrowing of choices or sharp test of commitment, only a contemplative progression toward insight. The cost of failure or success remains abstract, which keeps conflict from fully biting despite the strong conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stakes—can Kael enact a soulful, impossible magic in the face of automation—are clear, and the ascent plus midnight diagnostic window set up a time-bound opportunity. However, once he commits, there’s almost no resistance: the mist walking works on first try, the sensors are easily bypassed, and the keystone fits without complication. Internal conflict is relatively subdued; his faith is never seriously tested in-scene. As a result the escalation reads more as a steady procession than a tightening, high-cost trial.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can Orion unlock synesthetic perception and validate his brother’s experience—is present early and resolved at the end, but the story lacks meaningful escalation. Once he decides to leave the pier, every step (boat, dive, library, ritual) proceeds without friction, reversal, or genuine risk to body, memory, or vow. Internal and external conflicts don’t significantly interweave; his want is never really tested against fear, doubt, or competing obligations. The result is a beautiful sequence that feels more like an elegant procession than a pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—what message and calibration Elara sends into the next universe—is intriguing but remains abstract; we’re told today’s lot-casting will decide “warning or blessing,” yet no concrete consequences or alternatives are dramatized. Pressure does increase conceptually as the singularity nears, but there’s no sharp moment where a live option is clearly foreclosed or a trade-off bites. Elara’s agency is present but her key decision is more declared than tested. The piece reads more as an elegant setup for a cosmic relay than as a truly pressurized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he will finally face and integrate his grief for Elara—is signaled early and pursued consistently through the act of naming the monsters. Pressure escalates texturally as he moves from “Longing” to heavier abstractions like “Despair” and “Brokenness,” with palpable emotional cost in each naming. However, the conflict remains largely one-directional and ritualized; there’s little sense of a genuine risk of refusal or reversal once the process begins, so tension plateaus rather than sharpens. The final renunciation (leaving the monsters behind as witnesses) is earned but not hard-won in on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—can Kael, with meager power, repair a cosmic imbalance—is clear, and there is a meaningful turn when the bell heals yet the world remains unchanged, plunging him into disappointment. Pressure does increase in a gentle, accumulative way through the irregular drips stabilizing, the glow, the hum, and then the apparent failure before the viaduct’s note reframes the outcome. However, stakes remain mostly conceptual and are never forced into a moment of genuine dilemma or trade-off; his tactics never have to change in response to loss beyond enduring discouragement. The cost is largely emotional and lightly sketched, so tension never quite tightens into something that feels truly consequential at scene scale.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to a submerged past (guarding vs. expunging vs. revoicing)—is clear but not sharply tested. Pressure rises only gently: the chime’s silence as a signal and the ritual’s culmination provide a cadence shift more than a true escalation. There is no concrete threat to the dam or a moment where he must choose between incompatible actions. As a result, tension is contemplative rather than taut, which dulls the sense of real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—whether Elara can truly achieve a union of intellect and intuition—is established, but pressure around it remains gentle. Her method (interpreting starlings, adjusting the flame) advances the process, yet nothing threatens failure or forces a visible sacrifice or reversal. Escalation is more about intensifying reverie than narrowing options, and no alternative path is meaningfully weighed or renounced. As a result, the transformation reads as inevitable rather than hard-won, tempering tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—maintaining trust and purpose in the face of silence and possible betrayal—is legible, and it tightens as static clears and nothing replaces it. The primary on-page escalation is the decision to step off the branch despite the unresolved warning and absence of contact, with the parachute as the concrete risk boundary. However, conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric; there is no sharply defined alternative path or explicit negative outcome if trust fails, which limits visceral tension. The return of the voice resolves the pressure more as emotional reassurance than as the culmination of a clearly dramatized, high-cost dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—who gets to be the “real” Kael and whether he remains numb or feels—are clear and introduced early. Pressure escalates from verbal sparring to physical combat to the higher-stakes act of vivification, which narrows options and forces Kael into a costly emotional exposure. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively: he must risk feeling in order to win the existential battle. While the moral calculus isn’t deeply contested on the page (we don’t seriously consider the clone’s claim), the price of victory is legible and non-trivial.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will relate to the seed’s mystery—is clear but remains low-intensity. There is one main deepening: his analytical assault fails, forcing a move toward intuitive acceptance. However, pressure never truly tightens; there’s no substantial risk, deadline, or meaningful external constraint, so tension stays gentle throughout. The cost of his choice (relinquishing the urge to solve) is more idea-level than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving his daughter’s laughter to heal the household—is strong and present from early on. Escalation comes through intensifying effort, vibration, and the shift from imagined to bone-heard sound, culminating in the visual and auditory release. Opposition is largely passive (stone, silence), so there’s little reversal or complication beyond “harder, more insistent,” which keeps pressure a bit flatter than it could be. Still, his decision to keep pushing to the brink, then to cut the engine, reads as an earned, price-bearing culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Sylvan manages invasive certainty in a domain of cultivated uncertainty—is clearly established and tightened by the pendant’s arrival. Pressure escalates when the pendant’s “violation” clashes with his nature, provoking the temptation to shatter it versus his core vow to endure and internalize. His ultimate refusal to destroy the object, and instead to accept it as part of the garden, reads as an earned renunciation with a clear cost: he must accommodate a foreign truth within his own fabric. The conflict is purely internal and stays low-voltage in visceral terms, which limits intensity but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains a failure trapped in inherited expectations or forges a new vocation—remains legible, and the decision to destroy/vivify the crozier is an authentic pressure point. Yet escalation is mostly intellectual: the numbered approximations are announced rather than built as distinct, tightening beats with new risks or losses, so tension feels more conceptual than visceral. There is no real sense of what happens if he fails this time beyond continued malaise, so the cost of failure and success alike is muted. The final shift is satisfying but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can capture and interpret this anomalous signal—is clear but largely intellectual. Pressure does increase as the signal clarifies and he discards assumptions, yet there’s minimal sense of risk, loss, or narrowed options; failure would mostly mean a missed insight, not a palpable cost. The shift from “signal from beyond” to “signal from within the fragment” is a knowledge deepening but not a hard-earned tradeoff. As a result, tension remains gentle, closer to meditative curiosity than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—risking dimensional catastrophe to merge timelines—is stated, and there is a clear beat of increased pressure when the grotto strains and the ferry trembles. Yet the conflict is largely procedural; no one opposes Elijah, he encounters no real failure, and his confidence is never seriously tested. The “tightening” consists mostly of descriptive intensification rather than narrowed options or a painful trade-off. As a result, the outcome feels foregone and the cost of success barely grazes the story.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—can he transform illusions into reality by understanding connection—is clear and tested twice, with increasing emotional and conceptual pressure. The failed staircase attempt followed by the more vulnerable, chaotic corridor weaving provides a credible escalation and a meaningful turn. The cost is present but muted: his exhaustion, the loss of the thread, and the relinquishing of his purely controlled approach. Because the stakes are largely interior and never threaten more than his sense of purpose, tension remains thoughtful rather than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—teaching star navigation to a starless culture—is intriguing but stays almost entirely conceptual. There is no concrete on-page risk if the lesson fails, no opposition from students or institution, and no hard choice for Elias. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; once he begins the lesson, it unfolds smoothly to an inspiring close. As a result, the story reads as an atmospheric vignette rather than a scene under real strain.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Margaret’s unfinished truth to protect a silenced sister—is clear and thematically aligned. There is one significant tightening when the pulses suddenly intensify, signaling urgency and leading to the hidden compartment. But Aria experiences almost no resistance or risk; the investigation progresses linearly with no real possibility of failure or meaningful sacrifice. As a result, tension is modest and escalation feels more procedural than pressured, keeping the conflict below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Eliza remains embodied or joins the trapped consciousnesses—is conceptually strong but thinly contested. Her fear, history with claustrophobia, and mentor’s disappearance don’t produce much friction at the moment of choice; once the fleck syncs with the cables, the outcome feels almost inevitable. There is one clear deepening (fleck blazing as the tide turns, leading into dissolution), but little sense of options being weighed or lost on the page. Conflict is more atmospheric than confrontational, which blunts urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to reframe the accident and his survival, with a secondary pressure around Aris’s fragmented consciousness. Pressure does tighten when the ink forms the traumatic image of the atmospheric pulse, directly confronting him with the moment of divergence between their fates. However, escalation remains mostly emotional and relatively mild, with little sense of risk that anything could go wrong in the present ritual. The resolution—accepting survival as wisdom—feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether a “dead” language can be revived or transformed—is clear but mostly carried at the conceptual level. On the page, there is little resistance: Kaelen executes the method, and echoes respond; there is no failed attempt, pushback, or genuine risk that the canyon or diamond might be hostile or inert. The “curse” has already been reinterpreted in Kaelen’s mind before the scene’s main action, so the decisive conflict has largely happened offstage. As a result, escalation feels more like steadily intensifying description than a pressured narrowing of options with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will do with his grief and obsession, especially in relation to the Jester’s offer/threat—is clear and grows as he uncovers the arrowhead and then hears his sister reframed as “punchline.” Pressure escalates when the Jester begins to alter his emotional state, and again when Lyra enters with her own history and recognition of the arrowhead. The key turn is Elias choosing to drop the arrowhead, abandoning a revenge/containment trajectory for a more ambiguous engagement with healing. That cost, however, remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—using forbidden music to break the city’s mechanical domination and awaken beauty—is clear early and escalates from private grief to city-wide transformation. The arrival and advance of the living statues, and the city’s machinery reacting to her notes, provide a credible tightening. However, tension is undercut by how effortlessly her music overcomes both statues and machinery; there’s no real setback, sacrifice, or hard choice once she commits. The resolution is thematically satisfying but lacks a felt, on-page price that would deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—getting the tissue sample through a militarized border without triggering war—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is well-handled via the approaching drone zenith and three-second EMP window, giving a clear tightening of options. Kael’s agency directly drives the turn when he fires the “storm in a bottle” and shifts the parcel during the blackout. What holds this below top tier is the lack of a visible price or complication after success; the action works exactly as planned with no on-page backlash or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core stake—whether Elian remains bound to his chosen silence or opens himself to a reclaimed, risky voice—is present and reasonably clear. Escalation comes through the discovery of the impossible carriage and halo fragment, then the fragment’s pulsing resonance with the bells, which nudges him toward a decisive act. However, the conflict remains relatively soft; external opposition is minimal, and his internal struggle isn’t sharply tested before he yields to singing. The result is a satisfying but low-friction turn rather than a fully pressurized one.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—accessing the place where stories are truly alive—is clear but stays abstract, with little on-page friction or risk. Escalation is more a smooth deepening of wonder (geometry bends, portal appears, crossing) than a pressured narrowing of options, and she never seriously considers refusal or failure. The “price” of reawakening the library and herself is not dramatized as a trade-off; it reads as a pure gain. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a shared dream/wholeness to the archipelago—is signaled, but conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed. There is a minor tightening when “it wasn’t enough; he needed more,” prompting him to listen and press his palm to the palette, but this reads as a graceful next step rather than a pressured choice with alternatives. The dream responds on the first intensified attempt, with no visible risk of loss or failure. As a result, tension remains low and escalation feels more like a gentle swell than a test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—liberating joy from fear—is clear, and the fear’s "defense" via overwhelming scent, pressure, and disorientation creates an on-page tightening. However, the locksmith never seems in genuine danger of failing; his persistence is steady and untroubled, so the conflict escalates atmospherically more than morally or tactically. The internal articulation of the key insight ("enough") comes smoothly, without a prior failed attempt, reversal, or true dilemma. The result is satisfying but low-friction, limiting the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories/understanding why she’s drawn to reality-frayed places—remains clear, with a secondary stake in whether she’ll accept responsibility for thinning veils between worlds. There is some escalation: harmless-seeming observation shifts into bubbling water, emergent light-beings, and a revaluation of her entire life’s drive. However, the pressure never quite tightens into a hard choice; the beings’ request is accepted almost immediately, without a visible trade-off or real resistance. Conflict is more contemplative than fraught, which is fine for mood but keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus’s exile has produced the needed growth and whether he can return—is clear, but practically all tension is internal to Elara and largely resolved by the time he materializes. There is one modest tightening as she moves from anxious backward pacing to confident forward motion once the ritual succeeds. Because nothing on the page truly imperils the return, the conflict feels contemplative rather than pressured. The emotional cost is present but under-tested by concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (reviving the last Chroma Blossom to preserve wonder) is clearly signaled, but on-page pressure remains low: there is no active opposition, time constraint, or risk of failure beyond implication. Her process of gathering essence is beautifully described yet unchallenged; no tactic fails, and no option is foreclosed. As a result, escalation is more a gentle deepening of intensity than a tightening of stakes. The resolution is earned by her action but lacks a visible price or consequence that would sharpen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing and grounding the trapped fishermen’s spirits by confronting a buried communal secret—is clear, and the successive knots provide a nominal sense of escalation. However, Elias encounters little true resistance beyond the slightly “different” fourth and last knots; his success feels foregone, and no concrete option is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. The internal and ethical stakes (complicity in forced confinement vs. facing grief) are asserted but not truly tested by a hard decision, so tension plateaus rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering/reopening the whispered chapel and fulfilling his great-grandfather’s legacy—is clear but remains low-pressure and largely unopposed. Escalation is mostly procedural: aligning videos, finding the distortion, performing the ritual, then recognizing patterns; there’s no meaningful risk of failure, moral dilemma, or external obstruction. Elias’s agency is present but not truly tested, and no options are visibly foreclosed by his success. The result is interesting and evocative but more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Elias can find a way to “understand” and thus manage letting go—emerges clearly and is tightened through the increasingly stark transmissions. The third, purely-violent scream is an effective escalation that collapses his working model and forces a new stance. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and cerebral, with little sense that he risks anything beyond a change in worldview; his decision to stop feels consequential but not sharply priced. A slightly stronger sense of what he loses or forecloses by abandoning the quest would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—completing the encoded message before the storm-window closes—is signaled, but its consequences remain conceptual rather than felt. Escalation exists mainly as time pressure and a shift from calm focus to “almost frantic yet remaining precise” work. There is no genuine reversal or meaningful narrowing of options beyond “finish now or wait for next time,” so the piece reads as largely conflict-light and accumulative. As a result, the ending feels more like fulfillment of a plan than a hard-won outcome with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict remains mostly internal and fairly low-grade: anticipation vs dread about the summons, and the race between the climbing elevator and decoding the diary. The discovery of her being “prepared” by the author reweights her situation but doesn’t force a difficult choice; she simply steps forward into the legacy with no explicit alternative path or sacrifice. The elevator’s approach to the tenth floor offers a nominal ticking clock, yet nothing truly bad threatens to happen if she fails to finish reading. As a result, pressure escalates mildly in knowledge terms but never bites in terms of cost or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to prove that emptiness has memory—is clear, and the gondola’s peril offers an implicit external stake. But the piece largely ignores the physical danger; he never meaningfully weighs survival against observation, and the gondola’s eventual safe landing feels incidental rather than hard-won. The one tightening—his decision to “categorize the clouds anew” and name them after the break—deepens theme but doesn’t really foreclose options or introduce cost. As a result, pressure accumulates atmospherically rather than as true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—creating the impossible sky before demolition and, internally, finding a purpose that fits his way of seeing—is legible from early on. Pressure does rise as the demolition crew nears and the wrecking ball strikes, but there is no real on-page jeopardy to his success or meaningful trade-off forced under time pressure. The external conflict functions more as backdrop than as a tightening vise, so escalation feels conceptual rather than viscerally testing his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will transform from obscure apprentice to revolutionary cartographer—is clear but remains mostly internal and aspirational. Escalation is primarily intellectual: recognition that the board is a navigation system and that the starlings reveal stranded luminance. There’s no opposing force, decision with real downside, or concrete test of his resolve; covering the board and planning to present it is frictionless. The piece feels like a beautifully rendered “aha” moment more than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can truly grasp the “rhythm of repair” and heal temporal/emotional fractures—is clear, but on-page pressure is gentle. The eruption of mirror images and blinding light is the main escalation, yet she never seriously doubts, fails, or pays a steep price; she “worked quickly” and succeeds on the first attempt. Internal and external conflicts track each other, but they don’t quite force a charged trade-off or renunciation. As a result, tension feels more ceremonial than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes (planetary habitability; whether the settlers become true caretakers) are high in concept but remain mostly abstract and unpressured in scene. The ghost’s plan unfolds with very little resistance or genuine risk; each discovery comes smoothly once the pattern is recognized. There is one key tightening—learning the bells sustain the atmosphere—but it arrives as explanation rather than as a hard choice with immediate cost. The story lacks a beat where someone must sacrifice, doubt, or genuinely risk loss to honor the Gardener’s design.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes—whether anything of humanity’s beauty survives the end of time—are enormous and clearly stated, with pressure building as the “final ripple” approaches and the mechanism slows. His decision to go beyond orders and fuse the puppet with the pane constitutes a real turn that alters the outcome. However, the conflict stays largely conceptual and meditative; there’s little sense of genuine risk that he might fail or choose otherwise. The emotional and ethical cost of defiance is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—save the traveler from the labyrinth and birds before the curse claims another victim—is clear from the outset. Pressure escalates via the birds detecting motion, the assembling of a risky device, and the time pressure of the descending frost line. Tomas’s agency drives the outcome: his construction and air-impressions both enable the traveler’s escape and confuse the birds at visible cost (frostbite, continued bondage to the orchard). Internal conflict is present but doesn’t quite peak into a sharp moral or emotional dilemma, keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Marco’s health versus her contractual obligations and self-concept—are clear and morally charged. Tension accumulates internally as she wrestles with guilt and searches for a bridge between opposing goods. However, conflict remains mostly contemplative; there’s little sense of time pressure, external pushback, or real risk once she conceives the workaround. The ethical calculus is strong, but the lack of on-page resistance or sacrifice keeps escalation relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes—surrendering memories and becoming a “clean slate”—are inherently high, but on the page the decisions happen quickly with little resistance or moral friction. The second incising scene largely repeats the first without raising the emotional or ethical cost for Elias or the clients. Elias’s own long-term stake (finding where stories begin) never comes under real pressure from the immediate work he’s doing. As a result, tension is more conceptual than visceral, and escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s attempt to blunt his specific guilt at the risk of taking on vast, impersonal suffering—is clear, and the move from fortress to pavilion is a meaningful tightening. However, opposition remains largely notional: the hinted threat of “those searching for him” never manifests, and the pavilion offers no real resistance. The subsumption act occurs without a concrete test, trade-off, or visible aftermath beyond a summarized “dull ache,” so tension doesn’t peak as sharply as it could. The result is a strong conceptual conflict but a relatively gentle on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving grain elevator talks to rebuild community—is articulated, but on-page pressure remains low and largely uncontested. Tonight is framed as a culmination, yet nothing in the scene truly threatens failure or forces a trade-off; calibration and broadcast unfold smoothly. The main tightening is conceptual (moving from solitary broadcasts to mutual signals and eventual agreements) rather than experiential. As a result, escalation under the accumulative lens is gentle and textural rather than gripping, limiting the felt cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—accessing and potentially reshaping humanity’s abandoned potential—is stated at a grand scale but rarely made tangible in scene. Almost no antagonistic pressure or risk challenges her; once the sequence is activated, everything works and continues to work. The main tightening is simply the transition from theory to direct experience of the dreamscape, which doesn’t foreclose options or demand a trade-off. As a result, tension stays largely conceptual, and the ending doesn’t carry a sharp sense of price or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high (restore balance to a myopic world), but on-page conflict is gentle and almost entirely uncontested; once she decodes the map, everything unfolds without real obstacles or reversals. The main “tightening” is the timed window of gravity inversion, yet this clock doesn’t generate concrete dilemmas or forced trade-offs in scene. Internal and external pressures don’t meaningfully clash—she wants something, goes to get it, and gets it. Stronger resistance (from the grotto, the seeds, or her own fears) or a tough choice would substantially deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Eliara can coax music from a broken, long-silent sculpture—is clear but only lightly pressured. There is a gentle escalation from analysis to tentative strumming to fuller song, yet there’s no serious risk of failure, no counter-force beyond generalized time and “silence,” and no alternative path she might take. The story functions more as a lyrical unveiling than a test of commitment or values, so the emotional cost and narrowing of options feel minimal. This keeps tension present but mild and largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will cling to hope of reinstatement or accept exile as a new vocation—is legible and resolved. There is one clear deepening when his hope for reinstatement “faded into acceptance,” but the pressure feels relatively gentle, and the “before the next phase” clock doesn’t truly force a trade-off or sacrifice. Internal and external frames (political exile, cosmic ritual) interweave in theme, yet the conflict never faces a sharp on-page test or reversal. The result is contemplative and satisfying, but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the diary before the fireworks shatter the unique silence—is clear, but the consequence of failure remains largely conceptual and low-pressure. There is a modest escalation as different “silence frequencies” are tried and time runs short, culminating in a breakthrough intuition about the presence within silence. However, there’s no genuine reversal or serious threat to Silen’s goal; the plan evolves linearly rather than being tested or endangered. The final success feels earned in idea-space but emotionally low-cost, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure remains almost entirely internal and fairly soft; there’s no serious possibility that the flower will fail, harm the village, or cost Elara something she’s reluctant to pay. The dominant stake—finding serenity/wisdom through cultivating the corpse flower—never encounters a concrete obstacle or counterforce beyond the passage of time. The mild social tension (villagers’ whispers vs. admiration) is noted but not dramatized into scenes that force her to defend or question her path. As a result, escalation is more a gentle deepening of ritual than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the source of the orchard’s resilience and what it might mean for wider agriculture—is clear but stays abstractly intellectual. There is a meaningful deepening when the arrow tip’s power is revealed and mirrored in the core tree, shifting the premise from innate resilience to learned adaptation. However, external pressure is low: the gravity window, potential danger, and ethical stakes never truly force a trade-off or difficult choice; Kael never has to risk or relinquish anything in pursuit of discovery. The conflict reads more as a well-paced tour of wonders than as escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what silenced seventeen thousand people—is high and signaled early, and the escalation from routine survey to discovering a biochemical agent and dispersal system is structurally sound. Yet the conflict remains largely intellectual; there’s no active antagonist, no urgent counterforce, and Elias never faces a sharp trade-off or moral calculus on the page. As a result, tension feels more like steadily deepening explanation than mounting, choice-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder is “essential”—remains largely abstract and unopposed, so tension is low. Escalation is mostly a steady thickening of imagery and volume rather than a sharpened dilemma or narrowing of options; nothing on the page threatens the bell ringer’s goal. The ice’s response arrives without genuine resistance or reversal, muting the sense of risk or price paid at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking another catastrophic failure versus remaining paralyzed by past defeat—is clearly signaled and tied to the act of uncasing and playing the flute. The internal conflict escalates from preparation and dread to actually stepping into the consequence realm and facing specific branching outcomes of prior decisions. However, the danger of the act remains somewhat abstract; the entity, possible re-breach, or personal annihilation are not sharply felt in the moment of choice. As a result, the escalation feels more contemplative than pressured, limiting the intensity of perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Silas’s stance toward emotion—maintain analytic distance and borrowed selves or risk genuine, overwhelming empathy by merging with the halo. Pressure does escalate as the fragment synchronizes with the workshop and begins printing unsolicited equations, culminating in his choice to press it into his chest and accept collective connection. However, resistance is minimal; there’s little sense of credible alternative or real attempt to maintain his old modus operandi before surrendering, so the turn feels somewhat smooth. The vanishing stars and cosmic forgetting suggest huge stakes, but they rarely constrain his on-page tactics or choices beyond tone.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether the courier can shift from merely carrying relics to actively extending wonder and legacy through his pendant. Escalation comes via stronger pendant responses and the hermit’s deeper exposition, culminating in the courier’s new stance, but there’s little external or on-page cost; the delivery goal and physical danger remain soft. The storm and the mysterious hermit provide situational pressure, yet the courier is rarely forced into a difficult trade-off or sacrifice. As a result, tension feels steady rather than tightening, and the “price” of his new understanding remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully commune with emotional residues in objects—is clear, but escalation is more a smooth intensification of sensation than a pressured narrowing of options. The tremor in the prism and descent of the “shifted hush” function as a single meaningful deepening, but Elias doesn’t face a hard choice or visible trade-off in the moment. His agency is primarily in initiating and enduring the experience, then deciding that private conviction is enough. The conflict remains relatively static and contemplative, limiting tension despite strong mood.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sending a message across an ontological barrier—is clear and the pressure increases as she commits to more painful, sacrificial weaving against the “raveling silence.” Her physical cost (bleeding, collapse, exhaustion) and the risk of being claimed by the void give the attempt some bite. Still, the opposition remains somewhat vague, and the outcome of the first contact is soft, which dulls the sense of a truly narrowed set of options.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—whether Elias can create a resilient, remembering arch—exists and culminates in success, with his personal transformation tied to that outcome. However, on-page resistance is minimal: once he starts, the ritual proceeds over “hours” with no failure, interruption, or real risk besides implied exhaustion and prior monetary cost. The world’s indifference and his secrecy function more as background than active pressure, so tension never truly tightens. The result is quietly satisfying but low in felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the erased truth of the Chimera incident and, by extension, Kael’s own history—is clear and significant. There is one real tightening: once in the past, he must act subtly and quickly before the shard pulls him back, and redirecting the log is a concrete, consequential choice. Yet the scene faces almost no resistance; the engineer is oblivious, security protocols don’t push back, and the “cyclically spontaneous” constraint never tests his resolve. As a result, tension feels more conceptual than visceral, and the price of success reads as relatively low-stress on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stakes—relight the lamp and navigate his loneliness via the unseen correspondent—are clear, but external conflict is almost frictionless. The main escalation is emotional: the lantern room’s “luminescent ache,” the warming sea glass, and his realization that the letter writer “was here—had always been here,” culminating in his decision to leave the glass and stone pattern. This does produce a meaningful tightening of his internal conflict, yet there is little sense that he might fail or that any option is truly closed off. As a result, the story is affecting but low-pressure, more meditative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how Kaelen’s subtle steering shapes humanity’s path—is thematically interesting but never comes under acute on-page pressure. There is minimal escalation: storms “approach,” prophecies grow more frequent, but no single night or choice feels riskier than the rest, and no option is sharply foreclosed. As a result, the conflict reads as static contemplation rather than a tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the donor’s legacy and how to live this “second life”—is clear and internal, and pressure coheres around his ritualized investigation. Escalation arrives accumulatively via weeks of mapping sun trails, culminating in the refracted beam and sensory ‘detonation’ that forces a stance on how he’ll live. The cost (relinquishing the quest for the donor’s specific story in favor of embodying their attentiveness) is legible but remains philosophical rather than sharply dramatized. Tension is refined and quiet rather than gripping, which suits the piece but keeps stakes from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—Elian uncovering what trees witness—is coherent, but there is little opposition beyond time and secrecy from administrators that never comes under direct strain. Escalation exists structurally (from incidental observation to deliberate experiment in a storm) yet remains low-intensity; nothing significant is at risk of loss or harm if the experiment fails. The breakthrough arrives without a moment where Elian must sacrifice, decide against a competing good, or risk real consequence. As a result, tension is more contemplative than fraught, capping conflict and stakes in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and followed through to the end, with a clear tightening as the music intensifies and the town begins to respond. Pressure is mostly internal (can he succeed this time?) and situational (a realm on the brink), but little on-page resistance or real possibility of failure complicates his attempt. The prior failed attempt is mentioned but not leveraged into a meaningful on-page test that forces a trade-off. As a result, escalation is present but relatively smooth, with limited sense of cost beyond fatigue and long-held burden.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core conflict—whether to attend the Convergence or remain in refuge—is clearly signaled early and remains the dominant stake. Pressure accumulates more through reflection and thematic framing than through concrete obstacles or reversals, and there is essentially one turn: from reluctance to acceptance. The emotional and ethical costs are asserted (overwhelm, empathic overload) but not tested or escalated in-scene, which keeps tension relatively soft. As a result, the decision lands, but without the sharper sense of narrowed options or loss that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes are internal: whether Elara can find meaning and absolution in a quietly decaying world and whether her small acts matter. Pressure tightens at the baker’s reveal (“I baked that”) which forces her to confront misperception (vanished vs stopped) and the possibility that her anchor is contingent and human, not mystical. However, the conflict never bites very hard—no serious alternative path or loss is foregrounded beyond the loaf’s consumption and persistent loneliness. The escalation is graceful but muted, more contemplative than truly testing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the vows’ meanings before the Great Forgetting—is clearly signaled, and the fading luminosity provides a nominal ticking clock. Yet on the page, there’s little real resistance: no measurements fail, no near-loss, no choice that might sacrifice one vow for another or pit duty against self-preservation. The only escalation is the dimming library and “two vows left,” which reads as a mild intensification rather than a turn that forecloses options. As a result, tension is present in concept but soft in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing Silas from trading the market’s freedom for his own, under a ticking sunrise deadline—is clearly signaled and carried through. Conflict escalates via the two failed approaches and recognition by Silas/guard, narrowing Emmie’s options and forcing the higher-risk diversion gambit. Internal stakes (her father’s murder, her role in this community) are present but somewhat under-exploited as direct sources of on-page friction. The final cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the pressure arc reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elara’s need to understand her condition and find kin—but it’s never put under real pressure: there’s no serious possibility of failure, misrecognition, or rejection once the ring activates. Escalation is primarily atmospheric (stronger tastes, brighter lights, more charged language) rather than conflictual, and the other carrier arrives as a benign answer rather than a source of friction. Her skepticism “cracks” without any on-page struggle where contrary impulses collide; the rain-memory moment is beautiful but not contested. Overall, tension stays low and the cost of change is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether he will remain entombed in self-denial or accept his vocation—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates from passive ache to active risk when he opens the painting and chooses to draw again, culminating in the decision to leave the cave. That said, there is minimal genuine resistance once he starts sketching; the process is intense but not seriously contested, so the conflict curve feels relatively gentle. The story would benefit from at least one concrete moment where his fear of cruelty nearly halts or distorts his return to art.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether truth about the poisoned oasis will surface and how it will reshape the city—emerges early and tightens as Elara’s discoveries implicate the council and then Marius personally. The wilting trait adds real pressure to every interaction, culminating in the confrontation where she forces a confession. Her final choice to disseminate the withheld conversations, knowing the pain and destabilization it will cause, reads as a genuine trade-off. What’s missing is a sharper sense of immediate peril or pushback to her decision, which keeps the escalation from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can successfully release and preserve the “color of wonder” through this one sculpture—is present but largely untested. The main tightening is the activation of the mechanism and the fragment beginning to melt, culminating in the sense that its “truth” is fully released and his work here is finished. There is minimal resistance or risk of failure; nothing meaningfully threatens the process, so tension stays low and largely conceptual. His decision to leave the bluff reads more as ritual closure than a pressured choice with visible alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal (L-734’s psychic integrity) with a strong symbolic external echo (survival of the roses and facility), and the need to act by dawn under the magnetic pivot gives a clear ticking clock. Escalation tracks through increasing static, failing roses, and the decision to risk total burn, but the sense of potential irreversible loss remains more conceptual than visceral. The final act—the controlled burn and integration—reads as a successful, almost clean win with minimal felt downside beyond what’s implied. Pressure is coherent, but sharp on-page cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mrs. Leclair’s absence and the mailbox mystery will resolve into loss or communal healing—is present but lightly pressured. Elias is never seriously thwarted; neighbors readily supply clues, the notes point cleanly to the next step, and there’s no real risk of failure or misinterpretation. Internal conflict (his need to prove that listening heals vs. fear of intruding or being wrong) is implied but not dramatized in specific moments. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth unfolding than a narrowing of options with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (freeing the mentor’s consciousness before self-destruction/guards intervene) is clearly signaled, and the spider-web countdown provides a built-in tightening mechanism. Her agency drives resolution through continued decryption-dance rather than combat or flight, which is coherent with the story’s ethos. Yet there’s no true reversal or meaningful cost: the guards pose almost no real obstacle, the dice provide the exact sequence needed, and the bomb threat evaporates the instant she succeeds. The conflict feels more like a smooth execution of a plan than a test that genuinely narrows her options or forces a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—regaining lost memories—is clearly signaled and pursued, and the pressure does deepen as Elara leaves the safety of routine to trespass in the institute and work inside a wildly fluctuating gravity pocket. However, the dangers remain mostly conceptual; beyond an early near-fall and some turbulent lantern motion, the ritual proceeds with little real jeopardy or hard trade-off. There is one meaningful tightening (entering the chamber and initiating the ritual) but no strong reversal. The resolution feels earned but relatively untested by on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the prophecy’s sound-weapon will be neutralized—is signaled, but it never feels precarious on the page. There is essentially one pressure point (the wing lifting and transforming into a sphere), yet the text does not allow for meaningful doubt, resistance, or cost in that moment. Conflict is almost wholly internal and contemplative, but even internally his resolve is unwavering, so escalation reads as steady amplification of imagery rather than tightening of options. As a result, the resolution feels more like a foregone consummation than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The main pressure—whether she will reveal the truth about the seal and the buildings to Elias—is clear and does tighten when he presses about “the lies” and the environment literally shifts. However, resistance is minimal: once the magic starts, there’s no genuine risk that she’ll re-conceal or lose anything by sharing. The meteors and glowing seal escalate texture more than stakes, so the resolution feels smooth rather than costly. Effective tension, but not yet at a level of real trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elena can safely integrate quarantined memories and transform isolation into independence—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates texturally as memories move from birthday to hospital room to argument in the rain, and as the network of crystals nears completion. However, the sense of risk (bleeding through the quarantine, danger of overwhelm) is mostly told and never quite bites on the page; success feels almost assured once she commits. The final “archivist” walk is conceptually strong but low in immediate tension or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—exposing Lord Valerius and reclaiming her family’s legacy at great personal risk—are conceptually high, and the story signals them clearly. Yet on the page, conflict remains mostly internal and low-friction: no one interrupts, nothing goes wrong with the forgery, and there’s no concrete sign of danger as she moves through the plan. The main “tightening” is essentially the act of finally writing and sealing the document, which deepens commitment but doesn’t foreclose competing options in a visceral way. The ending choice to deliver the document is thematically charged but feels almost inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—forcing the truth about the Spire’s corruption and impending collapse into public hearing—is clear and escalates as he shifts from solitary listening to city-wide broadcast, culminating in tremors and visible disruption. However, opposition is entirely offstage and never adapts; nothing pushes back in the moment besides abstract “webs of intrigue,” so pressure feels one-directional. Kaelen’s agency is to persist in singing and weave in the engineers’ voices, but his choice isn’t meaningfully contested or narrowed, and the cost to him is more implied than dramatized. This keeps tension solid but not gripping for a “prestige” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are meaningful—thirty-two dead, corporate negligence, the moral duty to the drowned—but pressure rarely tightens on the page. Elara encounters little resistance; once she sees Nikolaus and decides to act, the director’s conversion is rapid and untroubled, with no concrete risk, trade-off, or near-failure. The dreams becoming “more frantic” is told rather than dramatized through escalating obstacles. The conflict functions, yet feels too easy and low-friction for the scale of the harm.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s desire to discern and honor hidden patterns—is clear but low-pressure. Her choice to leave her sanctuary and follow the fireflies is a form of agency, yet nothing on the page meaningfully opposes or threatens her; the fireflies cooperate, the city offers no danger, and the workshop yields exactly what she hopes. As a result, escalation is more a gentle unfolding than a tightening, and the “price” of insight feels almost entirely frictionless. This keeps the conflict framework functional but too safe for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true nature of the orchard and the diamond versus the official story—is present and clarified over time. The main tightening is Maya’s discovery and reconstruction of the letters leading to her reinterpretation of OmniGen’s collapse. Yet there is almost no antagonistic force or live risk on the page; no one pushes back, and nothing materially threatens her as she investigates. As a result, tension remains mostly intellectual, with limited sense of trade-off or immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elias aligns with the old order, Maren’s “pure light,” or some third path—are clear, and the prophecy that “The observatory will fall, or the prophet shall” signals a real pressure point. Yet the escalation is mostly internal and reflective, with limited on-page resistance or complication; he adjusts the frequencies and the problem resolves without visible pushback. The cost is essentially leaving his observatory and anonymity, which is thematically meaningful but under-dramatized. As a result, tension is present but not as tight or sharp as the premise implies.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas’s life can have purpose through preservation of ephemeral and forgotten things—is clear but relatively low-heat. The music box discovery is the main pressure point, prompting a redefinition of his work rather than a conflict with real alternatives or risks. Subsequent “escalation” (tourists bringing artifacts, the elderly woman’s recognition) is more validation than test; there’s little sense of what he must give up or what might be lost if he fails. As a result, tension remains gentle and contemplative rather than tightening toward a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared large (protecting a creation-singing artifact from human greed), but the on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and largely uncontested. The engineer’s choice to use sonic absolution over force is treated as fait accompli, and once the ritual begins, nothing meaningfully threatens its success—no reversal, no intensified opposition, no sacrifice beyond exertion. As a result, tension plateaus quickly, and the ending confirms what was never truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can trigger a “patient revolution” by exploiting rare lunar/magnetic conditions—is signaled early but remains largely abstract. Pressure accumulates in a conceptual sense (three lunar cycles, mapping the pattern), yet there is no on-page setback, opposition, or moral trade-off when she finally acts. Once the pattern is found, execution is smooth, so escalation is more informational than experiential. The resolution is earned but not hard-won, which blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—solving a suspicious death linked to her father and freeing herself from inherited control—are clear, but conflict remains largely internal and contemplative. Externally, nothing actively pushes back; the “case” is never made difficult in the moment, and the only on-page “tightening” is the inscription’s discovery. Her final decision to keep going and reinterpret her father’s role is meaningful but not sharply contested by any live opposing force. Tension hums rather than climbs, leaving the climax emotionally modest relative to the thematic weight claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing a posthumous murder/desecration and Elias’s own complicity—is clear and sharpened by the “reversal” revelation. There is one meaningful escalation when Anja explains the trigger and delayed stopping, transforming the heart from ominous curiosity to active threat. However, after that turn, the conflict resolves very smoothly; Anja disarms the device without complication, resistance, or visible risk, so pressure doesn’t truly tighten. The ethical dimension is interesting, but the on-page danger feels more theoretical than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Zephyr’s need to locate and eventually ring the Silent Bell—is signaled clearly, and the arrow/kaleidoscope sequence is a genuine deepening of knowledge. Yet escalation is largely informational: nothing meaningfully opposes Zephyr on the page, and no option is visibly foreclosed; the yearning algorithm simply continues to succeed. The overseer’s warning (“what even the First Makers feared to sound”) hints at danger but never materializes as present-tense pressure that tests Zephyr’s resolve. Without a concrete reversal or cost, tension feels more anticipatory than actively sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and then exposing an engineered erasure that protects an empire—is clear and escalates conceptually from curiosity to revolution. Elias’s actions drive the key turns, and the final choice to broadcast is a genuine point of no return. However, antagonistic pressure is almost entirely offstage: no direct resistance, no concrete threat in the moment of choice, so tension reads more intellectual than visceral. The conflict functions well but stops short of fully felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing dimensional bleed and answering “what comes next” to preserve balance—is stated early and returns at the end, and the “weighted breath” offers a nominal time pressure. But on the page, Shael encounters no real resistance: each mirror cooperates, there are no false paths or costs to choosing certain visions, and success never feels in doubt. The internal conflict around what answer to give (“Equality”) is sketched rather than dramatized, so escalation is intellectual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Arthur can discern and bear the “sound” of endings—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure deepens as he shifts from sterile, individualized death (Zurich clinic) to collective disaster and finally to the communal song, which forces a stance on what endings mean. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that he might choose otherwise in the moment, and no concrete external consequence tests his new understanding. The escalation is thematically satisfying but relatively low in felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether Lila and Marc will lose or salvage their relationship—is legible but under-pressured. We never see a concrete reason for their estrangement, nor any real resistance once the letter appears, so tension doesn’t meaningfully escalate; it mostly dissipates. The sentinel’s interventions succeed without facing a plausible chance of failure or visible trade-off. As a result, the conflict feels more like a gentle reset than a tested, costly turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of wisdom before forgetful sands erase it—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the echo urges him to preserve “truth within” and he re-consecrates at greater cost. Yet the pressure does not markedly escalate; entropy and the parapet’s dwindling energy never corner him into a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice beyond mild exertion and the mechanism’s depletion. The conflict feels largely ceremonial and one-sided, with no real possibility of failure or alternative path dramatized on the page. Tension exists but stays muted and conceptual rather than viscerally sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest to transform individual pain into a meaningful, collective pattern—is clear, but the on-page pressure around it is modest. The main escalation is the day’s work coalescing into a visible pattern and mural, a deepening of meaning rather than a forced trade-off. There’s little sense of potential failure, opposition, or sacrifice beyond continued devotion, which keeps the conflict thoughtful but low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal and conceptual: can he extract and understand a pattern from the death of language, and what stance will he take toward that end? Escalation is subtle but present under an accumulative lens: moving from “Growth” to “Silence” drastically intensifies the sensory and emotional impact, culminating in a “cascade of collapsing sounds” that forces a revaluation of his goal. His final choice—to stop probing, accept the geometry of decay, and become witness rather than analyst—narrows his path, but the price of this renunciation remains largely conceptual and could be rendered more viscerally. There’s no external opposition, yet tension at the sentence and beat level keeps the piece from feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can pin down an echo of aging before it slips from his damaged mind—is clear but stays largely internal and conceptual. There is one solid tightening beat when he forgets his purpose in the fog and must be re-anchored by the chalk, and another as he identifies the “nexus” at the monolith. Yet the story never fully sharpens the consequences of failure beyond generalized longing, so pressure rises in atmosphere more than in concrete cost. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are explicitly high (the observatory’s destruction) and the tremors and spinning clock establish real pressure. Escalation exists—tremors worsen, tools fall, lights flicker—culminating in the violent shudder as Kael makes his adjustments. However, there is little real resistance or setback; once the “leaf sound” solution appears, implementation feels almost frictionless, and the cost is mainly physical strain and tension. The conflict thus reads more as a well-executed task than a deeply contested fight with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—giving Mr. Hale a meaningful, musically rooted goodbye—is legible and emotionally grounded. There is one main deepening when the shard leads to the box and the realization of the preserved twin record, raising the weight of the unfinished arrangement. However, tension is low and fairly static; nothing seriously threatens Elijah’s aim once he enters the room. The resolution arrives without a significant trade-off or narrowing of options, so escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding and controlling the shadow phenomenon as a step toward mending the world—is clear from the outset and escalates as the shadows physically invade. The key tightening beat is the realization that “the loops are not closed,” which ties her abstract method directly to imminent danger and forces a decisive act. External (shadow entity) and internal (drive for knowledge vs. danger) conflicts dovetail well, even if the moral ambiguity of harming exiled beings is only lightly gestured at. The price of her choice is implied more than viscerally felt, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—how Eleanor will respond to the substitute body’s message and what she will do with the tooth—is clear but gently pressured. There is one meaningful tightening when the child asks for the tooth and identifies herself as “the mistake that must become part of the pattern,” but Eleanor’s hesitation is fleeting and the trade-off feels largely symbolic. External stakes about “bones setting incorrectly between worlds” are gestured at rather than dramatized in a way that would sharpen tension. As a result, conflict is present and coherent but never bites as hard as the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling her promise to share celestial light without fire—is clear but faces little resistance once the scene begins; she already has the method, object, and opportunity. There’s a mild tightening as the glass moves from dull shard to glowing “pearl of stillness,” but no genuine alternative path or risk that might derail her goal. Internal hesitation or doubt is minimal, so tension remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic. This keeps conflict functional but not compelling at a competitive-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict—Elara’s need to remain protected versus being recognized and judged again—is clearly established and tightened when Maya identifies her and invokes the online mockery. The key escalation comes when Elara chooses to remove and offer the pendant, risking ridicule and re-wounding in order to connect. The emotional cost is present but handled gently; the scene could benefit from one sharper moment of genuine risk or internal resistance before she acts. Still, the progression from solitary refuge to shared, precarious connection is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can move past block and fulfill this new role as collector of hopes—is established, but escalation is gentle. His agency shows in choosing to attend to and “solemnize” each figure, yet every attempt succeeds without real risk or sacrifice, and there’s no beat where he genuinely might fail or refuse. The external micro-stake of losing the ephemeral figures to the current is declared, but never tests him beyond stepping forward and saying the ritual words. As a result, the resolution feels more like an inevitable fulfillment of a rule than a hard-won turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is clear, and the piece does tighten mildly as the cricket awakens and the moon’s glow intensifies. Yet there is no real resistance, risk, or alternative path; every step works as intended, so tension remains abstract rather than visceral. Elias never faces a meaningful choice that could foreclose a path in the moment, and the outcome feels preordained by the “when everything aligns” premise. The result is atmospheric rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully capturing and preserving the heartbeat-map during the rare alignment—is legible but never feels in doubt, so escalation remains mostly conceptual. The one tightening is temporal and situational (the once-in-forty-three-years window while the world holds its breath), but no on-page reversal, setback, or meaningful trade-off narrows Kaelen’s options. His agency is present in careful, deliberate actions rather than risky choice points. The result is textured ritual rather than true conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder before it vanishes—is conceptually strong but remains largely abstract in the moment-to-moment action. Pressure does increase slightly as we near the wounded season’s “deepest quiet,” and the first test has a brief breath of uncertainty before it works. However, Elian never faces a meaningful risk of loss, reversal, or trade-off; his expertise glides through the problem without real friction. The result is a beautifully imagined but relatively low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—the cost of calcifying and trapping herself in order to carry immense burdens—is conceptually strong but weakly dramatized. Elara makes no serious attempt to resist, delay, or test alternatives once in the grotto; pressure is mostly implied rather than enacted. The main escalation is temporal (the starlight reaching its zenith), yet this does not create visible dilemma so much as mark when the inevitable occurs. As a result, the ending feels earned in concept but under-pressured in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how she lives with and shapes grief—is clear, and her disciplined carving practice gives some pressure. However, the escalation is modest: the kettle-as-clock and the carving’s progress don’t strongly foreclose options or force a sharper trade-off; she is never in danger of choosing not to carve. The one meaningful deepening lies in the recognition of her craft as analogous to Tomas’s lion-taming, which enriches but doesn’t significantly raise stakes. The quiet Earned Stasis works, but the conflict stays relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains trapped in self-erasing regret or moves toward a self-owned future—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. There is one meaningful deepening when he recognizes the stories aren’t for the ghost, but much of the piece circles similar emotional ground without sharp escalations or new dilemmas. The lagoon’s “cage vs. rhythm” reframe at the end provides a conceptual shift rather than a hard trade-off or loss. As a result, the conflict feels thoughtful yet relatively low-pressure, with limited sense of what he truly risks by changing or not changing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract—“equations for hope” and a better future—without a concrete on-page consequence for failure in this moment. The conflict is mostly environmental inertia (dust, rust, a stiff valve) and never escalates beyond mild resistance; once she starts, success feels assured. There’s no significant trade-off, sacrifice, or narrowed path at the climax. As a result, tension is low and the story reads as a graceful unveiling rather than a test.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian continues living as a man who has forsaken his music or allows it back into his identity—is clear but very gently pressured. His avoidance of the forecourt sets up a potential conflict, yet once he chooses to go, there is little escalation or reversal; each step (listening, humming, accepting) flows without real resistance or visible price. The internal shift is meaningful but comes without a moment where he risks something tangible or must choose between competing harms. As a result, tension remains low, even for a quiet literary story.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will dismantle or be redefined by the legend—is clearly signaled, and the deepening occurs when he hauls up the chest and confronts the non-treasure within. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but the external salvage presents little resistance; there’s no substantial reversal or complication once he “feels” the wagon. The emotional cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, so tension runs more as low, steady pressure than a tightening noose. This works for a quiet piece but keeps escalation in the solid rather than exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to the weavers’ secrets to preserve forgotten knowledge—is signaled, but it’s never seriously threatened in-scene. Elias encounters no real resistance: he decodes knots without setback, the weaver appears because he succeeds, and she accepts him without demanding a painful trade-off. There is a mild deepening when the rope animates and its meanings imprint on him, but no reversal or forced choice that forecloses another path. As a result, tension stays meditative rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: Elias’s attempt to reconcile his calling (writing for the living) with the island’s and gardener’s long-term losses, and his own isolation as the last visitor. Pressure coheres but remains gentle; the primary “tightening” is his decision to focus on the gardener and complete the piece, rather than a moment where he must give something up or choose between incompatible goods. The ending registers as an earned stance—embracing presence despite loneliness—yet the price is mostly conceptual, not dramatized through a concrete trade-off. As a result, tension is consistently interesting but never truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sacrificing the suspended refuge to restore lost life—is clear early and honored at the end, and the activation of the device functions as a meaningful tightening that forecloses retreat. The cost (Kael’s death, destruction of the palace) is explicit and heavy. However, conflict is mostly internal and somewhat pre-decided; there is little on-page opposition beyond the palace’s ambient “scream,” and Kael encounters no true obstacle or temptation once he begins. As a result, escalation feels more like an inevitable ritual than a pressured struggle, which limits the sense of tactical adaptation and hard-earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reframing her inherited legacy and affirming that “scars could sing”—is clear but encounters almost no opposing pressure. Planting the sapling and tying the coin proceed without obstacle, ethical friction, or time constraint; the “work” is meditative rather than contested. As a result, escalation is essentially a deepening of reflection rather than a tightening of options, and no meaningful path is foreclosed on the page. The quiet mode is permissible, but a single concrete resistance (external or internal) would significantly raise the sense of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can open the box and what it will cost him internally—is signaled early and resolved clearly. Pressure accumulates via the box’s growing heaviness and warmth and the sense of finite time embodied by the geese’s migration, but the journey unfolds with almost no genuine resistance or hard choice. The main tightening is at the sapling when past and present fuse and he must confront what opening the box really means. Because conflict is mostly contemplative and unopposed, the stakes feel meaningful but never truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—organic, generational chaos versus cold, quantifying logic—is clear, and the gear’s appearance is a credible inciting disruption. Pressure escalates modestly as the sentimentalist moves toward the garden’s center, the sonar pinging aligns with the garden’s sighs, and the gear’s glow/rotation intensify before the integration choice. The decisive act (placing the gear and using light rather than destroying it) forecloses the old purely-organic pattern and introduces a new order with cost, but the tension remains cerebral and lyrical rather than sharply acute, so the stakes never feel fully urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s search for the “shape of collective grief”—is clear but remains mostly internal and philosophical. The ghost’s guidance gently nudges him toward carving the migration path instead of a name, which is a genuine but understated turn. There’s little external resistance or competing demand, so pressure never tightens into a real dilemma or visible sacrifice. As a result, the piece reads more as extended revelation than conflict under mounting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—Elias’s need for moral and metaphysical balance—is clear, but the pressure remains low and largely internal. The pause in the pendulum’s swing offers a notional time constraint, yet there’s little sense of risk, opposition, or potential failure in this particular attempt. The escalation is more in the explanation of his method than in a tightening of consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the deterioration of echo-systems and helping individual echoes like Captain Foster resolve—is declared early and followed. There is one meaningful deepening when Elias isolates the “stormy blue” thread and uncovers the true nature of Foster’s attachment (forgiveness, not fulfillment), which reweights the situation. However, the work proceeds without resistance: no misstep, time pressure, or real risk complicates the untangling, and nothing important is sacrificed. As a result, tension remains mild and the stakes feel largely intellectual rather than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he will “write” a constrained but fertile future—is stated but never sharply tested. There is a nominal tension around the blank page and the weight of his quill, yet no opposing force, deadline, or real risk of failure, so escalation is mostly an intensification of imagery rather than pressure. His decision to proceed with writing doesn’t foreclose a clearly dramatized alternative path or exact a tangible price. As a result, tension remains low and largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—reviving stories in a famished world—is clear and appropriately large. There is one meaningful tightening when the lyrics shift from enigmatic to instructive and Elias chooses to follow them into the alcove. However, once the crystal appears, the path to success is almost frictionless: no real risk of failure, opposition, or trade-off is dramatized as he sings and awakens the dust. As a result, escalation reads more as a graceful unveiling than as genuine pressure that forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can successfully fix a fleeting emotion into something durable—is clear early and aligns with his profession and grief. Pressure does increase as he unwraps the mask, begins powdering, and the gallery “holds its breath,” with the transformation of the mask functioning as the key tightening. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that he might fail or that alternatives exist, so the escalation is more in mood than in consequence. The quiet turn works, but it doesn’t quite bite hard enough for a higher conflict score at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving counter-history against an authoritarian mythos—is articulated early and tracked throughout, with the cog and charts raising the potential impact. Escalation exists in discovery of the cog, then the pre-dynasty charts, then the sudden physical peril of tremors and flood. Yet antagonistic pressure from the regime is entirely off-stage, so the political stakes never bite in scene, and the flood feels like a generic disaster rather than a thematically sharpened test. Sebastian’s final choice to carry his findings upward comes without a serious on-page trade-off or visible loss, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—preserving a vanishing art and using it to mend old hatreds—are clearly declared, but on the page the opposition is mostly conceptual or offstage (the skeptical administration). The main on-page “conflict” is gentle: students’ hesitation and self-consciousness, which dissolve relatively easily under Eleanor’s guidance. There is one modest tightening when two students from opposing sides of town discover their perfect fifths, but no real reversal or painful trade-off. As a result, pressure feels low and the costs of her mission remain mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can grow and direct a new locus of knowledge and memory as an act of resistance—is clear but stays mostly internal and conceptual. Pressure does increase somewhat as the plant mirrors her negative emotions, and the pruning moment is a modest tightening where she must discipline her inner state. Still, there’s little sense of genuine risk (personal, moral, or practical) that might derail her project or corrupt the fruit. The climax rests on a single quiet decision (sharing vs. consuming), which works thematically but lacks visceral escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder and memory can be preserved in a numbed, failing city—is clear, but conflict is gentle and largely internal. There is one true tightening: Elias discovers the log is a poem, which reweights his mission and leads to the decision to place it in the box and then give the box away. His honesty “curse” and the blackout set up potential friction, yet they rarely corner him into hard trade-offs; climbing the tower and accessing the panel are almost frictionless. The cost of losing his one private comfort is present but underplayed, so tension feels more elegiac than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to test/sanctify a living house—remains mostly conceptual and low-risk, limiting tension. There is a clear escalation from passive observation to handling a dangerous-feeling shard to actively rearranging the house’s innards, but nothing seriously opposes or complicates him. The house’s intensified breathing hints at potential danger or awe, yet no real dilemma or sacrifice emerges; his “knew what must be done” is not contested on the page. As a result, the story is engagingly eerie but not truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will remain a silent guardian or engage with the world above—is signaled and coherently developed. Pressure escalates via the ampoule’s arrival and the conceptual flood he experiences, culminating in his choice to send a response on his own terms. However, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with minimal sense of immediate risk to the garden or to him if he missteps, which softens the felt cost. One sharper articulation of what he fears losing would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—escape from eternal confinement by intellectually understanding and "solving" the punishment—is clear from early on. Pressure nominally escalates as the staircase shudders, air vibrates, and time’s urgency presses, but Elias rarely feels in danger of failure; there’s no substantial reversal or genuine risk of making things worse. His agency is central (choosing to risk everything on the proofs), yet the success reads somewhat predetermined. The cost of that daring is largely backfilled (years of mapping) instead of being sharpened into a concrete on-page tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether her kindness is remembered—exists and is signaled early, and the “experiment” with the old man provides a clear focal pressure. Escalation is gentle: tension builds from insomnia and doubt toward the daydream verification and the act of inscribing the memory-language. However, the conflict remains largely internal and low-friction; there is little sense of genuine risk or trade-off beyond emotional validation. The resolution feels somewhat easy—she succeeds on her first on-page attempt—limiting the felt cost and narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving identity and art under displacement—is clear early and threads through the loss of the fresco, the baking ritual, and Elara’s explanation to the child. Escalation is mostly internal and textural rather than dramatic; pressure deepens as the fresco’s disappearance moves from report to literal consumption as a burnt “L.” That said, the piece remains somewhat static in external terms: no live alternative or hard choice is explicitly foreclosed beyond a quiet acceptance of mourning as their only available tactic. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than plot-driven, which works but keeps the intensity in a mid-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—transcending ordinary time at the cost of self—is clear and escalates from curiosity to dangerous experiment to irreversible dissolution. His agency drives the turns: choosing to come at low tide, deciphering the yoyo’s “trick,” then letting go of the cord. The conflict is more existential than adversarial, but pressure does tighten as reality frays and the yoyo vibrates violently, making the moment of release feel like a genuine point of no return. Stakes are mostly conceptual/cosmic, so the visceral tension could be stronger, but what’s there is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to confront the most terrifying version of death and what that means for the narrator’s post-resuscitation existence—is clear. Pressure tightens effectively as they approach the “still dead” mirror and the advisor’s voice fades, forcing a decisive act (embracing the dying self). The cost, however, is largely conceptualized as a reframing of fear into art, without much concrete loss or sacrifice on the page. Tension is mainly internal and abstract, but it does escalate once in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict and stakes remain mostly abstract—survival, loneliness, “obstacles”—without a concrete on-page challenge that escalates or forces a trade-off. The clouds hint at potential threat (“whether storms or stillescence”), yet the chosen blue-hour vignette unfolds without any genuine risk to the orchard or prophet. The storm backstory and visitors’ tragedies are rich potential pressure, but they’re recounted instead of enacted. As a result, the prophet’s ongoing choice to transmute obstacles into music is admirable but never put under serious strain within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—piercing the mystery of the watchers/father versus the city’s protective denial—is clear and escalates through her long observation, the shell-crack discovery, and the risky first communication attempt. The crack and revelation of the device form a strong tightening, narrowing her from speculative mapping to an active test of contact. However, opposition is mostly ambient (social dismissal and implied cosmic horror) rather than actively pressing back on her choices, so tension stays intellectual more than visceral. Costs of failure or success (what might happen if she opens contact wrongly) are gestured at but not concretely pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether to expose a destabilizing truth or preserve a “noble lie”—is clearly signaled early and returns at the climax. There is a meaningful tightening when the station master physically intervenes and the letter skids away, forcing Elias to argue under immediate threat. However, the master’s reversal comes quite fast and with minimal resistance, making the victory feel somewhat easy and the cost abstract rather than viscerally earned. Conflict is coherent and continuous but could benefit from one more concrete price or harder trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—rescuing memory from oblivion during a narrow access window—is clear, and the warning horn supplies a modest tightening of pressure. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and textural; there’s no genuine risk that he will fail, reconsider, or pay a new price for his commitment. His actions are methodical rather than adaptive under stress, so escalation is more implied (time passing, water returning) than dramatized through changing tactics. As a result, tension is present but not especially gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure is an intellectual mystery rather than a lived threat: what is the library’s true origin, and what does that imply? This does escalate from idle curiosity to “almost feverish determination,” but there is little on-page risk if Elias fails, and no countervailing obligation or fear pushing back against his drive. The blackout and dwindling fuel provide light situational tension but don’t significantly narrow his options or force hard trade-offs. The result is engaging but low-intensity conflict more akin to an elegant puzzle than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can meaningfully preserve or reconstitute Liora through his luminous craft—is clear and emotionally weighty. Pressure escalates modestly via focus: from general description of the practice to the higher-intensity task of capturing her laughter, and finally to the reckoning that this may never truly bring her back. His agency is endurance and continued participation in a process he knows is delusional, which carries a visible emotional cost. Still, the conflict stays mostly internal and tonal; there is limited sense of narrowing options or a distinct turn beyond deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will do with the discovered pools of unused potential—is established, and the move from analysis to “real hunt” provides a meaningful tightening. Internal conflict is gestured at through his “anticipatory horror and ecstasy,” but he encounters no real resistance or competing imperative that would force a visible trade-off. The resulting tension is largely conceptual rather than situational; we feel the creepiness of what he plans more than we watch him tested. This keeps escalation effective but somewhat muted, especially for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core conflict—Kai navigating between mission parameters and the pull of a vast, inclusive “frequency of belonging”—is clear, and the energy field provides a concrete external obstacle. There is one solid tightening beat when the drone stalls at the barrier and Kai must decide whether to push past protocols, but beyond that the pressure plateaus. Stakes are framed on a grand, even cosmic scale, yet on the page there’s little sense of risk, sacrifice, or potential loss (for Kai, the drone, or humanity) if things go wrong. As a result, escalation feels more like an increase in wonder than in jeopardy or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias and Mara will finally articulate and repartition the weight of his crime—is clear from early on. Pressure deepens with the explicit articulation of his role in her brother’s suicide and his admission that he keeps manufacturing false histories as a coping mechanism. The main escalation is internal/emotional rather than situational, and it works, but the conversation proceeds a bit smoothly, with limited pushback or risk of rupture once they begin “talking about it.” The end choice carries cost, yet one sharper moment of real jeopardy to the relationship would increase felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are overtly high—lives and the possibility of peace—but on the page, conflict is largely declared rather than dramatized. Both sides arrive as planned, honor the moon synchronicity, and complete the exchange without a significant obstacle, reversal, or hard negotiation moment. Roshni’s brief query about the apology hints at potential tension that never sharpens into a true test of will or ethics. As a result, pressure feels static and the cost of success is mostly historical, not paid in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether she can navigate again in a way that feels morally and emotionally tenable—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure tightens when she drifts off course and finally chooses to unearth the compass, forcing a test of the very faculty she mistrusts. However, the crossing unfolds with relatively low external resistance, and the danger feels mostly symbolic rather than physically or morally acute. The result is a strong but somewhat gentle escalation curve for a piece aiming at top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk himself to confront/bury/unearth his past in order to regain empathy—is clear and escalates from tentative reading to physical descent to full bodily submersion. The second newspaper and its shifting sentence constitute an effective tightening that forces a concrete choice. His final act (releasing the baseball and accepting the cold) forecloses alternatives and carries credible cost. The conflict remains mostly internal, but it’s interwoven with tangible environmental pressure, so tension doesn’t feel purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elara will change herself to reunite with Shadowpaw—is signaled early and escalates once she ignites the spices and begins transforming. The internal conflict between clinging to humanity and embracing metamorphosis is coherent and intertwined with the external act of conjuring. However, resistance feels relatively soft and there’s little sense of what she concretely loses by choosing transformation, so the pressure never tightens into a hard trade-off. The reunion reads more as an inevitable fulfillment than as a costly decision under real strain.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can access where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and followed consistently. Pressure escalates as she chooses to unfasten first her heart’s protections, then the dimensional seals, culminating in direct exposure to the realm of lost time. The cost is internal but real: she discovers she cannot reclaim hours, only learn to live with their transformed, suffocating beauty, foreclosing the fantasy of reversal. The conflict remains largely one-track and inward, so there’s room for one more sharp, on-page test of resolve to heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—opening a potential future for something beyond dying humanity—is clear, and the main conflict is Elara versus the psychic and metaphysical difficulty of shadow work. Pressure does increase during the stitching sequence as she confronts darker parts of herself and grows heavier, though the opposition remains largely conceptual and described rather than felt as concrete jeopardy or narrowing options. The final choice not to step through the portal is meaningful but comes with limited on-page struggle at that instant. The story has one solid tightening but lacks a truly sharp, visceral pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s desire to grasp change—is interesting but remains mostly conceptual, with minimal external or internal opposition. The only real tightening is the dropped bottle and chase of the escaped bug, and even that unfolds without risk, dilemma, or genuine jeopardy. Coincidence, not difficult choice, produces the box discovery, and the volcano’s rumbling never meaningfully threatens him or forces a trade-off. As a result, tension is gentle and static rather than building toward a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the fort versus exposing/embracing a revolution around its power source—is clearly signaled. There is a meaningful tightening when Elena discovers coded messages implicating commanders and must choose whether to open the secret passage. However, opposition is soft: there are no real obstacles, time constraints, or counter-forces on the page, so her movement through the fort feels low-risk. The final alignment with the engineers reads more like a smooth acceptance than a pressured, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—wresting understanding (and eventually control) from a broken physics system—is clear and present early via the herding problem and the inherited promise. Pressure tightens effectively when the pattern activates, the stones flare, and her visions warn of imminent destabilization, forcing her to choose between remaining an observer or risking herself as conductor. Internal and external stakes are well braided, and her agency drives the peak turn. The emotional and material cost of that choice, while conceptually strong, is not as viscerally felt as it could be on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core conflict—remain in imposed silence or risk re-entering the world with forbidden words—is present and legible. Escalation comes mainly from the shift from contemplation to the concrete opening of the envelope, and then the decision to descend with the poem as “map.” However, pressure never fully sharpens into a viscerally felt price; no external force or immediate repercussion counters his choice, so the risk feels largely notional. The result is a beautifully framed but relatively low-intensity conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The intellectual “fencing match” is clearly established as the central conflict, and the sundial/needle mechanics provide a promising engine for pressure. However, escalation is mostly tonal—more ornate metaphors and quicker exchanges—rather than a real narrowing of options or raising of cost. There’s no meaningful reversal or moment where one might truly “lose” something they care about. The transition to harmony comes quickly, so the stakes remain largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving forbidden knowledge and this improvised library—exists and is clear. The introduction of state pressure (“authorities threatened to dismantle…”) is a potential escalation, as is the earlier loss of the prison library. Yet these pressures are mostly handled in quick summary, with the network reveal resolving the threat almost immediately and without on-page sacrifice or difficult trade-off. Conflict feels more like a steady ethos of resistance than a tightening vise, so the stakes never quite bite at a visceral level.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—his desire to alter or “remind” fate via the clock—is clear, but the pressure on that desire never meaningfully tightens. Once in the arbor, each step of the plan works with minimal resistance: the compasses stabilize, the projection aligns, the gears respond. There’s no real on-page cost or hard trade-off presented if the attempt fails or succeeds; the world and his psyche feel largely safe. As a result, escalation is more procedural than tense, softening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the monsoon—appears early and remains clear, and the dream journey offers a conceptual tightening as Elias passes from image to image toward the void. However, the pressure doesn’t quite peak; he encounters symbolic obstacles but overcomes them without a real reversal, sacrifice, or narrowing of options beyond the implied time limit. His doubt surfaces but never seriously threatens his resolve or method, so the felt cost of success is modest. The result is engaging but not yet as tense or testing as the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—whether Kenji can metabolize his regret without Aiko present—is clear and steadily pressured by the rituals that force him to confront specific memories. Escalation is internal but present: from arrival with a goal, through active engagement with the lace method and bonsai technique, to articulating regret aloud and accepting a future not centered on Aiko. The emotional price (accepting that unspoken apologies will likely remain unspoken to her) is implied rather than dramatized in a sharp turn, which keeps the stakes a bit muted. Still, the shift from paralysis to charged acceptance is credible and earned.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no active conflict or opposition on the page; the flood is past, and the magic works perfectly without resistance or risk of failure. The stakes (Mr. Gable's grief) are abstract and handled remotely, removing any immediate pressure or need for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are legible regarding Kaelen's artistic identity, but the antagonist (the syndicate) is introduced too late to exert active pressure on the page. The resolution comes through discovery and convenient interpretation rather than a high-stakes test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure during the experiment. The dominant stake ("tyranny of nothingness") is abstract and is resolved by a montage of "working for hours" rather than a specific, high-stakes crisis. The victory feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are conceptually high but structurally low, as the primary obstacles (the diving expeditions, the research) are summarized rather than experienced. The climax relies on abstract description of a ritual rather than a concrete test of agency, softening the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared ("survival") but remain abstract due to the lack of an immediate, high-pressure test; conflict is diffused over time rather than escalated through a specific confrontation or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, no internal resistance to the memory, and no risk of failure in the healing process. Without a counter-force or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the stakes remain abstract and the narrative lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the garden resists the protagonist's advance. The physical resistance of the maze successfully mirrors the internal struggle, though the obstacle feels slightly generalized until the final confrontation at the tree.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are high and legible, with the "ticking clock" of the collapsing wall creating effective pressure. However, the resolution relies on the convenient availability of the arrow's fletching pattern rather than a purely character-driven tactical shift. The conflict is external and engaging but resolved partly through coincidence (the arrow matching the code).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or internal doubt to create urgency. The "climax" is a procedural completion of a task rather than a tightening of options or a test of the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely philosophical with no tangible opposition; the guards are explicitly negated as a threat by the "dreamlike glow." The conflict is resolved by a convenient realization rather than a high-stakes trade-off or sacrifice. The ending lacks a felt price, as the "cost" is merely the decision not to steal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely abstract and lack felt pressure; the decision to switch from a vase to a teardrop carries no visible risk or cost. The conflict is theoretical ("concept of the thawing heart") rather than a dramatized struggle against consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is deflated by the protagonist's instant competence; he decrypts the puzzle immediately and the antagonist collapses at the first confrontation. There is no escalation of pressure, no back-and-forth struggle, and no visible cost to the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are abstract and cosmic, lacking a personal cost for the protagonist who is &quot;ready&quot; and &quot;paid [the storm] no mind.&quot; There is no active opposition or difficult choice; the narrative follows a linear path of observation without meaningful escalation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the "second chance program" offers negligible resistance, and the violin solves the problem without a significant tactical trade-off or personal cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    The conflict (mistrust vs. transparency) is stated in the narration but not dramatized through struggle; the doodles solve the problem immediately. The climax lacks pressure, as the mistrusting figure uncurls and accepts the registrar instantly, removing the stakes before they can be tested.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is resolved through a magical gift rather than a hard choice or sacrifice; Elias pays no price for his validation. The stakes regarding the Luck Institute are sidestepped by a supernatural event rather than confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or pressure; the machinery functions perfectly on the first try, and the "specimens" act as a passive clock that never forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or opposition; the protagonist faces no obstacles in deciphering or playing the music. The lack of immediate stakes or potential negative consequences flattens the tension, making the outcome feel inevitable from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract; there is little resistance or pressure forcing a difficult choice. The conflict is resolved through a sudden insight granted by the character's special trait rather than through escalating tension or tactical maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist identifies the solution and executes it without facing opposition or making a difficult trade-off. The narrative lacks a moment of "meaningful tightening," allowing Elias to bypass the struggle entirely and achieve a perfect resolution, which deflates the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.5)
    The declared stake ("weight of accumulating histories") is resolved immediately by the refuge without complication or sacrifice. There is no escalation of pressure, and the keeper faces no moment where options narrow or tactics must change.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist meets no meaningful opposition from the patient or the environment. The stakes are declared but never threatened, resulting in a "smooth sailing" arc where the outcome is never in doubt, lacking the necessary tightening of options or rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt on the page; although the text mentions "risks to both herself and the remaining knowledge," these risks never manifest in a concrete obstacle or trade-off. Aria activates a device and succeeds on the first try, leaving the central conflict without tangible pressure or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no on-page conflict; the "enemy" is abstract and distant, the daughter's reaction is a predicted hypothesis, and Elias succeeds without facing a single obstacle. The lack of an antagonist or a constraining pressure means there is no escalation of stakes. The story functions as a retrospective explanation of a victory rather than a scene of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is external and abstract, pitting the priest against a vague entity with no specific tactical interplay. The escalation is somatic (breath catching) rather than narrative; the protagonist succeeds simply by applying more of the same method, with no irreversible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.3)
    The primary stake is clear, but the external pressure ("exhaustion") functions more as a declared ticking clock than a felt, escalating obstacle that forces tactical shifts. The linear progression works for the lyric mode, but the physical cost is only fully realized in the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is present—the doppelganger and twisting rails increase pressure—and the final cost (loss of eternity/power) is legible on the page. However, the stakes are largely declared ("time was running out") rather than dramatized through immediate consequences, and the central conflict feels abstract until the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are deeply felt and personal, centering on the terror of permanent numbness. While the internal pressure is high, the external obstacles are minimal; the conflict resolves somewhat linearly through the application of the "cure" without a significant complicating reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are stated ("humanity's fragility," "integrity") but remain abstract and low-intensity. The potential physical threat (the tail) vanishes early, leaving a purely internal conflict that resolves too easily upon reading a cryptic note. The cost of leaving the sanctuary is theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clearly internal, but the external pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces little resistance beyond his own nerves. The escalation relies entirely on the mechanical blooming of the flower rather than an active struggle or deepening of the dilemma before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.5)
    High stakes are established early—suffering versus betrayal—but the climax deflates this tension by allowing the protagonist to bypass the trade-off entirely via a "third option." The lack of a visible or felt price for this resolution renders the central conflict toothless, as the protagonist achieves a perfect outcome without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low and internal; the "chronic hush" is an atmospheric condition rather than an active opposition. The resolution lacks a visible trade-off or risk; Lyra plays, and the world heals immediately, removing the tension without demanding a tangible price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and low; the dealer’s decision to abandon their professional code meets no resistance and results in immediate "quiet satisfaction." The resolution strips the central choice of any felt sacrifice, trade-off, or lasting consequence, failing to drive the conflict home.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks meaningful resistance or escalation; Marla achieves her goal with Frederick immediately, then stumbles into a second victory without struggle. There is no visible cost to her choices—ignoring a single phone notification is a token gesture that does not constitute a felt price or genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("webs of kinship") and are never tested by genuine opposition; the "despair" is mentioned but resolved immediately by a secondary character's advice. The conflict is solved by a "magic fix" (the arbor blooms because they hummed and sculpted), lacking a visible trade-off or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are established early and escalated effectively; the choice is not just survival but the fundamental nature of existence. The cost of the climax—trading the present world for the future potential of the "echoes"—is a profound and legible price that satisfies the closure requirement well.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story lacks significant tension; the conflict is purely internal and resolves via a successful procedure rather than an escalating struggle. The "tightening" is merely the ritual's progression, and the resolution arrives without the protagonist having to navigate narrowing options or face a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the primary obstacle (discovery) is neutralized by the outage, and the ticking clock is resolved effortlessly. The protagonist faces no hard trade-offs, making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation is handled well; the move from passive observation to the failed intervention (the plastic shield) and finally to surrender creates a solid pressure gradient. The stakes are clearly defined (intellectual mastery vs. chaotic reality). The "shield" beat effectively raises the cost by demonstrating the failure of his control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes remain abstract ("threshing meaning") and are resolved without significant opposition; the stranger offers immediate cooperation rather than conflict. There is no moment where Elara faces a hard trade-off or a risk of failure; the narrative flows unimpeded to its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain low and abstract, as the "missing visions" are an inconvenience quickly remedied by the setting's inherent magic without resistance. There is no antagonist, time pressure, or forcing function to compel a difficult decision; the resolution arrives through "surrender" to a strictly beneficial force.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is low; the protagonist encounters a "challenge" that she solves immediately using her established skills. There is no escalation of pressure, risk of failure, or trade-off required to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes remain abstract concepts ("unspoken truths," "bad habits") that never manifest as concrete, felt risks on the page. The primary conflict is internal but externalized through heavy-handed symbols without a visible cost to the protagonist's resources or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the protagonist’s skepticism offers no resistance to the plot’s progression and is abandoned without cost. There is no escalation of pressure, as the magic object resolves the central tension immediately upon contact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (existence vs. unmaking) are high in concept, and the escalation tracks with the intensifying solar storm. However, because the protagonist fully desires the outcome with minimal hesitation or obstacle, the tension is somewhat muted; the "cost" is exactly what he covets. The pressure comes from the external timing of the storm rather than a difficult trade-off or moral dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.4)
    Tension is diffused rather than escalated; the central threat (the guard) is neutralized instantly by the magic ink without requiring ingenuity or cost in the moment. The "win button" nature of the solution prevents the scene from reaching high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the silent town is a static condition rather than an active pressure. There is no escalation, no narrowing of options, and no moment where the protagonist must trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared ("armor against the nameless void") but remain theoretical, facing no concrete external test or rising pressure on the page. The conflict is entirely internal and abstract, lacking a tightening of the screw that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.9)
    The conflict is abstract and intellectual, lacking visceral stakes or opposition; the "fear" of the conference attendees is told via backstory rather than dramatized pressure. The resolution comes too easily through the agency of the magical objects, bypassing the need for a difficult trade-off or genuine struggle. There is no legible cost to the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("brutal math of survival") but evaporate at the climax. The opposition (developers) presents no actual resistance on the page, capitulating instantly to the spectacle. There is no meaningful tightening or cost; the victory is total and lacks the friction required for a story of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are clear (commercialization, loss of history), but the tension is deflated by the convenient resolution. The protagonist does not face a difficult trade-off or make a hard choice; he simply deploys a pre-existing, unexplained solution (the sand grain) to overcome the obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the repairs are completed with "magnetic calm" and "precise stitches" without resistance. The external stake (the ship leaving) is background noise rather than a forcing function. No meaningful options are narrowed, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is a distinct lack of conflict or pressure. The protagonist faces no obstacles; he waits, looks at a window, and the answer presents itself without testing his agency or demanding a sacrifice. The stakes are purely intellectual and low-risk, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no conflict; the town yields immediately to the tuner's efforts, and no antagonist or obstacle opposes the restoration. The stakes are abstract (restoring balance) and lack a "felt cost" or risk of failure. It reads as a procedural enactment of a ritual rather than a story with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared ("oxygen reserves dwindle") but not dramatized through difficult trade-offs; the phrase "time runs short" acts as a placeholder for actual tension. The resolution is achieved through a magical, abstract process ("unsnarl temporal threads") rather than protagonist agency forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of execution and legacy are established, the tension evaporates at the climax when the obstacle vanishes via magic without resistance. The resolution lacks a "hard" trade-off; Elias escapes by walking through a wall, bypassing the visceral pressure promised by the warden's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is a distinct lack of opposition; the ghost faces no barriers to her goal other than the botanist's initial ignorance, which is easily overcome. The stakes are theoretical ("debt across lifetimes") rather than felt, and the climax resolves without a moment where failure seems possible or cost is incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure that forces a difficult choice. The resolution is an act of creation that meets no resistance, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely abstract; the external action encounters zero resistance (the laborers dig, the object fits perfectly). There is no escalation of stakes; the "cautious enchantment" replaces tension, and the climax is a mechanical act of fitting a key into a lock without a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no stakes or active pressure; the protagonist faces no opposition, time limit, or difficult trade-off. The scene is purely atmospheric, lacking the friction required to drive a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is no concrete antagonist or obstacle; the conflict is Man vs. Abstract Concept ("conspiracies"). The stakes are declared to be galaxy-wide but are resolved with zero resistance or cost, resulting in a flat tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the spirits encourage the protagonist, the shard warms to her, and the moon provides a spotlight on cue. Without opposition or the risk of failure, there is no escalation, rendering the narrative a procedural ritual rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain strictly internal and abstract, lacking an external pressure cooker to force a definition of values. The conflict is resolved by a sudden, author-granted epiphany ("suddenly the notes made sense") rather than a protagonist-driven reconfiguration of options.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is negligible; the setting offers no active resistance, and the protagonist faces no moment of doubt or potential failure. The cost is reduced to a token physical sensation ("energy waned") rather than a sacrifice of something valued. The dominant stake is resolved without meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the environment is welcoming, the guide is helpful, and there are no opposing forces or internal doubts to overcome. The stakes ("certainty vs. curiosity") are abstract and never tested by a situation where Elara must risk one to gain the other.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is distant and low-stakes on the page; the antagonists (Enforcers) never appear, and the threat is reported rather than experienced. The climax involves passive observation of a flower rather than an active, pressure-filled decision by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative lacks active conflict or escalation; the stakes ("pain") are abstract and resolved without cost. The protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or necessary trade-offs to achieve the "armistice."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are legible, with the threat of the library unraveling providing clear pressure. The escalation from the easy fix (chime) to the costly fix (locket) works well structurally, though the cost remains somewhat theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is internal and abstract, lacking an active counterforce; the "risk" is stated ("gamble," "risky") but the ink well offers no resistance, merely trembling before succeeding. The escalation is linear and repetitive (writing one promise, then another) without a deepening of cost or a shift in tactics. The resolution—belief solves everything—bypasses the messy, necessary friction of the "misunderstanding" cited in the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are declared ("town's thirst is a blade") but remain theoretical and abstract. The conflict is intellectual—solving a riddle—rather than a visceral pressure, and the climax lacks a sense of genuine risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is primarily internal and low-stakes on the page; the "skittish bird" provides a brief physical hurdle, but the cost of failure is cushioned by the dreamlike logic of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely intellectual and low-pressure; there is no antagonist, time limit, or concrete obstacle opposing Elea’s understanding. The "hush" pervades the conflict, resulting in a static contemplation where the final decision to stay costs nothing immediate or tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks functional stakes or opposition; Elara encounters no barriers to her investigation and pays no price for her success. The "tension" is purely atmospheric, and the resolution (the machine working perfectly) is never in doubt. Without a moment where failure is possible or a trade-off is required, the narrative flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and conceptual; the protagonist faces no immediate personal risk or difficult trade-off. The escalation is informational only, lacking visceral pressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent as the performance proceeds exactly as planned without opposition, error, or unforeseen consequence. The "chaos" is collaborative rather than antagonistic, meaning the protagonist never faces a moment of genuine risk or a need to adapt tactics under pressure. The lack of a cost or tradeoff flattens the narrative arc completely.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is low because the outcome feels inevitable; there is no on-page antagonist or obstacle resisting Lyra's dance. The stakes (rebellion against the Ban) are high in concept but abstract in execution. The alleged cost ("shedding her former identity") is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through loss or pain in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the rings reveal information that confirms the character's worldview rather than challenging it. The "storm brewing" and "sun rising" act as background texture rather than forcing a difficult decision or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; Elias encounters no external opposition or internal counter-argument that genuinely threatens his goal. The dominant stake (healing) is resolved through a convenient epiphany ("something shifted within Elias's understanding") without a visible price paid on the page. The conflict is theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("equations for hope") and never face a concrete test or opposition. The conflict is internal but resolved via assertion; the lack of a visible failure state removes all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract concepts ("madness" vs. "mercy") rather than immediate risks; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The escalation is smooth and frictionless, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The "burden" is mentioned repeatedly but carries no visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the time limit (bells) is introduced but the protagonist meets it with "perceptively calm assessment," removing all tension. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist must trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the "negotiation with himself" is a stated concept rather than a felt conflict. The stakes—redemption—are abstract, and because the ritual proceeds without interruption or difficulty, the final sense of release feels unearned and devoid of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.5)
    The approaching storm provides a clear, functional ticking clock that pressures the protagonist's actions. While the stakes are legible, the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, lacking a sharp, decisive turn where the protagonist must pay an unforeseen price.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain purely thematic ("lullaby of conformity") and lack visceral danger or consequence on the page. The antagonist is a strawman concept, and the protagonist’s victory feels inevitable, bypassing the need for a defining, painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict remains abstract and intellectual; Elias faces no genuine opposition or personal risk. The antagonist is a "particularly aggressive critic" who functions as a strawman for Elias to lecture, offering no true pressure. The stakes are purely philosophical, and because the narrative summarizes his successes rather than dramatizing a moment of failure or difficult choice, the tension flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, lacking immediate pressure or risk of failure. The arrival of the dying butterfly complicates the ritual slightly (Accumulative lens), but Elias accommodates it without struggle or cost. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options; he simply proceeds as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral, as there is no active opposition or possibility of failure on the page. The escalation is minimal—he unravels the rope, tugs it, and it works immediately—resulting in a low-pressure narrative that lacks the tension required for a literary climax.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is external (storm, failing AI) but the protagonist faces no genuine opposition; his foresight allows him to pre-emptively solve problems, removing the need for difficult trade-offs. The narrative lacks a moment where success is in doubt or a price is visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the "new regime" provides background urgency but no active opposition, and the celestial alignment occurs on schedule. The lack of a live obstacle or a moment where failure is possible drains the narrative of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are negligible because the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; every attempt to heal succeeds immediately and completely. The "resistance" from Maya is overcome in a single sentence, and the magic box removes the possibility of failure or cost. There is no pressure or deepening of the conflict, merely a repetition of the healing cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active resistance from the environment, the tool, or the dream itself. The ritual proceeds smoothly to success without forcing a difficult trade-off or testing Elian's commitment, leaving the stakes largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and retrospective; the present action (planting) faces no active opposition or risk of failure, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no antagonist or concrete obstacle, only a process of inevitable understanding. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or visible costs; the "brightened disquiet" is a stated outcome, not a price paid on the page for the knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual and resolved through summary ("routine of study") rather than immediate, escalating pressure. The antagonist (the mountain) is passive, offering no active resistance to Elara's "renegotiation," which makes the climax feel like a lecture rather than a high-stakes confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is mechanical; threats ("fog fought back") are immediately resolved by the protagonist "roaring" or using the card, with no difficult trade-offs or tactical shifts. The stakes remain abstract ("find the garden") and lack visceral danger or urgent consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract ("clarity") and are never threatened by concrete opposition, time pressure, or the risk of failure. The protagonist encounters no setbacks; the door opens easily, and the rope is fixed instantly via intuition, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical (noise vs. silence) rather than felt; the antagonist (energy beings) is ignored and poses no active threat to the protagonist's agency. There is no escalation or "tightening" of options; the ritual works on the first try without trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or opposition; the obstacle (a broken prism) is immediately overcome by the protagonist's innate knowledge and a conveniently placed magical shard. The stakes, while declared as global (civilization's hope), feel abstract because Kaelen never faces a moment of genuine risk or potential failure. The narrative lacks a tightening of options; the path to success is straight and unobstructed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract; Kael faces no opposition or internal resistance, and the "cost" of his effort is described as "bittersweet" without concrete manifestation. The dawn provides a deadline, but the lack of a difficult choice or trade-off leaves the narrative pressure flat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (hopelessness) faces no concrete opposition; the puzzle solves itself through procedural steps without risk of failure or escalation. The protagonist is never forced to make a difficult trade-off or confront a possibility of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (emotional endurance of a breakup) is clear, but the conflict is muted by Elian's immediate philosophical distancing. The pressure of the "unsaid words" is tangible, yet the protagonist's ability to instantly sermonize about it lowers the felt stakes. The tension remains largely atmospheric rather than interpersonal or deeply internal.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are low; the gravity inversion acts as a timer rather than an antagonist, and the protagonist succeeds without paying a visible on-page cost. The "agony" of the experience is told rather than shown through consequence or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; the antagonist is a distant echo, and the stakes are purely atmospheric ("the air itself were holding its breath"). Elara encounters no resistance, doubt, or trade-off in executing her task, resulting in a zero-stakes narrative where success is guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are declared but on-page pressure is low; the protagonist bypasses the primary external threat instantly via a gadget, removing potential cost. The final decision is framed as a realization rather than a difficult choice between genuinely competing values or temptations.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high—spiritual suffocation versus survival—and the pressure escalates coherently as the threshold fails. The cost of the final action is articulated clearly ("risk being unable to breathe yourself"). However, the antagonist ("encroaching darkness") remains a generic, shapeless force, which limits the specificity of the external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal resistance, or risk of failure during the ritual. The "pressure" is stated abstractly but never dramatized as an opposing force, turning the climax into a mere procedural task.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    Opposition is virtually nonexistent; the "ghost" figure affirms rather than challenges the protagonist's goal. The stakes are abstract ("hidden truth"), and the cost is described metaphorically ("felt the weight") rather than paid in a visible, irreversible way on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment aids the knight ("fruits pulsing brighter") and the task awaits him passively. Stakes are declared on a macro scale ("endless night") but are not felt through immediate danger or the necessity of a difficult trade-off on the page. The resolution comes without a visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is minimal, as the protagonist faces no external resistance or time pressure in his search. The stakes remain low and purely internal, with the "victory" achieved through serendipity rather than a high-cost decision or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are declared high (historical truth), but the lack of immediate on-page consequences for the protagonist softens the pressure. The ending, implying a reset where she returns to her job despite triggering alarms, reduces the felt cost of the rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are high (collective memory), but the on-page resistance is low; the prophecy "manifests" but does not actively fight back or force Elias to adapt his tactics mid-performance. The victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won against an opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    There are no significant stakes or obstacles; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, and the ritual succeeds on the first try. The transition from seed sorter to memory keeper incurs no visible cost—he trades a mundane job for a magical destiny without sacrifice. The conflict is purely theoretical (lost memories vs. present ignorance) rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict remains abstract and internal; the environment offers no significant resistance to the protagonist's goals. The climax relies on witnessing a magical phenomenon rather than making a difficult trade-off, leaving the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.9)
    The conflict is entirely internal and resolved through a ritual that offers little resistance; the elements (gold, fire, coin) submit to Elian’s will without complication. There is no meaningful escalation of pressure; the rain and the empty foundry provide ambiance but do not force difficult choices or trade-offs. The "cost" is symbolic—altering a keepsake—but because the emotional resolution feels predetermined, the stakes lack visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.8)
    There are no functional stakes or opposition; the collector faces no risk of failure, and the spirits offer no resistance to being healed. The "luminous ache" functions as a labeled emotion rather than a genuine price paid for the magic. Without escalation or the possibility of loss, the narrative lacks tension and propulsive force.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain largely internal, centering on Kael's struggle for composure against phantom sensations. The escalation comes from somatic memory, but the resolution—a sudden derivation of an equation—dissolves the pressure intellectually rather than testing the protagonist's resolve against a tangible external or internal opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no antagonist, resistance, or difficult choice; the merchant immediately hands over the key, and the protagonist accepts it. The narrative mistakes movement for escalation; everything falls into place perfectly, resulting in zero tension or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is minimal and lacks escalation; the environment and the ghost offer little meaningful resistance. The protagonist identifies the problem and solves it with a single climb of a ladder, overcoming the "sphere of force" with a minor stumble. The absence of a tangible antagonist or a pressing resource constraint makes the victory feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are abstract (eternity vs. moment) but successfully anchored by the physical lever and the bottle. The frost warnings provide a functional mechanism for escalation and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    External stakes are stated ("administrators saw him as a relic") but never dramatized; the antagonist is absent from the scene, leaving the protagonist to overcome only atmospheric pressure rather than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.9)
    Global stakes are declared ("town hung in the balance"), but the immediate scene lacks tension as the protagonist faces no resistance from the object or environment. The repair proceeds with perfect fluidity, absent any moment of failure, trade-off, or escalating price.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly established as intellectual and spiritual, escalating through the physical intensity of the delve. While external opposition is minimal, the internal pressure to find "where explanations fail" coheres and tightens effectively toward the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared (storm, lost GPS) but immediately negated by the protagonist's serenity and the ease of her quest. There is no opposition; the storm acts as cosmetic background noise rather than a force forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is abstract and internal ("a question that had haunted her"), lacking an external antagonist or concrete obstacle. The stakes rely on a weak strawman—that science has "overlooked" basic nocturnal pollination—which lowers the dramatic weight of the protagonist's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is negligible; the supernatural force cooperates immediately with Elias's first attempt at communication ("FREE"), removing any sense of risk or difficulty. The stakes are declared ("bound him to its brink") but never tested; Elias pays no price for his success, succeeding in a linear, resistance-free sequence of inputs and outputs.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical ("potential slipping like sand"); the obstacle of choosing laws is bypassed by the convenient "balance" decision. There is no escalation of pressure, only a brief hesitation solved by a mental shift without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the stakes are high (the fate of the archive and city), the conflict remains largely internal and theoretical. Elias's immediate acceptance of his fate removes the oscillation or resistance usually required to make a final sacrifice feel earned and pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is nominal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure in the scene. The "consuming force" of the inheritance is told in backstory but does not manifest as a present-tense threat. The resolution comes too easily, offering a "fix-it" conclusion without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the obstacle (atmospheric interference) is immediately noticed and countered with a pre-planned solution (the bell). There is no moment of doubt, no escalation of risk, and no price paid for success, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.3)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or difficult trade-offs in her pursuit of enlightenment. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening of stakes, resulting in a flat trajectory where success is inevitable and costless.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.0)
    Pressure is stated ("unity... was deteriorating") but remains abstract; the external threat never forces Elisha to alter his tactics or make a sacrifice. The climax dissolves the conflict too easily, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or trade-off required for a high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stakes ("borrowed time") are declared but never tested against a concrete obstacle; the protagonist faces no antagonist or difficult choice, merely following a trail of convenient clues. The resolution comes without cost—finding a book that explains everything resolves the tension without requiring sacrifice, endurance, or a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal resistance while weaving the object. The "snapped string" serves as a gentle prompt rather than an escalating complication, leading to a smooth resolution without stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist executes a plan against a passive timeline without active opposition or a "tightening" moment that forces a trade-off. The stakes are high (mortality), but the lack of struggle or error renders the outcome inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal without manifesting in pressured choices or visible trade-offs. The conflict is resolved by the environment acting upon the character rather than the character making a difficult decision that tests his "rebellious" nature.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict is entirely historical; the present moment lacks active opposition, pressure, or escalation. The coachman faces no obstacles in performing his ritual, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the outcome is guaranteed from the start. The stakes are declared ("remnants of a submerged concord") but never threatened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure is minimal; Elias faces a puzzle he is already holding the solution to, resulting in a linear procedural success without setbacks. There is no felt cost or difficult trade-off required to gain the information.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is primarily internal and low-stakes; the protagonist faces no immediate threat or time pressure, only a philosophical realization. The conflict resolves somewhat too easily—the "shimmer" appears, he understands it instantly, and adopts a new worldview without significant struggle or external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension evaporates immediately as the antagonist offers no resistance ("not angry, but curious"), turning the heist into a friendly transaction. The resolution lacks a moment of genuine risk or trade-off; victory is granted rather than seized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (documenting the unofficial) faces no resistance from the environment, self, or society. The "interregnum" setting provides atmospheric flavor but fails to impose a deadline or constraint that would force a hard choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract; the cost of leaving reality is framed as a relief rather than a difficult trade-off, muting the sense of risk. The escalation lacks immediacy, as the protagonist achieves stability in her created world through summary narration rather than on-page adaptation to failure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake is internal peace, but the external pressure is summarized ("calculated risk," "ruthless logic") rather than dramatized in a specific near-fail beat. The final "sacrifice" is a symbolic move on a board, not a tangible cost paid by the character in the moment; the redemption comes too cheaply to feel momentous.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high but abstract in execution; the opposition is inanimate stone, and the "terrible price" remains theoretical until the final paragraph. The tension is internal and explanatory, lacking immediate external pressure or a visceral counterforce that would make the final decision feel risky on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are abstract ("meaning"), and the physical threat (the wave) is resolved by the tool's autonomous magic rather than the protagonist's agency. There is no moment of difficult choice or trade-off; the alchemist simply endures, and the magic saves him.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict is internal and resolves with a clear on-page cost—the destruction of the art. However, the escalation is weak; the character wanders into a solution rather than being pressured into it, making the final choice feel more like a scheduled epiphany than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clearly defined (connection vs. silence), but the conflict remains low-pressure. The resistance is largely atmospheric (the heat, the distance) rather than active; the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without a moment where failure seems possible, limiting the dramatic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal stakes are well-defined, and the ringing phone provides a concrete pressure point that forces a decision. The choice to abandon the external guide for internal instinct represents a meaningful tightening of the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are immediate and intimate; the threat of exposure is visceral, escalating naturally with the stranger’s approach. The climax is a decisive action with a clear trade-off (abandoning the forage for safety), satisfying the requirement for protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure is minimal; there is no antagonist, internal resistance, or risk of failure in uncovering the truth. The protagonist moves from curiosity to certainty without facing a significant trade-off or cost, resulting in a low-stakes narrative despite the emotional subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict or opposition. Elias faces no obstacles; the ivy hides the door but does not block him, and the lock opens immediately. The stakes are purely internal but are resolved by external magic, resulting in a frictionless journey with no visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are theoretically high (fate of a kingdom), but the tension evaporates instantly upon the reveal, as the protagonist abandons her duty without hesitation or felt cost. The conflict is externalized into a climb and then resolved by magic, bypassing the difficult human dilemma of choosing between self and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is minimal; Elara faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure beyond the stated difficulty of the task. The process is described as "methodical," and she executes it flawlessly. The escalation is purely internal and abstract, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain entirely internal and abstract, with no external pressure or difficult trade-off to force the resolution. The ending acceptance feels unearned because the protagonist pays no visible price to achieve it, resulting in low tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.6)
    The stakes remain purely internal and low-pressure; there is no external force compelling Elara to act or change, only her own reflection. The conflict resolves too easily with the discovery of the inscription, lacking a moment of high-pressure agency where she must foreclose a path or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and personal, escalating effectively from psychological stress to physical crystallization. While the resolution is somewhat swift, the "clean crack" of the transformation creates a decisive turning point. The struggle against the "precise logic of runic grammar" provides a distinct internal antagonist that heightens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the "stubborn" ghost offers no resistance to the device, and the stakes—while high in backstory—face no active threat in the scene. The conflict is resolved instantly by the technology, bypassing the opportunity for a meaningful deepening of the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared ("unravel cosmic illusions") but remain abstract and distant; there is no immediate, localized threat to the protagonist. The progression is smooth and unimpeded—the library cooperates, the book opens, and the merger happens without a moment of doubt or desperate improvisation. The "sacrifice" is a transaction the character accepts without visible struggle, flattening the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is entirely internal and intellectual; while the desire to know is sustained, there is no external resistance or risk of failure. The stakes remain abstract, resulting in a low-tension narrative where the "cost" of the realization is purely philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=2.4)
    Dominant stakes are abstract and declared ("revolutionize something deeper") rather than tested in the scene; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical obstruction to generate heat. The interaction is devoid of conflict, as the characters agree on every point immediately, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks genuine opposition; the father accepts the "lesson" immediately, stripping the scene of tension. Elara faces no obstacles, risks, or trade-offs in achieving her goal, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is virtually no active conflict or escalation; the story describes a stable loop where the protagonist faces no risk of failure. Without a specific caller or event to disrupt the routine, the stakes remain theoretical and the narrative lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are internal and abstract; there is little resistance or opposition to the protagonist's goal until the final decision. The cost (locket) is paid, which earns points, but the lack of escalating pressure makes the sacrifice feel more inevitable than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (loneliness) is clear, but external resistance is low; the antagonist (the woman) facilitates the goal with minimal friction. The climax relies on a swift internal realization rather than a pressure-tested choice, though the sacrifice of the moon rock provides necessary cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the environment cooperates, the tool works perfectly, and no antagonist or internal doubt impedes progress. The narrative lacks escalation, moving from one successful step to the next without testing the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain largely abstract; the "cost" of fixing the anomaly is a vague sense of loneliness, which lowers the tension of the climax. The conflict is internal but lacks visceral pressure or concrete external consequences for the decision to keep the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is virtually no conflict; the characters face no external opposition or internal doubt that forces a difficult choice. The "stakes" (being forgotten) are stated abstractly but never manifest as a pressure that threatens their goal in the scene. Escalation is merely rhetorical (Lyra signs faster) rather than substantive.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is a lack of genuine opposition; the protagonist moves from clue to solution in a straight line of unhindered success. Stakes are declared but never tested, as "intuition" resolves potential conflicts before they can force a difficult trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("running out of time") but never tested by concrete obstacles. The protagonist faces no true dilemma or active antagonist, making the "rebellion" feel theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful opposition or escalation; the guardian performs his task perfectly, and Anna receives the message instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks active opposition or escalation; the "city's anxiety" is an abstract condition rather than an antagonist, and the only specific hurdle (the baker's doubt) is soothed instantly, leaving the protagonist's plan to succeed without testing his resolve or demanding a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the "violence is impossible" constraint removes external friction, and no one opposes her journey. The internal struggle is resolved quickly by a magical object and a sudden realization, lacking a meaningful tightening of options or a felt price for her freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (survival/preservation) is clear, but the pressure is dampened by the ease of the antagonist's satisfaction. The theatrical narration acts as a shield, but the lack of suspicion from the inspector makes the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the ban has already lifted, and the only barrier (the colonnade's song) yields instantly to Kael's will. There is no escalation, no moment where failure seems possible, and no meaningful tightening of options to force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are personal but lack pressure; Lyra offers no resistance, reducing the "barter" to a simple purchase with no risk of failure. There is no moment where Leo's goal is in doubt, nor a difficult choice that tests his resolve or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=2.7)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is no active conflict or escalation on the page; the protagonist has already solved his problem before the text begins, and the narrative merely describes his iterative success. The stakes are declared in exposition but never tested by opposition or risk in a dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the mentor figure provides immediate validation rather than opposition or complication. The stakes are abstract ("society needs guidance") and never manifest as immediate pressure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.5)
    There are no active stakes on the page; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time crunch, or risk of failure during the ritual. The "danger" is informed backstory, not present pressure. The resolution is inevitable from the start, lacking any tightening of options or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation; Elara faces no opposition, time limit, or resource scarcity that forces a difficult trade-off. The transition from diagnosis to cure is seamless, depriving the narrative of tension or a true climax. The stakes, while conceptually high (loss of hope), remain abstract and theoretical because they never threaten Elara personally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central conflict is clear, but the opposition (Eleanor) yields quickly, reducing the pressure of the scene. The stakes feel low-risk because the protagonist faces no real obstacle to her decision other than her own hesitation, which resolves smoothly.

    Stakes remain theoretical and internal; the conflict is resolved by a sudden realization without a visible trade-off or sacrifice, significantly lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the guard faces no active opposition, and the potential failure states (withered/alien plants) are observed rather than struggled against.

    There is virtually no active conflict or pressure on the page; the antagonist arrives and is immediately defeated by a single action Kael was already prepared to take.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.4)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. She simply walks to the center and receives an answer, meaning the declared stakes (the rebellion's future) are never tested by immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is minimal; Maeva moves from point A to B without encountering active opposition or being forced to trade one value for another. The "New Regime" is an abstract concept rather than a concrete antagonist in the scene. The stakes, while stated as high (the future), lack visceral immediacy because failure never feels like a genuine possibility on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract; the conflict is resolved by a sudden, unforced realization rather than a decision made under pressure. The protagonist faces no active opposition, and the resolution lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("sanity," "understanding") and the conflict is resolved without significant external opposition or sacrifice. The protagonist faces no genuine dilemma where a live option must be discarded; the path to resolution is linear and unobstructed once the method is "whispered," lacking the friction required for a high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.0)
    Pressure is negligible; the drone's "alarm" is dismissed without reaction, and the stakes of survival are relegated to abstract backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is static; the protagonist faces no active opposition, difficult trade-offs, or unforeseen complications during the scene. The "cost" is entirely hypothetical and future-tense ("council would hunt her"), leaving the on-page action devoid of stakes. The resolution is immediate and total, lacking the necessary friction for a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no active conflict or escalation in the scene; the stakes (peace vs. violence) are theoretical and exist in the past or future. No on-page event forces a tightening of options or a trade-off; the narrative coasts on established stasis without testing the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is severely undercut by the protagonist's "impervious" nature and the assertion that he "did not panic" because the chaos was merely a "sign." While the stakes are stated to be cosmic ("madness," "weeping stars"), they exert no effective pressure on the page, as the fisher faces no risk of failure and pays no visible price for his victory.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the abstract stakes are high (murder/justice), the on-page pressure is low as the protagonist faces no active resistance or immediate time constraint in the scene. The conflict is resolved through a singular path of discovery that feels frictionless, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are internal (guilt) and external (machine malfunction), but the conflict lacks genuine escalation or a moment of difficult trade-off. The resolution comes too easily when the amber aligns perfectly with the firmware; there is no felt cost or risk to Orion in the final act, merely relief.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition or cost, merely the task of assembling an art piece. The resolution arrives via immediate success once the magic object is applied, lacking a "meaningful tightening" or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract; there is no concrete opposition or possibility of failure on the page. The conflict—hearing screams from the past—is resolved instantly by the act of placing the tile, lacking any escalation or genuine trade-off. The "arms of steel" motivation suggests hardness, but the story offers no resistance against which she must steel herself.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is flat; the protagonist encounters no resistance or failure state. He finds the object, understands it immediately, uses it successfully, and resolves the threat in a single linear sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces a situation and applies a fix that functions without a hitch. There is no distinct tightening of the screw—no moment where the static overwhelms the method or forces a hard trade-off. The cost ("exhausting," "aching") is stated in summary rather than dramatized through a loss of capacity or a forced sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks active opposition; the environment yields its secrets immediately upon Elara's first attempt, removing tension. The dominant stake (purpose) is never truly threatened, as the solution (magic) appears without escalation or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.8)
    Tension is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, internal doubt, or necessary trade-offs, merely a task she completes without error. The "urgency" of the hourglass is stated but lacks consequence, and the climax resolves without the protagonist having to sacrifice anything or change her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared ("cost him everything," "failed to protect") but remain abstract, with no on-page antagonist or time pressure forcing a difficult trade-off. The resolution is achieved through a unilateral, low-risk action (stamping snow) that does not convincingly match the scale of the problem (saving a life/defying the service).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist waits for an external signal and complies without struggle or doubt. There is no moment where the outcome is in jeopardy or where he must make a difficult trade-off; the cost (giving the needle) is treated as a relief rather than a price.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.7)
    Escalation is minimal; the anomaly's perceived hostility is quickly dismissed as "desperation," removing the need for a difficult decision, sacrifice, or genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is entirely internal and theoretical, with no escalation of stakes or external obstacles to force a difficult choice. The transition from isolation to independence is smooth and costless, lacking the friction required to make the resolution resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and low-pressure; the "frayed thread" is an abstract unease rather than a concrete obstacle. There is no escalation or meaningful opposition, resulting in a narrative that drifts to its conclusion rather than tightening through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("humanity's divisions") but remain abstract and external to the scene; the antagonist ("cosmic tricksters") offers no active resistance. The scene lacks escalation; the protagonist succeeds on the first attempt without paying a price or facing a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are global and abstract ("spatial mutiny") rather than personal and immediate; the protagonist's claustrophobia is a declared trait that never effectively blocks her progress or forces a hard choice. The conflict resolves through a magical procedure rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is virtually no escalation or external pressure; the cold is mentioned but doesn't force a trade-off, and the task proceeds without failure or doubt. The stakes remain abstract ("resurrecting the dead") and face no concrete on-page test, resulting in a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake regarding the containment of the storm and the ancestor's legacy. The pressure escalates coherently through the console's interrogation, leading to a decisive moment of agency where Elias chooses to accept the burden of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely intellectual; Elara risks nothing and faces no active opposition. The conflict is internal and mild ("rational mind wrestling"), and the resolution comes through realization rather than a high-pressure decision or sacrifice. The protagonist gains a purpose but pays no cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely intellectualized and reported rather than felt; the startup's ethical slide and subsequent collapse happen in summary, distancing the reader from the stakes. The climax—gathering a jacket and leaving—is a Renunciation, but because the antagonistic pressure was summarized, the release of tension is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is introduced and dismissed within a few lines; the Professor's objection ("I didn't want you involved") collapses immediately upon a single soft spoken sentence. There is no escalation, no trade-off, and no felt cost to the agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract ("finding himself," "truth") and lack external pressure or meaningful opposition. The resolution comes from a decision to "unbend" that feels effortless and instantaneous, devoid of the necessary friction or sacrifice to make the transformation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are high in concept (broken reality) but low in dramatic execution; the protagonist encounters no active resistance and resolves the cosmic conflict with a single gesture. The tension is asserted through adjectives rather than generated by the threat of failure or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the ritual proceeds without error, and the "stranger" consents immediately ("I need this"), removing potential conflict. The resolution feels unearned because the opposition is nonexistent, resulting in a low-pressure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stakes remain abstract and internal, resolved by a memory rather than a difficult decision or external pressure. There is no meaningful tightening of options; the protagonist simply changes his mind after looking at an object, resulting in a resolution that lacks visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks meaningful escalation or opposition; the protagonist solves the central problem through competence alone without facing a credible risk of failure. There is no felt cost to the success, resulting in a flat trajectory where the stakes never feel truly endangered.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.3)
    Stakes are abstract (&quot;preserve wonder&quot;) and face no concrete opposition, risk, or time pressure on the page. The ritual proceeds without error or obstacle, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory with zero escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no genuine opposition; the committee chairman is a straw man who presents no obstacle, and the community's doubt vanishes instantly upon contact with the artifact. The stakes of isolation are resolved by magic rather than sacrifice or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; there is no external opposition or time pressure to force the protagonist's hand. The "bad waters" offer a symbolic backdrop but do not create active resistance or danger. The resolution comes from a simple decision to "let go" without a prior escalation that narrows options or forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; the "warning of dissolution" never manifests as an immediate, on-page threat. The escalation is driven by the mechanical speeding up of the watch rather than the protagonist's agency or rising interpersonal/internal friction. The story lacks a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice one desire for another.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high but abstract; the Empire is a distant concept until the Agent arrives too late to apply real pressure. Clementine's choice feels predetermined rather than forged in a crucible of immediate risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the opposition is passive ("static," "decay") and the protagonist overcomes it with patient competence. There is no escalation, no risk of failure, and no trade-off required to succeed, leaving the declared stakes ("oblivion") intellectually understood but not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("find the source of contentment") and face no external opposition or concrete internal dilemma. The escalation is merely physical altitude, lacking a meaningful tightening of options or a moment of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks meaningful tension or escalation; Elian faces no obstacle in selecting the chimes, and Lyra accepts the "answer" without resistance. The dominant stake is resolved through a transactional success that feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, no time pressure, and no risk of failure to test the protagonist's commitment. The central obstacle—understanding a lesson—is resolved through a passive trance state without a moment of doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are intellectual and retrospective; while the goal (navigation) is clear, the immediate pressure on the page is minimal. The conflict is entirely internal and resolved through a shift in perception rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice. The cost—centuries of time—is backstory, not a price paid in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("authentic creation") and never tested by active opposition; the automation is a passive straw man. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the climb is smooth, and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is minimal as the protagonist faces no active opposition from the environment, the clock, or an antagonist. The story relies on the successful execution of a plan rather than escalation or the navigation of unforeseen obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    The declared antagonist, "stellar doubt," is stated in exposition but exerts no pressure on the scene; it dissolves instantly upon her realization, leaving the story without genuine stakes or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes remain purely internal, and the obstacle (emotional pain) is overcome with relatively low resistance; the monsters do not fight back, they simply submit to naming. A stronger counter-force or a cost to the naming process itself would have heightened the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the cosmic stakes are high, the on-page pressure is low-intensity and procedural (watching drips). The primary obstacle (the bell's silence) is resolved by the environment's resonance rather than a costly adaptation by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.0)
    There are no active stakes or opposition on the page; the warden faces no risk of failure, external threat, or internal cost for his actions. The "burden" is purely theoretical, and the climax—placing a photo—lacks tension because no alternative path or potential loss is presented.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist encounters no resistance from the environment, the object, or herself. The stakes are theoretical (harmonizing logic/intuition) and resolved through flawless execution rather than a high-stakes trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared abstractly ("watcher's burden") and never face a concrete test; the pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The climax resolves without a visible on-page cost or trade-off, as the safe deployment of the parachute renders the declared danger theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are clearly established and the cost of the victory—trading numbness for a colder isolation—is legible at closure. However, the escalation is driven primarily by dialogue and a single burst of magical exertion rather than a sequence of pressured decisions. The conflict lacks a "micro turn" where tactics shift before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict remains low-stakes and entirely internal. The "storms of his mind" and "anxiety" are stated in exposition but never manifest in behavior or urgent choice, meaning the final relief feels like the resolution of a problem that was never truly active.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the conflict is purely man-against-resistance without tactical variation; the obstacle yields linearly to increased volume. The victory feels inevitable rather than perilous, as the environment offers no active counter-move to his efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract ("violation" of a "lucid" state) and the resolution lacks a tangible price. The protagonist integrates the antagonist (the pendant) and immediately gains a "warm echo" in place of pain; this reads as a perfect solution rather than a conflict resolution involving sacrifice or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are conceptually high (destiny/identity), but the conflict is primarily internal and retrospective, lacking immediate external pressure. The escalation through the "approximations" works structurally, but the lack of an active opposing force lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; there is no active opposition or escalation of pressure, as the device works perfectly the moment the protagonist decides to use it. The "wind faltering" suggests pathetic fallacy rather than genuine narrative tension. The protagonist does not have to make a difficult choice or give anything up to achieve his goal, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "strain" of merging realities is dismissed in a single sentence where Elijah's expression merely falters. The stakes are declared ("tear the grotto apart") but never felt, as the protagonist succeeds on the first attempt with no loss, sacrifice, or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes remain largely theoretical and internal ("discover the texture of connection") without immediate external pressure or consequence for failure. The obstacle—the thread snapping—is overcome almost immediately by a shift in mindset, making the victory feel low-cost. The "collapse" at the end provides a physical result, but the personal price paid for this breakthrough is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are purely existential and lack immediate dramatic pressure; there is no active resistance from the students or the environment to force a hard choice. The lecture format results in low narrative tension, making the story feel more like a vignette than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or active resistance; the protagonist faces no antagonist or dilemma that forces a hard choice. The "trembling" equipment is a superficial intensity marker that does not raise the stakes or endanger the protagonist's goal. Success is inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist enters a "threatening" space but feels immediately safe and "free," dismantling the central antagonism. There is no active opposition—internal or external—forcing her to trade one value for another. The stakes are abstract (understanding) and never threatened by a concrete possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is low throughout; the rise in heart rate to "eighty-one" provides a micro-escalation, but there is no moment where the outcome feels genuinely in doubt or the cost of failure is imminent. The conflict is retrospective (processing the accident) and resolves smoothly without forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pressure is negligible; the ritual works perfectly on the first attempt with no cost, error, or trade-off. The stakes (death of a language) remain abstract background context rather than an immediate force compelling a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension escalates well from the discovery of the arrowhead to the confrontation on the phone. The internal conflict is resolved partly through the Jester's magical dampening of Elias's rage, which slightly undercuts the difficulty of the final choice, but the cost—abandoning the vendetta—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is present—statues awaken and attack—but the tension evaporates immediately when the protagonist plays the "final chord," resolving the physical threat with a symbolic victory. There is no felt cost to the victory; the protagonist faces no difficult trade-off or sacrifice to achieve the total transformation of the city.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure is coherent and peaks effectively during the three-second window of the EMP. The stakes are clear and personal, though the opposition is purely automated/environmental rather than a direct antagonistic force, which slightly lowers the complexity of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the protagonist encounters no obstacles in his search and achieves his transformation immediately upon touching the artifact. The dominant stake (finding salvage) is abandoned for the resolution (singing) without any escalating pressure or trade-off. The narrative lacks a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the library yields to the librarian's presence, and the "oblivious" patrons provide no opposition. The stakes are theoretical ("find the place where stories live") rather than urgent, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure or meaningful trade-off. The narrative lacks a tightening of options; it is a procession rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "runaway dream" offers no resistance, and the protagonist captures it without paying a visible or felt cost. The moment of "tightening" (when the painting isn't enough) is resolved instantly by "listening," lacking narrative pressure or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is abstract, pitting a hum against shimmering walls, which generates low visceral pressure. The protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure or personal cost; the victory is secured solely by his pre-existing competence, and the &quot;war against fear&quot; lacks immediate, felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes evaporate because the opposing force (the light) is benevolent and helpful; the protagonist faces no opposition, difficult trade-off, or sacrifice to achieve her goal. The "cost" of the revelation is nonexistent, as she gains knowledge and purpose without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pressure is negligible; the tea leaves immediately confirm the path is "stable," removing suspense before the ritual begins. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of stakes on the page—only the execution of a pre-validated plan.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks a functional antagonist or obstacle; nature and the magic system cooperate fully with the protagonist's desires. There is no moment of tightening where the outcome is in doubt, and no sacrifice is required to achieve the goal, resulting in a vacuum of dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is present as the knots evolve, but the opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than active. The climax relies on a sudden intellectual realization rather than a difficult trade-off or a visibly paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or meaningful escalation; the protagonist encounters no resistance from the environment, the technology, or the "terrifying" presence. The resolution is achieved without sacrifice or trade-off, leaving the declared stakes felt only as abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Internal stakes are clear, and the pressure builds through the sequence of transmissions. The conflict remains largely intellectual until the final realization, lacking a visceral on-page cost beyond the decision to stop.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is strictly external (the approaching thunder) and results in increased speed rather than hard trade-offs. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition to his goal; success is absolute, immediate, and costless. The stakes remain abstract ("unspoken needs") and are never concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no escalation of pressure or stakes; the elevator ride is a smooth linear ascent where obstacles dissolve instantly upon encountering the goggles. Elara faces no antagonist, no difficult trade-off, and no moment where failure is a genuine possibility. The resolution is a gift rather than an earned victory, lacking the friction required for narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no genuine conflict; the immediate physical crisis (falling) is ignored in favor of a low-stakes thematic quest. The protagonist faces no opposition—nature is a "lullaby" rather than a threat—and the "struggle" to categorize clouds lacks urgency or consequence. Tension is non-existent as the narrative glides to a predetermined, safe conclusion without testing the character.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is driven solely by the external clock of the demolition, which creates low-grade urgency but no genuine dilemma. The protagonist succeeds on the first try without meaningful setbacks or sacrifices; the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no stakes or obstacles on the page; the puzzle offers no resistance, the phrasebook opens to the perfect page, and the environment cooperates instantly. Without opposition or the possibility of failure, there is no tension, rendering the "breakthrough" hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pressure is low; the antagonist (the blinding light and memories) is overcome by simply "not flinching" and continuing the work. There is no escalation of stakes or a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something or alter tactics to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is resolved through summary montage ("orchestrating a collective effort") rather than a dramatized crisis. The transition from survival to stewardship happens without a felt price or a high-stakes decision point on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.5)
    High conceptual stakes (the end of existence) are undercut by a near-total lack of antagonistic pressure or difficult choices. The protagonist faces no resistance—internal or external—making the climax read as a scheduled task rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are immediate and lethal, with the descending frost line creating effective ticking-clock pressure. The tension between the delicate assembly work and the encroaching mechanical sentinels drives the scene well.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is absent; the narrative proceeds from a static problem to an immediate solution without an intervening complication or tightening of options. The declared stakes—legal ruin versus a brother's health—are never tested or pressured, as the "variant polymer" solution dissolves the obstacle instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; customers request a service, accept the price immediately, and the transaction concludes. The second encounter mirrors the first without raising the stakes, creating a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.6)
    External conflict is minimal; the protagonist moves from point A to B without significant opposition or meaningful escalation of tactics. The threat of discovery is mentioned but does not force a change in behavior. The stakes are internal, but the resolution comes too easily through a single touch, lacking a felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; external opposition is relegated to backstory ("directors had questioned"), and the broadcast succeeds instantly. The lack of obstacles or risks results in a narrative with zero pressure and no meaningful tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is a fundamental lack of conflict; the environment, technology, and biology all cooperate perfectly with the protagonist's goals. Success is instantaneous upon activation of the device, with no escalation of stakes or risk of failure. The "quaking reverie" serves as a sensation rather than a true obstacle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no active resistance; the environment (gravity/mist) functions more as a conveyor belt than an antagonist. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or narrowing of options—she simply waits for the right time and executes the plan. The stakes ("world tilting toward dangerous myopia") remain abstract and theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "resistance" of the wood is stated in a single phrase but dissolves instantly upon contact. The protagonist faces no trade-offs, and the "miracle" is achieved with a level of ease that negates narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no external pressure testing the protagonist's resolve. The time constraint ("before the next phase") is an artificial intensifier that forces no actual trade-offs or tactical shifts. The conflict resolves through a convenient epiphany rather than a struggle against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are abstract ("thoughts... to revisit") with weak "why now" urgency beyond the external clock of the fireworks. The escalation follows a mechanical "rule of three" (hum, pause, emotion) without increasing personal cost or difficulty. The fireworks provide contrast but do not force a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks genuine stakes or escalation; the primary conflict is merely the passage of time, with no active opposition or tightening of options. Elara never faces a dilemma where she must trade one value for another, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, environmental hazard, or hard trade-off that threatens her safety or mission. She navigates the "chaos" comfortably, extracts the artifact without resistance, and gains knowledge without sacrifice, resulting in a flat narrative line.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is primarily intellectual, lacking immediate physical danger or active opposition until the ambiguous ending implies a cost. The stakes are high in backstory (17,000 silenced) but low in the scene, as the protagonist proceeds linearly through the survey without facing difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist enters, performs a task perfectly, and succeeds without a single moment of jeopardy or trade-off. The "mission" faces no opposition—internal, external, or environmental—resulting in a flat narrative arc with zero escalation. The stakes ("certifying wonder") remain abstract and theoretical, never grounded in a risk of loss or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are declared ("risk everything") but never actualized in the scene; the environment and the "hostile elements" remain passive backdrops. The resolution clears the protagonist's burden without a visible, paid cost or a forced trade-off, lowering the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.4)
    The conflict is abstract and lacks interpersonal or internal friction; the external pressure of the vanishing stars is resolved by Silas simply pressing the artifact to his chest. There is no moment of doubt or difficult trade-off; the solution is immediate and total.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the primary tension is an internal "nervous energy" that is resolved through a pleasant conversation. The hermit encounter removes the burden of discovery from the protagonist, dissolving potential tension into exposition. There is no meaningful escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or active opposition; the frost yields its secrets immediately, and the prism works without failure or price. Without a possibility of failure or a competing need, there is no tension to escalate. The narrative is a procedural success story that never places the protagonist’s worldview in genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are clear—connection versus the void—and the ritual provides a structured escalation of tension. While the "fingers bleeding" cost is a bit cliché, the conflict coheres under the Accumulative lens, driving toward a distinct shift in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active resistance from the environment, the magic, or society within the scene. The "indifferent rhythm" of the world is an abstract concept rather than a concrete opposing force. Without a moment of potential failure or a difficult trade-off, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.1)
    The stakes are declared ("withheld truth," "scapegoat") but the conflict is bypassed by the protagonist's supernatural power. There is no active opposition or trade-off; the "engineer" is a blur, and the solution requires no sacrifice beyond a momentary sensation of being "unstitched."

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant external opposition or internal hesitation in executing his task. The "ghosts" provide atmosphere but do not complicate the action, resulting in a flat escalation curve lacking genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; Kaelen controls his domain completely, facing no antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure that forces a trade-off. The dominant stake ("humanity's future") remains abstract and distant, never manifesting as a concrete problem he must solve in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and abstract throughout. The conflict is a gentle intellectual inquiry that lacks urgency; "weeks passed" serves as a montage rather than an escalation of pressure. The resolution comes without a trade-off or significant obstacle, making the epiphany feel like a gift rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain intellectual and low-pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or significant cost beyond a "stretched schedule." The climax resolves a curiosity without a felt price, lacking the requisite tension for a literary peak.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal doubt that forces a hard choice. The "failure" of the past is mentioned in backstory but does not create present-tense friction; success is immediate and total.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes (isolation vs. connection) are clear, but the escalation is strictly internal and low-voltage. The conflict resolves somewhat conveniently through a philosophical reframing ("nested paradoxes") rather than a difficult trade-off or heightened external pressure. The cost—hiding the journal—is a nice touch but feels defensive rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are low and primarily atmospheric; the central conflict is a passive chase for a "ghost" scent rather than an active struggle against opposition. The resolution comes through a gentle meeting rather than a pressure-tested choice, and the "cost" (sharing the bread) feels symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stakes (loss of memory) are established, and pressure escalates via the fading light (time limit). However, the conflict remains purely situational; Elara faces no dilemma or active opposition, and she never has to sacrifice one asset to save another, resulting in low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is clear but lacks visceral pressure because the obstacles are summarized rather than experienced. The protagonist retreats after each failure without incurring a visible cost or consequence that alters her subsequent tactics beyond trying a new method. The escalation is mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is low; the protagonist encounters no external opposition and the internal barrier (skepticism) dissolves instantly. The escalation is merely proximity-based (getting closer) rather than stake-based, resulting in a climax that feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are declared but never tested on the page; the protagonist meets no active resistance, and the "conflict" resolves without sacrifice or trade-off. The immediate, frictionless success upon picking up the charcoal deflates all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is devoid of genuine opposition; Marius confesses immediately upon being asked, and the council offers no resistance to the leaf campaign. The resolution feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or difficult trade-offs to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no antagonist, internal obstacle, or friction; the tuner adjusts a lever and the machine works perfectly. The stakes ("preserving wonder") remain abstract assertions, and the total lack of resistance makes the resolution feel unearned and devoid of narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is present as the static grows, but the stakes remain internal and theoretical rather than visceral or relational. The "sacrifice" at the climax (burning the parts that hold it captive) frames the cost as a benefit, undermining the sense of a genuine trade-off or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; Elias faces no opposition, dead ends, or personal risks during his investigation. The clues are handed to him willingly by neighbors in summary, and the resolution is achieved without sacrifice, resulting in a linear "fetch quest" structure devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative introduces opposition (guards, countdown) but neutralizes it immediately through authorial fiat (the mesmerizing dance) rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice. The stakes are declared, but the protagonist is never effectively cornered, resulting in a conflict that deflates the moment it should escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is minimal; the gravity pockets fluctuate but do not force a hard trade-off or genuine risk of failure. The ritual succeeds perfectly on the first attempt ("exhumed seventeen memories"), removing tension. The "tear" is a performative cost rather than a structural price paid for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the prophecy is a passive obstacle that is "unraveled" without resistance. The protagonist faces no difficult choices, risks, or trade-offs, and succeeds with "satisfaction" rather than paying a visible price. The stakes are declared ("sound would be a weapon") but never tested or felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.6)
    The conflict dissolves rather than escalates; the interrogation leads to a confession and immediate acceptance without visible cost or struggle. The narrative relies on the convenient timing of the magic to resolve the tension, rather than a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; the central conflict—facing traumatic memories—is mitigated by the "resonance structures" which act as a safety buffer. There is no moment where Elena must risk failure or endure pain to succeed; the magic works perfectly on the first try, flattening the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.1)
    Tension is low; the protagonist faces no external opposition and the internal conflict is resolved via summary ("Elara felt herself unlink"). There is no escalation of stakes in the scene; she simply executes a plan she had already decided upon. The "calibrated treason" is described but not felt as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pressure is low; the antagonist (the Chancellor) is distant and abstract, offering no active resistance in the moment. Kaelen faces no immediate threat or possibility of failure, and the victory comes without a visible cost or sacrifice, flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active resistance; the antagonist (The Company) is abstract and defenseless against the protagonist's magic. The "exhaustion" cited as a cost is a generic label that does not impact tactics or outcomes, leaving the stakes purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.0)
    The story lacks conflict entirely; the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's whistle, and the fireflies obey without complication. There are no obstacles, antagonists, or difficult choices to test the protagonist’s commitment, rendering the stakes invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.9)
    Escalation is virtually absent; there is no antagonist or active opposition to force a narrowing of options. The investigation proceeds linearly without risk, and the resolution comes without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are legible and the "Third Way" resolution is causally consistent. However, the resolution comes too easily (tuning a dial) without enough immediate resistance or complication, making the victory feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the immediate pressure (the music box winding down) is resolved instantly, and the broader stakes are resolved via a convenient montage of validation. There is no visible cost or difficult trade-off forced upon the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is almost non-existent; the antagonist is an abstract "discordant hum" that is effortlessly dispelled. There is no escalation of stakes or pressure; the engineer encounters no physical or psychological barrier that forces a change in tactics or a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are largely theoretical, summarized as "society... impatient" without on-page manifestation or opposition. The protagonist faces no concrete obstacles or risk of failure, making the eventual "revolution" feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or pressure; the protagonist enters, finds a clue without obstruction, and leaves satisfied. The conflict is purely internal and resolved by fiat, lacking the "tightening" or hard choices required to generate narrative momentum or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are muddled by the disparity between the described mechanism and the character's reaction. Elias reacts to the heart like a bomb ("horror," "cold," "save them all"), yet the device simply stops keeping time. This "stakes inflation" makes the conflict feel artificial, as the consequence of failure (a clock stopping) doesn't match the emotional weight assigned to it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the overseer functions as a passive observer rather than an antagonist, and Zephyr encounters no physical or mental obstacles. The stakes remain abstract ("next phase of existence") and are never threatened by active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes telescope wildly in the final paragraph (from missing ship to global energy revolution) without being tested in the scene. The protagonist faces passive opposition and pays no visible or felt cost for his actions; the resolution is a simple button-press.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared ("boundaries between worlds") but never felt, as the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or difficult trade-offs. The resolution comes too easily through inherent competence ("calm intuition"), bypassing the need for a reversal or sacrifice that would demonstrate genuine courage or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high conceptually (sanity/reality) but the on-page pressure is low; Arthur operates largely as an invisible observer. The escalation is internal and meditative, lacking a moment of sharp external friction or a forced trade-off that would drive the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the sentinel meets no resistance, and the couple's conflict dissolves immediately upon seeing the letter. Stakes are declared ("nearly lost") but never tested through pressure or forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (the parapet, the whispers) cooperates fully with the protagonist's goals, and the "prophet" serves only as backstory. There is no active opposition or dilemma to test the protagonist's resolve, resulting in a low-stakes procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative lacks active opposition or genuine stakes; Elias faces no obstacles in his process, succeeding simply because he acts. The resolution requires no sacrifice, renunciation, or hard trade-off, rendering the concept of "collective healing" unearned and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internal and epistemic (understanding the pattern) but are dramatized effectively through the escalation of the crystal’s response—from a shimmer to a cascade. The pressure coheres, forcing a decisive change in stance, though the conflict remains relatively quiet and low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are primarily internal and aesthetic, which fits the tone but limits the visceral tension. The escalation relies on a momentary lapse of memory caused by the fog, which is quickly resolved by the chalk; a more persistent or costly obstacle would heighten the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the stakes are nominally high (station collapse), the escalation is dampened by the abstract and low-cost nature of the solution. The conflict is resolved by a sudden epiphany and a delicate manual adjustment, lacking a visceral trade-off or a moment where the protagonist is forced to sacrifice something significant to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake (providing peace) is declared but never genuinely threatened; Elijah succeeds with ease, meeting no significant internal or external opposition. The lack of a visible price or trade-off flattens the escalation; the climax resolves via a discovered object rather than a difficult character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clearly declared, and the physical threat of the shadow entity provides immediate pressure. Yet, the confrontation is negligible; the entity speaks once, and Elara immediately defeats it by slamming a console. There is no back-and-forth struggle or escalation where she must adapt her tactics; the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist force is an abstract "imbalance" that offers no active opposition. Eleanor faces no difficult trade-offs; the cost of giving up the tooth is mitigated by her immediate willingness and the assurance that it is "medicine." The potential tension of the "substitute body" is dismissed rather than escalated, leaving the story without a palpable sense of danger or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is no palpable conflict or cost; the task is described as "tedious" but is completed effortlessly in a single scene. The protagonist faces no opposition—internal or external—turning the story into a linear procession of wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the potential threat of an intruder dissolves immediately into mutual affirmation. The stakes of privacy and judgment are raised in the exposition but never genuinely tested or escalated in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of genuine opposition; the "current" and fading figures are overcome instantly in every beat without risk of failure. The protagonist succeeds at every attempt, gathering hopes in a checklist fashion rather than facing escalating stakes or forcing a hard decision. The accumulation leads to an easy victory, missing the requisite tightening of options or deepening of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the gears fit, the moon aligns, and the magic works instantly. The stakes are abstract and never threatened, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low as the central constraint ("world holding its breath") removes external pressures like war or time. The escalation relies on a procedural increase in magical density rather than protagonist agency against resistance, making the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict or escalation; Elian works "methodically" for weeks without opposition or risk of failure. The stakes (loss of imagination) are theoretical and future-oriented, lacking immediate scene-level jeopardy or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elara encounters no resistance from the environment, her own doubts, or external forces. The "unforgiving" method works perfectly on the first try, and the "burdens" are collected only after the tension has resolved, rendering the stakes static.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is extremely low; the external constraint (the kettle) functions as a timer rather than a source of pressure, and the carving process encounters no resistance. There is no moment where the protagonist's goal is threatened or where she must make a difficult trade-off. The stakes remain abstract and internal, resolved through competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is static; the ghost waits passively while Elias thinks, creating no urgent threat or escalating cost. The resolution is achieved through internal acquiescence rather than a high-stakes decision or confrontation, leaving the central tension feeling low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.4)
    There are virtually no stakes or meaningful obstacles; the only resistance is a valve that "groans open." The protagonist faces no risk of failure, and the outcome ("resurrecting hope") is abstract and assured from the start, lacking any felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are internal but low; the protagonist faces no significant resistance from the environment or himself, as the crystal formation immediately harmonizes with him. The conflict resolves through a shift in perspective that feels devoid of cost or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clear but the pressure remains low; the physical task of salvaging the chest meets no significant resistance or setback. The conflict is primarily internal and resolved through immediate realization rather than a pressured trade-off. The protagonist succeeds too easily, which dampens the impact of the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the task (decoding ancient, complex knots) is resolved in three sentences without failure, adaptation, or time pressure. The stakes ("preserve what the world forgot") are theoretical, and no opposing force or meaningful cost tests Elias's commitment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the isolation is described as "splendor" rather than a pressure that forces a trade-off. There is no meaningful tightening of options, and the protagonist enters and leaves the scene with the same stance and resources.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretically high (world destruction), but the absence of resistance or doubt makes the escalation feel flat. Kael faces no antagonist or difficult choice; he simply executes a plan he has already decided on, resulting in a climax without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.1)
    There is no conflict or escalation on the page. The protagonist faces no opposition—internal, external, or environmental—and pays no price for her actions. The stakes are purely thematic ("argument against despair") and are never tested by a concrete threat or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the "migrating geese" timeline functions as a weak artificial clock rather than a source of genuine stakes. There is no escalation of pressure, as success is achieved by simply walking to the next location.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are legible—organic chaos versus mechanical order—and the resolution carries a clear conceptual cost (the loss of "messy" emotion). The pressure remains low-voltage, lacking visceral urgency, but the tradeoff at the end is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is virtually nonexistent; the "thundering calm" explicitly shields the protagonist from the world, and the artistic task is completed without struggle. The "spectral mentorship" acts as a convenience that removes the difficulty of the creative act, resolving the central question without risk of failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are internal and retrospective; there is no active resistance in the scene other than the pendulum's window, which is navigated without complication. The conflict resolves linearly through a ritual action that lacks a moment of doubt, trade-off, or unexpected deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared ("malignant" memories) rather than dramatized through pressure. The antagonist—a stubborn thread—is overcome instantly by Elias’s competence, resulting in a conflict loop that lacks escalation or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; the cartographer faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or external barrier. The stakes are abstract concepts ("the future") that never manifest as immediate threats. The narrative lacks a tightening of options or a moment where failure is a live possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the antagonist is an abstract background condition that offers no active resistance to Elias's actions. Escalation is absent as Elias moves from clue to solution without facing failure, limited resources, or a moment of true risk. The stakes are global but the on-page execution is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the rocking chair provides a clock, but there is no active opposition or difficult trade-off on the page. The protagonist faces no meaningful resistance—internal or external—transforming the story into a processional description of a success.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.2)
    The conflict is primarily abstract (Sebastian vs. Narratives) and lacks immediate, on-page opposition. The stakes are intellectual until the sudden, coincidental tremors force a physical reaction, bypassing earned narrative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared ("vanishing arts," "unlearning hatred") but never tested against resistance; the students unify without friction, and the administrative threat is off-page. There is no moment of escalation where the protagonist risks failure or pays a price for her success. The conflict is purely theoretical, resolved by the mere application of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is no effective opposition; the protagonist faces no antagonist or significant environmental obstacle that genuinely threatens her success. The cultivation process is a smooth ascent where the only potential complication (bitterness) is dismissed immediately, resulting in a narrative devoid of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain low and internal; there is no external antagonist or time pressure forcing the climb, making the ascent feel routine. The final choice to give away the box lacks sufficient setup to register as a painful sacrifice, as the alternative (keeping it) isn't dramatized as a vital necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no authentic opposition or risk; the house acts as a willing participant, and the ritual succeeds instantly. The lack of stakes means pressure never escalates, and the protagonist faces no trade-offs, loss, or difficult decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are primarily internal and existential—the loss of certainty versus the gain of connection. While the emotional shift is clear, the external pressure is low; the conflict resolves through immediate understanding rather than a struggle with the ambiguity of the message. The cost is felt in the loss of his "eternal, silent vigil," fulfilling the requirement for a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is no active opposition; the protagonist struggles against a passive environment and succeeds on the first attempt without setbacks. The stakes are theoretical ("confinement") rather than visceral, and the resolution comes without a visible or felt price paid on the page. The "tension" is stated but not demonstrated through escalating difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is the abstract "city's anonymity," which offers no active resistance to Elara's ritual. The escalation is linear—she intends to connect, she focuses, and she succeeds immediately without setback or difficult trade-off. The stakes remain theoretical ("prove kindness exists") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes—cultural erasure versus survival—are personalized effectively through the bread ritual. The pressure of the "thaw" creates a functional ticking clock that forces the protagonist's stance to crystallize, though the external opposition is relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are established early and escalate clearly through environmental reactions (world fraying, light stuttering). The final choice to "let go" forces a trade-off between existence and ambition, delivering a resolution with undeniable, permanent consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalated through the confrontation with the death-image. The climax offers a legible turning point (embracing vs. fleeing), though the resolution feels slightly mechanical due to the advisor's prompting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=2.0)
    Stakes are theoretical ("survival") rather than immediate; the protagonist faces no active resistance or concrete obstacle in the present moment. The potential sources of conflict—storms, visitors—are relegated to backstory, leaving the on-page action devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.2)
    External pressure is low; the "elders" provide only passive opposition, and the "horrors" are abstract concepts revealed via exposition rather than felt threats. The conflict resolves too easily through the found object, lacking a moment of genuine trade-off, sacrifice, or escalated risk for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stakes are declared but not felt; the conflict is resolved through a "talk-no-jutsu" moment where the antagonist abandons his life's mission because of a single comparison. There is no visible cost paid by the protagonist—he wins the physical and ideological battle effortlessly. The escalation feels artificial, jumping from a lunge to total surrender in seconds.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the rising water is a scheduled, predictable event that Elias navigates with ease rather than urgency. The stakes remain abstract (memory preservation) and are never threatened by a concrete obstacle that demands a hard choice or significant loss.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than opposition. The "blackout" is explicitly framed as a gift that removes distraction, neutralizing potential urgency or external stakes. Without a counter-force or personal cost to the discovery, the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is internal but coherent; the struggle to capture the specific resonance of Liora's laughter creates a tangible task with failure stakes. The escalation leads to a deepening of his stance, accepting the "descent" to fuel the cranes' "ascent."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conceptual stakes are high, escalating from personal grief to a predatory harvest of others' tragedies, which implies a strong moral trade-off. The on-page conflict, however, remains largely internal and retrospective, lacking immediate external pressure until the final decision triggers.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is low-stakes and abstract; the "energy field" barrier serves as a speed bump rather than a genuine test of the protagonist's goals. The decision to "push past conventional programming" lacks a visible or felt cost on the page—Kai risks nothing and immediately gains universal enlightenment. The escalation is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are high (suicide, marriage), but the conflict resolution lacks friction; Mara accepts the confession and the watch hand with minimal resistance, smoothing over the "minefield" too easily. The escalation relies on a dialogue exchange rather than active pressure or forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the opposing commander offers no resistance, resulting in zero escalation or tension. The scene lacks a tightening of options or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake is internal (healing), but the escalation is repetitive (paddling, drifting, regretting) until the magical resolution. The "backlash of regret" is described as a physical force but manifests only as drifting off course, which is easily corrected once the character changes her mind. There is little felt cost to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    While there is a clear goal and a final cost (sacrificing the baseball), the pressure remains low throughout the journey; Elias follows instructions without facing active opposition or difficult trade-offs until the end. The conflict is primarily internal but is resolved through external guidance (the newspaper message) rather than a desperate, self-driven choice in the face of failure. The "labyrinth" promises complexity that the linear plot does not deliver.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high—losing humanity—but the protagonist's immediate acceptance and "steadiness" undercut the tension; the cost is physical but lacks the visceral hesitation or resistance that would generate genuine suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is managed well through the steps of the ritual. The conflict resolves with a distinct cost—the acceptance that beauty and grief are inseparable—though the tension is somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally felt in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are globally high but scenically low because the central obstacle—shadow work—is overcome through summarized persistence rather than dramatized struggle. The cost of the stitching process is described ("body grew heavier") but lacks visceral, on-page consequences that threaten failure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are theoretical; there is no immediate threat or time pressure, and the consequence of failure is merely maintaining the status quo. The story lacks escalation; the obstacle (dropping the bottle) immediately becomes the solution, removing tension before it can build. The "climax" is a moment of convenient observation rather than a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is declared rather than dramatized; the potential tension of a sentinel turning revolutionary dissolves instantly in the final dialogue. There is no felt pressure or cost to the protagonist's investigation, making the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are high in concept ("cosmic deadline") but low in dramatic pressure, as the obstacle is a passive lack of physics rather than an active opposition. The climax resolves through a smooth execution of the ritual rather than a desperate trade-off or escalation of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is declared in backstory (censorship) but absent on the page; the protagonist faces no immediate opposition or dilemma. The climax (opening an envelope) lacks sufficient pressure or cost to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story promises a duel but delivers a cooperative exchange of aphorisms with no genuine opposition or risk. Stakes are declared abstractly ("balance of power in their academy") but never felt on the page; the "intensification" of the argument is summarized, stripping the scene of immediate pressure. There is no visible cost to either character.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the antagonist appears only in summary, and the resolution (revealing encrypted contacts) arrives without setup or struggle. There is no on-page moment where the protagonist is forced to make a difficult trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no opposition; entropy and time yield immediately to the protagonist's plan. The stakes remain abstract because failure is never a live possibility on the page, and the "encore" requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.3)
    The conflict is theoretically high-stakes (cultural erasure) but lacks on-page pressure; the "sickness" is a background condition rather than an active opposition. The climax resolves without a moment of genuine jeopardy or a difficult trade-off, resulting in a flat trajectory where the protagonist faces no significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.6)
    The conflict is almost entirely internal and low-stakes, resolved by following external instructions rather than overcoming resistance. The "tide of remembrance" is stated as a threat but functions more as a background mood than an active pressure forcing a trade-off. The climax relies on symbolic coincidence (the tree being exactly twenty-three years old) rather than earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent emotional chaos via micro-decay—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: dust is finite, each pattern consumes irreplaceable beauty. Agency is attention/renunciation; she chooses to spend dust on neighbor, narrowing future options. Cost visible—knee ache, fingertip smudge—under Accumulative lens; no coincidence. Escalation is cadence intensification toward final wipe, not external reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: transform personal survival into meaningful art without dying from fear or fire. Escalation occurs once but decisively: discovering the smuggler-artist network tightens Kaelen’s quest from vague “purpose” to urgent moral testimony; options narrow to embedding soot or remaining silent. Cost is visible—he risks re-igniting syndicate wrath by immortalizing their crime in public glass. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (frost matching ledger) yet does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each fork strike and heat-map tightens the emotional density until the color-symphony lands. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the void itself. A visible price is paid: Hours of silent labor and the tear-tracked cheek mark the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—give the lost dead a “permanent address”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when conventional repair fails, forcing the dive. One meaningful deepening occurs inside Mirrormere: occupying impossible spaces is the irreversible tactic that forecloses retreat. Price is legible (life-threatening expeditions, molecular tearing), although on-page physical aftermath is skipped. Coincidence never rescues; escalation is causal under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore communal dignity via anonymous care—tightens when youths volunteer after witnessing elders’ renewed gait; escalation is accumulative, not causal, and the cost (risk of caught night runs) stays abstract, limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“release unused love back into the world”—is signaled early and reweighted once when Elias realizes the bridges of light are literal, not metaphor. Escalation is textural: breath-by-breath sharpening of projected images until the luminous webs appear; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forecloses any return to ordinary observation, accepting endless pilgrimage. Would enter 8.8+ band if a tangible loss (stamina, social credit, damaged tool) had been dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sever the past or stay imprisoned—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when each bridge twist re-activates the fragment’s burn. The meaningful escalation is the staircase descent: a single, irreversible narrowing of options that forces the disintegration act. Cost is legible on-page: palm blistering, photographs crumbling to dust. No reversal is needed; accumulative pressure peaks when the tree’s fragments erupt, reweighting the stakes from memory-escape to self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save the seed vault or lose post-collapse food source—signals early and escalates via audible wall countdown. Protagonist agency drives every beat: Kael chooses to repurpose chains as key-levers; the mis-hit note forces recalculation and deeper wrist damage. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the melody must reverse, foreclosing the prior decoding path under causal lens. Price is visible (blood on metal, collapse roar swallowing exterior world) and alters available options right up to the vault reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the exact timbre of trust breaking—tightens through accumulation: each remembered absence (sister’s leaving, orchard’s frozen bloom) raises the cost of failure. Agency is attentional: he chooses to listen one last time, to press the sound into metal, forever trading nostalgia for artifact. The cadence shift occurs when aurora dims and forge flares, signaling the irreversible transfer. Price is on-page: the whistle of his own aid against sudden hush proves the captured sound can never return to him live.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—craft an object that holds both freeze and thaw—signalled at bookmark crease. One meaningful tightening: abandoning the planned vase when icicle image reframes purpose; this narrows options to single teardrop. Cost visible on page: scarred bookmark imprisoned forever—no reversal. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen identity—is signaled early and tightens once: smudged notes force decryption under claustrophobic threat. The single escalation is protagonist-driven (kneel → decrypt → confront), but the cost is mostly emotional assertion; no concrete loss (tool, blood, social credit) is felt on-page, keeping pressure below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the map will become witness or portal—tightens once, at the moment the last star gutters; this single meaningful deepening is sufficient for the length. Pressure accrues through accumulative beats of extinction tallied in gold leaf, each star-loss incrementally tilting the project from record to invitation. Agency stays internal (choice to “welcome”) and the price is conceptual rather than visceral, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. A hair more escalation could have been wrung from the commander’s earlier skepticism, but the piece keeps its focus on stance crystallization rather than external confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape the eternal twilight loop—signaled in paragraph 2; escalation delivered via violin-induced timeline merger that forecloses janitor role. Agency stays robotic yet pivotal: decision to play narrows options, triggers convergence, incurs system strain visible in vibrating frame. Cost is on-page: ice loss, twilight break, 734’s identity upgrade. No coincidence; music as causal trigger taught via Thorne flash. One tightening suffices for this length; pressure coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove gardens recognize their gardener—stays coherent throughout. Escalation is textural: each marble laid down = one brick in a reciprocal architecture we don’t see until the vines assemble it. No external antagonist beyond societal devaluation; the tightening is the slow reveal that his private archive has been publicly mirrored by the garden itself. Cost is conceptual but legible: the balance of power shifts—garden becomes subject, not object—yet Elias accepts continuation of caretaking, now knowingly witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—empirical proof of sideways time—arrives late but then drives every lever pull, so pressure is coherent if front-loaded. Escalation is incremental but unmistakable: each holographic tier narrows the possibility that Elias is wrong, until the third lever collapses superposition into truth. The cost is epistemic, not corporeal—the station’s paradigm, not Elias’s body, pays—yet it is dramatized on-page via the nexus’s near-burning heat. A visceral price (burnt skin, lost funding) would have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore Isabella’s lost music—signals early and tightens as decoding proceeds. Yet escalation relies on atmospheric intensifiers (lanterns flicker “more erratically”) rather than a visible choice that forecloses an option; the musician never risks safety, reputation, or time to raise stakes. Cost is conceptual (custodianship) but not dramatized on-page as sacrifice or irreversible loss, keeping pressure below the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—naming the swallowed truth—threads from first line to last. One meaningful tightening: the second smudge uncovers the brother-shaped absence, foreclosing the option to keep believing the avalanche story. Cost is visible—the Edelweiss is forever marred, and she accepts permanent twilight. Agency is internal yet decisive; no coincidence required. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern break (pristine → smudged) reweights stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the precise weight of swallowed truth”—tightens once: the valve turn converts abstract pressure into literal release, foreclosing retreat. No reversals needed at this length; the single deepening satisfies Accumulative escalation. Cost is the warm draft of ozone-regret itself, legible on the page. Stakes remain internal, but the factory metaphor lets them scale to cosmic without telescopic cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—witness change without judgment—remains abstract; no external or internal obstacle ever threatens it, so pressure stays flat. Silence, river, and obsidian accumulate texture but do not tighten options or impose a visible price. The only micro-turn is noticing new reflective properties, a perception rather than a choice with cost. Because no escalation forecloses a path, the conflict plateau is below the 6.0 threshold for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Maya elicit any voluntary sound from Leo before sunlight returns. Escalation is accumulative-textural: each musical texture (harp, hum, stone rhythm) thickens possibility until the eclipse darkening supplies irreversible pressure. Agency is Maya’s renunciation of forcing; her tactical retreat into stargazing lullaby is the decisive narrowing that invites Leo’s first move. Cost is visible—she risks professional failure in real time under a cosmic clock—yet the reversal feels gentle rather than sharp, capping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from recovery to cosmic reconnection; the diary probe is the single decisive tightening that reveals the metaphysical axis fracture. Cost is conceptual—humanity’s dream-death—rather than personal, keeping pressure legible but less visceral. Agency is pure intellection; the absence of an external antagonist or time-clock keeps escalation just shy of 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the covert network—surfaces early and tightens when the rewritten microdot must reach enemy hands before dawn. Escalation is linear rather than recursive: each beat confirms the plan is proceeding; no live option is foreclosed on-page. The absence of an antagonist’s counter-move or a mid-scene reversal keeps pressure static after the initial jeopardy is declared. Cost is conceptual (perpetual ghosthood) but not dramatized as an immediate tactical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—prevent full possession—tightens through each loop-layer and pigment stroke; the entity’s recoil is the visible price that forecloses the option to give up. Escalation is accumulative: density of loops, light, and violet circles increases until the final unlooped note ruptures the stillness. Agency stays with the priest; coincidence is absent. The cost is felt in his exhausted exit, though the entity’s defeat is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—extract lost childhood melodies before body fails—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each floor climbed. One meaningful turn: at apex he must surrender remaining stamina to release the chord, foreclosing any further search. Cost is dramatized—legs give, glow dims, horizon reverts to plain lake. No coincidence; pressure is internal clock plus cold architecture, both coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape the self-replicating labyrinth—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each retracing until the only exit is mortality. Escalation is accumulative: each loop darkens the viaduct and multiplies ghost-Kaels, raising the cost of continued eternity. The decisive narrowing occurs when he “retraced his steps again, this time with purpose,” trading immortality for a single uncertain step. The price (glow gone, tablet shattered) is legible, but the beat could sharpen the bodily shock of becoming merely human.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—break emotional numbness—tightens through tactile escalation: each grittier vibration demands greater physical complicity until palm-on-disc risks ruin. Agency is sensory, not verbal: filing the needle, boot-soles as antennae, palm-press that forecloses sterility. Cost is viscous and audible—the grooved destruction Elara feels under her skin. One meaningful intensification suffices; the final ache is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust the rogue message—tightens once, at the wax break; options narrow from “ignore” to “act,” with implicit bodily risk. Escalation is textural: dread accumulates through storm metaphors and distant sirens rather than external blocks. Protagonist agency is legible in the decision to step back into the courtyard; cost is the surrender of safe solitude. No coincidence resolves; tension coils rather than snaps, fitting the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understand why a smell can break him—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each failed aromatic defense. The UV reveal is the single decisive tightening: it transforms the goal from “capture the bloom” to “trap the ghost,” foreclosing nostalgia and crystallizing cost. Pressure is textural, not causal-antagonistic, but still narrows options to one irreversible vial. No off-stage rescue; the risk is internal and the price (permanent possession of the grief-image) is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—transform the chronic hush from void to canvas—is signaled early and deepens through each musical iteration. Escalation is textural: each note thickens the silence until the sapling’s unfurling reweights the stake. Cost is legible: bleeding fingers, tear, and the final bow-lowering show price paid. A sharper tactical loss—e.g., a melody permanently abandoned—would have pushed this into 8.8+ terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—maintaining professional detachment—tightens when the petal imports un-bottle-able resilience. Escalation is textural: each sensory intensification (amber thickens, static crackles) raises the cost of proceeding. One meaningful deepening occurs at the midpoint pause where subsume-or-amplify is decided. Price is on-page: dealer forfeits monetizable grief and accepts identity blur; future transactions will carry uncontrolled seed-truth.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and tightens once: the Maestro’s handshake transfers acknowledgment from Marla to Frederick, foreclosing her chance to claim it. Internal want (exuberance) clashes with professional need (caution) but the contradiction stays summary; no new complication tests her commitment. The elderly composer introduces a second micro-turn, deepening the pattern rather than escalating personal risk. Cost is present but mild—one ignored phone ping—so the tightening is meaningful yet not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling community—signals early via frayed kinship webs. Escalation is textural: each sculpture and fragment of tag deepens the stake until the dedication act forecloses passive searching. Cost is visible when Kael’s luminescence flickers and his palms burn; the community’s new dialect of color and light is the undeniable price paid. No coincidence resolves; the tightening occurs through their joint creative agency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—release the echoes before the nap ends—is signalled in paragraph one and tightens with every chime-falter. Escalation is causal: each borrowed chunk of time forecloses a future moment, culminating in the irreversible week-long withdrawal that snaps the cadence. Visible price is implied but not viscerally tasted—no nose-bleed, no vertigo—so the tightening feels intellectual rather than carnal. Still, the final choice is active and irreversible: uncage the source, accept personal erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—convert ambiguous loss into soluble equation—tightens when each nightly iteration fails until the final reframe. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive: droplet, pulse, pattern shift. Single meaningful deepening at climax: realization that ambiguity is habitat, not puzzle, forecloses the path of endless experiment with visible cost (tears evaporating). Agency remains interior yet decisive under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmit hidden history before power returns—tightens once: cache planted → discovery imminent. Escalation is textural: each hidden compartment adds weight to the library’s secret archive; the tape fragment is the pattern-break that crystallizes the librarian’s stance. Cost is present but oblique: Elias risks exposure, yet we feel her gain more than his loss, keeping the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will he force or yield to the leaf’s language—tightens once yet decisively: shield attempt fails → surrender. Agency remains causal: his own actions (logging, shielding, dropping tablet) escalate cost under storm pressure. No coincidence; wind and rain complicate but do not resolve. Price is on-page: tablet forsaken, body battered, epistemic pride drowned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from sleepless experience—remains coherent; tightening happens when brooch exchange makes insomnia a communal conduit rather than private torment, narrowing future options (she must keep painting). No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; insomnia reframed as duty is felt, but no tangible loss (time, health, relation) is dramatized, capping it just under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single dominant stake—“how to regain clairvoyance”—is signaled early and tightens when the pearl offers tangible anchor. Escalation is textural: each harmonic layer and shadow doorway increases density until surrender is the only stance left. Agency is present—Elara chooses to reach, to listen, to speak from shadows. Price is conceptual (open futures, loss of certainty) rather than visceral, capping entry into top band but still legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can the community face its own holes—tightens as each fragment risks reopening wounds. Escalation is textural: each object adds density to the shared absence rather than solving it. The staggered-interval tactic is the visible tactic that forecloses a single cathartic reveal, trading completeness for survivability. No reversal is needed; the deepening of fragility is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access to unspoken truths—tightens when arrows stop at the sealed gate, converting the punch from tool to price. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each step he chooses narrows retreat until the gate demands the punch’s sacrifice. Cost is visible—loss of the punch and confrontation with shattered selves—but the mirrors break without physical harm, slightly softening visceral price. Still, the final renunciation forecloses return, satisfying the lens under Causal track.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—village grief vs. her skepticism—is signaled early. One tightening: the memory cascade forces her to keep transcribing though it invades her identity; cost is the irreversible loss of protective doubt. Escalation is accumulative: each layered memory increases density until the tile dims at dawn. Agency is sustained—she could stop tracing, but doesn’t.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each magnetic pulse. The final fold annihilates the only witness, paying the price in erased existence. One meaningful deepening suffices: geometry frays, options narrow to unmake or retreat; he chooses unmaking.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—Elena's freedom—tightens once: the guard's 90-second window narrows options to now or never. Maya's internal collateral (dad's ledger) braids but doesn't compete; external pressure drives. No reversals needed at this length; one meaningful tightening suffices and is met. Felt price is present: relinquishing the pot and accepting a new imbalance scaled to flash length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve erased time textures—signals in paragraph two and tightens once: today’s “particularly resonant hum” promises a best-yet harvest, narrowing options to succeed or lose the moment. The escalation is density-driven rather than antagonistic, fitting Accumulative lens; cost is felt in spent dawn breath and the lifetime sentence of guarding silence. No reversal occurs, but single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reassemble a life from scraps—is clear early. Escalation is accretive: each overheard fragment tightens the label’s metaphorical cargo, deepening rather than reversing. The final image crystallizes stance rather than foreclosing a live option, so the tightening is poetic, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (he is forever composite), but no tangible loss is dramatized, capping entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“decode why consciousness exists”—signaled in paragraph 1. Tightening occurs when compass flips inward, forcing Elias to trade external proof for internal redefinition; this is the single meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: he forfeits the compass’s next guidance, accepting indefinite wait. No coincidence resolves; the sea-reset rule persists, entailing future risk.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve carnival soul vs. survival math—tightens when graffiti converts decay into “armor.” One meaningful deepening: developers’ curiosity replaces contempt, foreclosing total loss. Agency is cumulative: Mara’s encoded paintings shift community stance; no single reversal, but escalation accrues under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—original acts rewritten, historic artifacts hidden—yet the price to Mara personally (time, risk, identity exposure) is only implied, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“last lunar morning photograph before orbital shift & commercial lockout”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is steady: delay risk → chemical gamble → radiation closure. The tightening beat is the belated warning that makes retreat impossible; summit access is permanently foreclosed, price paid on-page. Agency is endurance & invention rather than reversal, fitting situational lens; cost is omission (future access) rather than bodily loss, slightly softening intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—restore the drone’s navigational feedback before the ship sails—tightens exactly once, via the fountain-refraction reveal of a missed backup flaw; that micro-turn forces a final circuit patch under audible horn countdown. Agency stays tactile: if Elias misreads the shimmer, the drone will crash into the mist he cannot see. Cost is visible in the final image: perpetual asymmetry—he gifts sight to a machine he must pilot blind. The escalation is single but sufficient for 725 words; no reversal inflation, no coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—find the rivers’ hidden origin—is signaled early and tightens when droplets foreclose passive observation: he must trek inland or lose the coordinates. Agency is continuous: cross-referencing, sketching, packing. Cost is legible: he abandons the sheltering outpost for exposed wilderness. Escalation is single but sufficient under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—town revival—tightens through sonic density; each new resonance forecloses the option of remaining ghosted. Cost is legible: cracked windowpane, smoking chimney, the tuner’s solitary departure. Agency is accumulative rather than decisive, fitting the lens; still, escalation feels inevitable rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find mentor truth / wield temple power—is signaled early; pressure tightens when oxygen drops and timeline distortion becomes real. One meaningful deepening occurs: the signal is invitation, not rescue, forcing acceptance of fusion. Cost is declared (“oxygen reserves dwindle”) but not enacted—no visible symptom or tactic change under deadline. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—provable truth versus inherited disbelief—tightens when each shouted warning has failed; the lattice trick is the last live option. Escalation is causal: because no one believes, therefore he must erase himself. Cost is legible: surrender of voice and identity. The deepening would sharpen further if we sensed one instant of physical peril (a guard’s flashlight beam, a stumble on the reef) to raise visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—debt repayment/memory restoration—tightens exactly once: bead flare→memory flood→she vanishes, narrowing future to solitary remembrance. Agency is hers; the final choice to let go is dramatized by her literal fade. Cost is the reunion itself foreclosed, leaving him holding the warmed relic. Coincidence absent; pressure is internal karmic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: restore/create beauty in place of absent sea. Escalation via deepening texture: each stitch thickens air, stakes shift from survival to reverence. Decision to sew rather than flee narrows options; visible price is exhaustion & indigo-stained fingers. Cost legible but not punishing; orchid solace feels transcendent more than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single stake—recover lineage worth—tightens once: empty socket forces the choice to surrender the last portable relic. Cost is the loss of future mobility implicit in leaving the sundial; she pays by foreclosing exile identity. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word arc; one meaningful turn meets bar.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve unnoticed truth before the letter leaves—stays abstract; the only tightening is the approaching sun that will fade chalk, but Elliot welcomes its erasure. No live option is foreclosed; tactics (code, catalog, mail) remain unchanged. Cost is conceptual at best (the codes will vanish), not felt by character or reader. Agency is ritual repetition, not risk.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the loose thread before the coup”—is signaled early; pressure tightens via candle-flame brightening as each stitch narrows possibility. Cost is conceptual (permanent mask, stories still unheard) rather than visceral; one meaningful deepening, but no live option is foreclosed on the page, holding it shy of 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Finding the moment before deciding” is signaled early and tightens when each droplet narrows possibility to a single unsent line; the protagonist’s agency is attention/ritual endurance rather than decision, but the cost—physical chill, emotional tremor, final exhaustion—is visible and alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“how to read one’s own damage”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via tactile decryption of the cast map, each solved loop tightening Elias’s sense of shared vulnerability. Cost is emotional, not external: reopened “shrapnel” ache felt as map. No false antagonist or coincidence; agency is attention/interpretation under anesthetic haze—sufficient for lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single stake—recover lost joy—tightens once when the vision begins to fade and Elara must accept transience; the felt price is the ache of watching blossoms dissolve back into mist, a visible forfeiture that alters her emotional ledger. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices under Accumulative lens; still, the escalation is brief and could use one more beat of narrowing options to breach 7.3.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“to exchange certainty for curiosity”—is signaled in grinning-man’s first line and deepens when she forfeits the nickel’s tether. Escalation is textural: each bloom adds timbre-density until the garden’s crescendo forces her stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual but legible: she renounces the security of pigment-only reality. No secondary reversal needed; one tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve untaxed thought—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: raid rumor → uprooted beds → lone encoded bloom; each step narrows options. Agency resides in Silas’s refusal to erase; the zigzag marigolds are his visible wager. Price paid: physical destruction of beds, future exposure etched into the surviving petal.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—will pain ever bloom into beauty?—is declared early; pressure deepens via insomnia, drafts, postcard glow, blossom apparition. One tightening beat: fingertip touch dissolves hoarded pain, foreclosing perpetual sorrow. Cost is emotional (awe replaces ache), but no tangible loss alters later tactics; centuries of endurance function as mythic stasis, not escalating trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—is signaled early and tightens once: the price becomes personal memory, not just effort. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: each sung note empties the singer. No false reversals; coincidence merely complicates (the original hesitation). The cost is visible—caretaker feels “a little emptier”—but the pressure plateaus rather than spikes again.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before paths diverge—telegraphed early and tightened by each promise; the fourth vow (“stay even when easier to leave”) forecloses flight. Escalation is lyrical but causal: each line of ink shrinks the option of retreat until the well’s explosion makes silence impossible. Cost is legible: physical shard risk on the floor, emotional nakedness as she steps forward. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is time + her own fear, both overcome by the final hand-grab.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—town’s water need vs. sacrificial guilt—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the analyzer spits “the town’s thirst is a blade.” The midpoint revelation of the 39th link forecloses a maximal-release option, forcing the recalibration. Cost is legible: he accepts perpetual personal oversight to keep the gate at 39/77 capacity. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of the lost lullaby—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the chip is lashed to the pigeon: failure means eternal silence. Escalation is accretive: each flight log, dust pattern, and frantic wing-beat thickens the risk until the bird’s hesitation becomes the final pressure test. Cost is visible—once the chip leaves his hand, the meteorite and melody are literally out of reach—yet the tightening is single-arc rather than a second reversal, so ceiling is mid-8. No coincidence resolves; the launch is wholly agent-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake ("belonging") is declared early but remains abstract; no external obstacle or time shortage narrows options. Escalation is atmospheric—machinery awakens, plankton brighten—yet Elara’s agency is limited to activating switches; she neither risks error nor sacrifices an alternative path. Consequently pressure plateaus rather than tightens: coincidence (Kaelen appears) replaces a consequential choice. Cost is absent on-page, so the beat qualifies as a cadence shift, not a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightened when empty seeds appear. Escalation is accumulative: each colored bloom adds evidence, but the empty circles deliver the decisive reframe. Agency is observational rather than active; Aelia’s conjecture is sparked by external seed-drop, not a choice that risks loss. Conceptual cost is felt, but no live option is foreclosed for her today.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to prove randomness can be sculpted—tightens when the stranger hijacks his script, forcing him to share authorship. The escalation is one smooth rise: each busker accident narrows audience attention until the midnight bell becomes the single moment when either pattern or chaos wins. Cost is visible: Elias’s private symphony becomes public spectacle, and the next blank night now requires an even riskier gambit. No reversal beyond the single turn of the key, but it is sufficient and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: transform self into uncontainable scripture or remain exiled. Pressure tightens through density of star-gap observations and dust dissolution; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening: moonstone speck liquefies, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible—skin burns, anchor loosens—yet escalation is accumulative rather than sharply reversive, fitting lens.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: censorship vs. unbannable knowledge encoded in cellular gaps. Subtext in gesture—vein-light, obsidian reflections—avens nostalgia without naming it. Final image reweights “ban” itself as obsolete. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about how scripture will rewrite world.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—capture fleeting beauty before daylight erases it—signaled early and intensifies via countdown refrain. Pressure is situational: sun is unavoidable antagonist; glazier’s agency is attention, not intervention. No tightening of options, only deepening of pattern; cost is existential (loss of delicate seeing) not tactical. Sufficient escalation for lyric-accumulative design, but lacks visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elias carry the bell’s guilt without being consumed? Pressure tightens once—box warms, memory surges, he decides to keep walking. No external antagonist is needed; internal escalation is sufficient for 700-word scope. The cost is conceptual (perpetual guardianship) rather than visceral, capping the score just below the 8.8 band that demands a sharper tangible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can hope be systematized—tightens when tide threatens to erase her equations, forcing acceptance of entropy as variable. Escalation is textural: each gauge twitch raises perceived altitude of possibility, culminating in symbol that reweights entire project. No external antagonist, but internal conflict (order vs. flux) is pressured by environmental encroachment. Cost is conceptual—she must launch untested equations into public realm—felt in final upward needle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he survive the walls’ dream-archive?—tightens when the woman’s blurred face warns him; options narrow to “return to map them” or be swallowed. Agency is perceptual: he chooses to keep listening, forfeiting safety. Cost is felt (heart pounding, pocket burns). Under Accumulative lens, ivy/rust/negative density escalates until the whispered name crystallizes stance. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (finding the strip) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can she fix a future in pigment before the bell shatter?”—is announced by line 3 and tightens with each bell-vibration mention. Agency is present-tense endurance: her calm brushwork is defiance against time, not a reaction to external antagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs when the borrowed heartbeat accelerates, narrowing option to surrender the mirage rather than keep painting—an internal trade-off with felt cost. Coincidence (child passing) complicates rather than rescues, preserving causality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—voice the dead or remain their passive accomplice—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens with each name spoken; options narrow from thousands to zero remaining. Escalation is Accumulative: density of spoken names increases emotional cost rather than external jeopardy, sufficient for this lens. Visible price is legible—trembling voice, clipboard growing heavier, sunlight becoming “absolution”—meeting the 8.8+ gate. No coincidence resolves tension; the sun’s alignment merely frames the self-imposed deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can he relinquish control of extinction he engineered—tightens once: from owning the last egg to releasing its molecules into the drought-scape he owns. The tightening is textural, not causal, but the audible echo that now haunts the flats is an undeniable, irreversible price. No antagonist needed; the conflict is between archive and erasure, resolved by the rain that will dissolve both salt and footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—own her voice versus the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and tightens when the red thread threatens to undo her. The single deepening (snapping that thread) forecloses the option of remaining “desired and untouched,” but the price, while felt, is not given a concrete after-image that would narrow later options; escalation is legible yet once-only.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—who controls narrative truth—tightens as Elias moves from commissioned safety to subversive bars; the final freeing of the puppets forecloses his authorial grip with visible cost (loss of control, stick abandoned). Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but the deepening pattern reweights stakes effectively under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: honor the last monarch passage before obliteration; pressure escalates as each new corpse joins the weave, narrowing options toward acceptance. Agency remains observant-reflexive rather than proactive, yet the pattern of inclusion vs. preservation tightens the emotional cost to the final “dissolution” promise.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—”preserve forgotten names or remain frozen in guilt”—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each loosened hair-fiber adds sonic density until the murmur becomes choir. The caster’s agency is continuous—every re-knot decisions narrows physical options (rope frays, cold bites) and emotional exits (forgiveness or silence). Cost is visible: ancestral hair is irreversibly re-patterned, aurora light consumes the sanctum’s darkness, the caster leaves carrying their voices inside his emptied chest.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the failing directive—tightens once when he learns repair is futile and must transcend instead. Agency is legible: he chooses to sit and merge, forfeiting any future escape. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—eternal bond to the machine—felt in the final pure tone. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope; no secondary reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“decode before inspectors arrive”—is signaled in line 3 and tightens with each star that pricks the vault. The single meaningful escalation is the once-in-a-century alignment; every beat after that reduces slack until palm-on-tile forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: once the covenant is sealed, Elias forfeits institutional safety and becomes cosmic vassal. Under causal lens, escalation is clean; no reversal is required, only the narrowing of temporal option.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: imperfect music must still release resentment— signaled in paragraph 2. Tightening occurs when the box returns heavier after each absorption; cost is felt as Elias’s pocket sags. Agency is accumulative—he chooses to extend the box, but no single beat escalates personal risk. Because the box auto-returns, external constraint never narrows his options; tension is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will the dream return?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density: each exhale thickens the fog-glass interface, narrowing possibility from scattered shards to sealed dome. No reversal or price is exacted from Elian; the dream simply alights. Escalation is textural, not tactical, so the beat feels like deepening atmosphere rather than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can ritual mend a severed filial bond? Pressure tightens once: soil burial of relics narrows options from abstract hope to literal patience. No antagonist; escalation is accretive density, not causality. Cost is conceptual—acceptance of endless wait—felt in the exhale of vaulted ceiling; price alters stance rather than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“inherit knowledge without erasing self”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density, not cause: each orchard visit layers more versions of Margaret until identity blurs, a textbook accumulative tightening. Cost is conceptual (loss of linear self) rather than visceral; because no live option is foreclosed on the page, the band stalls just below 7.0. The requirement for one meaningful deepening is met, yet the price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Kael—hovers from the first sentence. Pressure tightens once: the realization that the diary is a foundational text *from* the library forces Elara to risk rewriting the mountain’s grammar. That act is irreversible and freighted with conceptual cost (the mountain groans, the wall dissolves). The escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope; luck is absent; agency is pure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reach the garden—remains constant; pressure escalates via textured accumulation (carousel horses flicker between grin & grimace, fog thickens). Yet no live trade-off is forced; the ship’s groan is protest, not refusal, so tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore lost stories to present clarity—is signaled early and tightened when each braid twist brightens the rear door. Agency is present but abstract: re-configuring rope is the tangible act that narrows options. Cost is conceptual (library dissolves, seal permanently fused) rather than visceral; no credible loss of tool or stamina is shown. Still, the final tick now “holds space,” a legible re-weighting under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm”—is clear early; pressure intensifies via sensory density rather than option loss. No reversal or trade-off is risked; success is immediate, so escalation is textural deepening only. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove meaning inside ruin—is declared early and tightened when the shard must be coaxed to amplify rather than shatter. Escalation is accretive: each celestial alignment increases chance of dispersal; the humming pavilion rises in pitch, audible pressure. Agency is present—Kaelen rotates the ring—but the decisive turn is interior (accept imperfection) more than external risk. Cost is conceptual: silence converted to light; felt but not bodily, capping climb just below the 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory before fog erases it—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Kael realizes the fog has its own timeline. One meaningful deepening: shadow geometry mismatch forces him to trust fog-time, foreclosing reliance on sun-based certainty. Cost is legible: the clarity he will lose when fog lifts is felt preemptively, and the dawn melt makes that loss real. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—are signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory filtration and mosaic revelation, narrowing options toward the single decisive spin of fire; the tightening is meaningful, though the external cost (one rag, one flame) is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—will the difficult conversation happen?—is signaled early but remains abstract; the tide, not character agency, supplies the only visible escalation. No option is foreclosed; Elian’s monologue merely fills the pause until water unites the pools. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of transition) but not viscerally paid. One tightening beat exists—the cicada placement—but it does not narrow future choices or risk loss.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—collect silence flavors—escalates through progressive absorption of sharper, older strata until the seedling-sound thread marks the irreversible saturation point. The single meaningful tightening is the moment gravity returns: options collapse from limitless sky to one closing lift door, price paid in shattering the gilded hush. Protagonist agency drives every stage: she chooses exposure level, ascends, sifts, stops, descends. No coincidence; the inversion hour is external pressure but her harvesting method and final internalization are wholly authored.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake is single—restore acoustic balance—signalled early. Pressure accumulates via vial clouding and hum deepening, but the tightening is atmospheric, not strategic; no option is closed, no tactic altered, no visible price exacted. Escalation is textural, which fits the lens, yet lacks a beat where Elara must renounce or risk something tangible. Peace arrives as gift, not trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode before purge—tightens at each ruby-flake cue; sunrise acts as live countdown shown in “precious minutes fading.” Escalation is causal: each peeled layer reveals deeper stakes (exile → ancestral guilt → species wisdom). Final refusal costs personal glory, paying visible price. No coincidence; pressure grows through protagonist’s micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—keep contamination out vs. risk re-connection—signals early and tightens once: the threshold’s audible thinning escalates from ambience to survival threat. Agency is present but abstract; the encroachment is described, not demonstrated narrowing her options beat-by-beat. Cost is conceptual rather than felt: the price of knocking is asserted (“risk being unable to breathe”) rather than dramatized through breath, pulse, or failing barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmute regret into value—tightens once when the bolt humps soil and crystallizes; agency is present, cost is legible, but escalation is a single beat rather than a narrowing sequence, keeping it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single stake—truth vs. dynasty—tightens through each crank escalation. Agency is interior but active: turning the handle is the on-page trade-off that reweights legacy. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“possibility itself”—stays abstract, but the text repeatedly literalizes it: fruits pulse brighter when knight nears center; gear-removal triggers dawn-shatter. One meaningful tightening occurs at the gear unsnap, foreclosing the “endless night” option and paying visible conceptual cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: density of glowing imagery increases until pattern rupture. Lacks a palpable personal loss (no flesh cost), so escalation feels aesthetic rather than visceral; still, agency is clear and coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—rescue forgotten kindness—is steadily tightened through each found marginalium; agency tracks Elias’s archival sleuthing, but escalation is incremental pattern-build rather than a single high-cost turn, so pressure is coherent yet modest.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes—“make erased history reappear”—are declared early and tested in the ninety-second intrusion that forecloses Maya’s anonymity. Escalation is linear but effective: Jenna missing → puddle signal → booth boot-up → broadcast → sirens. The tightening is technological, not personal, so the cost feels external; still, the lens holds and the visible price (state hunt) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—prevent the town’s collective amnesia—is signaled in line 1 and escalates as spontaneous prophesied notes appear in public spaces.
    The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes “this morning was critical”; the prism atrium becomes the last choke-point where silence must out-sound the final note.
    Agency is continuous—every silence he inserts is an active decision that narrows future options, culminating in the permanent commitment to return tomorrow forever.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“decode the dust or remain a passive archivist”—is signaled early and tightens when the prod incarnates a memory-keeper. The reversal (sprite → leaf → keys) narrows Elias’s options from curiosity to custodial burden; the price is the irrevocable loss of anonymity as his room becomes an open conduit for lost worlds. Cost is visible: “his room no longer felt small but infinite,” a spatial price that forecloses his quiet life. Agency is micro but sufficient for 700 words; the escalation is accumulative/textural rather than causal-chain, and it reweights the stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“how to live with unfixable time”—is signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs when the whole backward clock appears: it forecloses repair as a path, forcing surrender. Cost is visible: relinquishing satchel of parts into the pool; persistent constraint is the compass’s new arbitrary north. Escalation remains situational, coherent under lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can he transmute regret into workable forward motion—tightens once when he decides to melt the coin’s chip into gold. Escalation is textural/density-driven rather than causal reversal; cost is conceptual (accepting imperfection) rather than tangible loss. Agency is present but solitary and low-velocity; a single deepening suffices and lands, yet pressure never spikes sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are spiritual-aesthetic: will the next soul laugh before dissolving? Each confession tightens the emotional cost on the collector, deepening rather than widening conflict. No antagonist or reversal is needed under the Accumulative lens; pattern break is the sunrise turning the gorge from dissonant to lullaby. The visible price—pressing the tooth into earth—cements the earned exhaustion.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: sorrow and joy are interdependent frequencies, healed through co-performance. Laughter is never moralized; it surfaces as sonic gold threads, letting complexity linger. Final image of the gorge as “symphony of release” re-prices earlier darkness without sermon. The prompt’s “luminous ache” is felt, not named as thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“find the formula for mercy”—is signaled early and tightened when the forest’s light reacts to the equation, proving the hypothesis testable. One meaningful deepening: mercy flips from absence of pain to deliberate counter-action, narrowing Kael’s moral toolkit to active intervention. Cost is legible: he must perpetually inhabit the mask-ghost to keep the integral live. Escalation is intellectual yet visceral, fitting causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover erased women translators—announced early; each canvas discovery tightens density, foreclosing ignorance as an option. No explicit antagonist; pressure is archival erasure, escalated by found images. Cost visible: she embraces lifelong, possibly isolating, labor.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will he break eternity’s cage?”—is signaled in frost line one. Escalation is single-track but effective: each frost message narrows his tactical options until the lever-pull costs his lifelong identity. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Meets 9-band test: agency drives the turn and the price (library’s blank frost, his empty hands) is legible on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the civilization’s hidden tenderness—tightens when academic narrative threatens to erase it. One meaningful deepening: shard shifts from “ritual bowl?” to “wildflower vessel,” narrowing Kaelen’s options to subterfuge. Agency drives escalation: his decision to veil mirrors triggers the vision that forecloses institutional path. Cost is felt: he accepts permanent marginalization to keep the memory alive.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is clear; pressure escalates via lunar twilight and dimming stone, but Elara’s agency is ritualistic (he follows inherited method) rather than risk-laden invention; no live option is closed to him except failure. Town-scale stakes dwarf personal cost, muting the felt price at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reaching the place where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle swings toward water, foreclosing retreat. The lagoon’s magnetic pull is the single meaningful escalation that forces Elias’s stance crystallization; cost is the abandonment of his lifetime collection paradigm. Agency is present yet subtle; a hair more visible price would lift higher.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: discover whether her wanderings mean anything. Pressure escalates texturally—each glowing image re-weights her past sculptures rather than narrows external options. No concrete loss or trade-off is risked; the storm never truly endangers her. Cost is purely conceptual recognition, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she crack why night-flowers bloom—tightens when chapel glass proves the adaptation strategy, foreclosing her prior romantic mystery. Agency is accumulative: each season of painting and card study adds pressure until she must choose between private myth and public ecosystem truth; the mural reinterpretation is that choice. Cost is conceptual rather than external—she forfeits the delicious secrecy of “anomaly” for communal scientific wonder. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: revelation belongs to those willing to inhabit darkness. Subtext lives in repeated postcard handwriting “the garden doesn’t sleep,” silently countering her early loneliness. No moralizing finale; instead the painted ecosystem reframes prior images without exposition. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—visitors sense murals breathing at twilight, inviting reader to stay after lights dim.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncover buried civil-rights voices—tightens when each arranged word costs physical risk and retrocognitive immersion. One meaningful deepening: “HELP” vision ups stakes from curiosity to surrogacy for the vanished. Persistent constraint: lagoon eats memory, so every deciphered name erases Eli’s own future options. Cost visible on page: diary ink bleeds onto skin, ribs tattooed, archive file labeled “Recovered Voices” yet contaminated.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—founding a living civilization—signals early. Single meaningful tightening occurs when lanterns dim under his hesitation, forcing the balance decision; cost is legible but lightweight (no personal loss beyond effort). Escalation is purely accumulative: each memory adds a town-quarter; no external opposition or reversed option appears. Agency remains internal-conceptual rather than risking anything external.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. release the archived emotions—tightens once: the wax decoding reveals the archive is a growing entity, forcing Elias’s surrender. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (silence, warm wax, rustling leaves) increases psychic density until stasis is earned. Cost is felt but not externally priced; the city still sleeps, no tool or relationship is lost. Sufficient for this length, yet shy of 8.2+ threshold that demands a visible price altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the texture of borrowed time—is signaled early and tightened when the floor opens inward. Protagonist agency is high: every beat is her deliberate ritual act. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of ancestral urgency—but legible on-page. No secondary pressure or tangible loss, so escalation stays lyric-moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—communal survival via timely warning—threads early and tightens when wind-shift signals an incoming electrical storm. One meaningful deepening: electronic siren fractures in thin air, forcing fall-back to bell; this narrows options and amplifies personal responsibility. Cost is opportunity: Elian forfeits rest and embraces perpetual lone vigil, but the price is stated more than viscerally felt. Agency remains sequential—test, switch, log—rather than a single decisive gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: maintain empathic communion or retreat into isolation. Escalation is textural—each meteor shower intensifies the lantern’s glow and Elara’s spiritual risk. No external antagonist; pressure is existential, tightening until the glass empties itself, forcing her into perpetual receptivity. Cost legible: she accepts endless vulnerability in exchange for cosmic connection.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the covenant against fracturing ghosts—is signaled early and tightens through color shifts and bee patterns. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than combat: Elisha’s nightly ritual forecloses the option of expelling newcomers. Cost is conceptual (risk of fracture) rather than visceral; the price would sharpen if the ritual demanded a concrete sacrifice. Escalation is gradual—one meaningful deepening at dusk—sufficient for lyric-accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“will Elias piece together the lost record before his own time expires?”—is clear early, yet pressure stays flat: each garage-sale clue obediently yields the next piece without resistance, cost, or time leak. The sole tightening is informational, not tactical; options never narrow, and the borrowed-time heartbeat never forces a sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—unlock architectural secrets before death—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens accumulatively: each wrapped branch adds resonance, visitors “sense something,” wire glows at sunset; options narrow to acceptance. No external reversals, but that fits Accumulative lens. Visible cost is Kaelen’s dwindling strength and eventual death, felt in tremulous hands; price alters capacity rather than tactics, keeping escalation gentle but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: transform sterile “artificial pilgrimage” into authentic homecoming. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification: each new set of footprints thickens the textural evidence until the amber’s placement flips skepticism into belief—one decisive tightening. Cost is the irreversible surrender of the mentor-gift and the solitude that follows. No mechanical reversals needed; the accretion of traces does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the drowned concord—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each seed-scatter beat; the tern’s cry “Now” forces immediate action, narrowing options to scatter-or-keep. Cost is legible: the coachman gives away the last pods, foreclosing his own sacramental hoard. Escalation is accumulative: pattern of seed, tide, bird call intensifies texture until the luminescent roots reweight the stake. No reversal, but single meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—sister’s fate—signalled on page 1. Escalation is single but meaningful: thermal groove transfer that forecloses the “silent cylinder” path and forces tomorrow’s dawn stake-out. Cost is conceptual (hope now externalized) rather than viscerally paid on-page, so 8.8+ is capped. Agency is Elias’s technical tweak, not a moral gamble, keeping tension cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can he convert isolation into meaningful navigation?—tightens once: the ghost sky appears, forcing the switch from remembrance to discovery. That single reversal narrows his options to “map or sink,” a visible trade-off paid by abandoning the half-finished memory sketch. Agency remains causal under the lens; coincidence (the shimmer) complicates but does not save him. A crisper material loss—charcoal snapped, parchment torn—would have pushed the cost to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent a joyless world—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when Kaelen palms the king. The swap ritual is the one meaningful escalation: each piece narrows options until “You win” cracks the sky. Cost is visible: Kaelen loses sanctuary, Architect loses control. A sharper tangible price (a bleeding fingertip on the ivory?) would have pushed higher, but the conceptual forfeiture is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased stories via small gestures—signals in sentence-3 and deepens with each traced word; tightening occurs when missing pawns force her to write “survive” rather than merely observe. Escalation is textural: each spelled word adds moral weight; the final “remember” is the visible forfeit of anonymity (she leaves legible evidence). Agency remains hers; no external coincidence. Cost (knees, breath, exposure) is legible; could be sharper for 8.5+ but meets 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—substitute unendurable memories with a walkable home-reality—signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each seeding intensifies the thunder inside, shelves conspire, map shifts to “state of being,” foreclosing return. Cost is felt (physical drain, growing irreversibility) but not yet concrete—loss still prospective. Meets 600-word scale; one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early and tightened by each lethal mis-step on the grid. One meaningful reversal: realizing the stalemate he once botched is now solvable. Cost is conceptual (admission of arrogance) rather than external; visible price would push it above 8.2. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: keep vs unleash the contained truth. Escalation is the graduated poetic refracting that fatigues the spire; each session is a visible tightening visible in the sketches. Final cost: the spire cracks, Elaran forfeits innocence and communal silence. Agency remains his throughout—no coincidence, only cumulative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—escalate via each golden stitch; the 137th-day star fall → child’s tear → clockmaker birth sequence tightens the weave, forcing the alchemist to keep speaking while submerged. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the price (corrosion, drowning risk) is more ambient than viscerally paid in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. release—telegraphed via secret shell by line four; pressure tightens when cave solitude forces confrontation with reflective tide pool. One meaningful deepening: pool mirror offers unbroken reflection, confronting his fractured studio mirror memory; lowering the shell narrows options to irrevocable loss of artifact. Cost is pigment clouding the water and the tactile lightness of his leaving—felt on-page. No external antagonist needed; tension is interior and accumulative under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers trump shouts—faces one decisive test: will purified intent survive transmission? Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (salt, heat, garden scent) intensifies the wager until the cork’s lift forecloses retrieval. Cost is legible: Elias trades certainty for possibility, a price felt in the “profound calm” that replaces earlier screaming tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the geography of loss—tightens when the censer foot grows hot, forcing the final line that edges “where the sea had taken everything.” Escalation is textural: each sensory echo (patch, moon phase, phone silence) accretes until refusal is the only possible stance. No live antagonist, yet environmental decay and grief’s tide supply coherent pressure. Visible cost is the forfeiture of the midnight-call crutch; future navigation will ache without that phantom voice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mental privacy—surfaces in line 3 and tightens when the stranger’s proximity threatens instant exposure. The glass-eye trial is the single decisive turn: it narrows options from “share nothing” to “share the relic itself,” a visible price paid on the page. Storm pressure externalizes the ticking clock, forbidding retreat. Cost is palpable: imperfect occlusion means lifelong partial exposure, foreclosing perfect solitude forever.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: witness isolation vs. shared connection; signaled early, deepens as Hemlock decodes stranger’s gesture. Pressure intensifies through accruing memory-fragments, not external opposition—an acceptable Accumulative tightening. No visible price paid beyond emotional confirmation; cost is conceptual (perpetual caretaking) rather than concrete forfeiture, keeping it below high band. One meaningful cadence shift: private grief → public tribute.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—escape from vicarious living—signaled in opening “weight of their silence.” Escalation is textural: each new sense detail (chip glow, jasmine, fungal pulse) deepens the cost of continued avoidance. One meaningful tightening: pressing chip into rock forecloses return to spectator life; price is exposure to unmapped future. Agency remains Elias’s at every beat; coincidence (ants) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—identity versus crown—signaled early; pressure tightens once when memory floods back, foreclosing mortal future. Agency is her decision to ascend and later to abandon; price (kingdom fracture) is legible in the final thunder-crack, though escalation is more conceptual than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture density of presence—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the secret demands revaluation, foreclosing her former interpretive frame. Escalation under causal lens: whisper → refract → weave → star, each step raises stakes by making memory irreversible. Cost legible: she must now carry the star’s weight, a literalized burden. No abstract stakes; every intensification is tethered to tactile light-threads.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—own approaching death—signaled in paragraph 1 and re-inked on every scroll line. Pressure escalates by accumulation: each remembered future shrinks present possibility until only the writing act remains. No reversal, but a meaningful cadence shift when he steps outside and tastes “cleaner” air—option space reweighted from claustrophobic cabin to open sky with cost still legible. Agency is endurance/renunciation; refusal to surrender to paralysis is paid for with the irreversible grave-date.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of foreknowledge: hindsight from the future can poison or liberate the present. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers tracing uncompleted grave date, breath visible like phantom words—rather than overt thesis. Final image of “beginning again” reframes chronological chaos as freedom, reweighting prior jealousy into rebellion without moralizing. Some abstraction lingers (“most beautiful rebellion”), but resonance holds because the scroll and grave particulars ground the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she re-enter life without smell?—tightens when the screw’s inscription forces a choice: keep grieving or appropriate the grandmother’s “ordinary miracles.” The single deepening is sufficient; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is legible: she forfeits her refuge of numbness, signalled by steady hands returning to the wrench. Pressure accrues under the accumulative lens rather than causal reversals, meeting the lens-governed bar for escalation.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: water drops, thread-worn screw, cedar ghost. No moralizing—just the final inhalation that re-prices prior emptiness. The grandmother’s transmutation of loss into delivered life quietly asks whether Elara can do likewise, leaving plausible counter-readings. The trembling calm modulates into steady hope without sentimentality, landing a resonant after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turn inner scars into readable stories—activates with first sip of tea and escalates as skin literally becomes parchment. The tightening occurs when crystallization fuses quill to hand: no retreat possible, every stroke costs literal flesh. Storm arrival externalizes the pressure, but the real squeeze is irreversible self-modification. Cost is visible: crystal tear gem, dulled quill, cold tea—each a forfeiture that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—deliver the apology before the orchard falls and the ghosts scatter—is declared early. Pressure tightens once: the induced-current gamble could destroy the last link to Alistair; failure is named as “losing him forever.” The device’s hum escalates risk, forcing her irreversible plunge. Cost is paid on-page: the bottle’s glow dies, the whispers fall silent, her chance for forgiveness ends—either succeed now or carry guilt permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared (“unravel cosmic illusions”) but never localize into a concrete risk or irreversible fork; the protagonist faces no live test, only ritual choreography. Pressure is static awe—every sentence inflates the same sublime note—so no meaningful tightening, deepening, or cadence shift occurs. Agency is purely metaphoric: he “releases the accumulated burden” rather than choosing against an alternative. Under Accumulative lens, the required density-increase never arrives; the hymn simply loops.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: “what do these instruments truly capture?” Pressure tightens once via backwards-count ritual that reveals stutter, forcing Elias to choose between official precision and lived anomaly. Cost visible: embracing the illusion exposes his life’s work as artifice, paid in social estrangement. Escalation causal, single meaningful turn sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: can Elias abandon intrusion-detection rigidity for permeable connection? Pressure tightens only once—her laser test invites him to “open the door.” The stakes remain conceptual; no tangible loss is risked or paid. Escalation is gentle but coherent under accumulative lens; the final glow reweights the stake rather than narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—daughter must crack father’s certainty—tightens when each graffiti fragment is added to the notebook, narrowing his escape routes. Cost is present but indirect: her guilt, his swallowed pride. No tangible loss (money, reputation) is risked or forfeited on-page, keeping it shy of 8.8 band. Escalation is accumulative/textural, pattern-break is the tonal shift inside library.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: maintain the loop that turns strangers’ endings into beginnings while keeping his own estrangement absolute. Pressure tightens once: the disc’s final phrase each dawn reminds him he too could dial out, but he renounces that exit nightly; the cost is the accrued sonic residue that replaces a lived life. Escalation is accumulative—each 3:47 deposit thickens the disc’s timbre—rather than a causal reversal, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory vs. surrender it—tightens once, at the final beat. The annual ritual supplies escalating pattern; tonight’s twist is the documentation of proximate causes that forces the renunciation. Cost is visible: the jetty recedes, locket swallowed, path foreclosed. Agency is renunciation under coherent pressure; no outside coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—cure loneliness via reciprocal exchange—tightens when moon payment fails to yield person, forcing ascent. One meaningful deepening: external quest switches to internal attention; cost is forfeited mobility and relinquished moon fragment. Escalation causal: each failed transaction narrows option field until only listening remains. Price visible on page: "logistician...had to learn how to stay still."

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—quiet the internal storm—signals early and tightens with each note: C minor → G sharp → B flat progressively narrows external noise to internal silence. Agency is present: Kael chooses to kneel under the B-flat blow, accepting the cost of silence. No external antagonist needed; conflict is situational-pressure vs. endurance. Visible price: the ring cools, the forest hush becomes irreversible, foreclosing his former mapmaker identity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—edit history vs. accept flawed growth—tightens once when the interpreter writes *“The seed was never planted”* then erases it, paying the micro-cost of restored anomaly gravity. Agency is cerebral but real: the decision to keep the weeds narrows future options to perpetual revision. Cost is felt: the anomaly lessens “just enough” but never vanishes, a persistent price. No coincidence; all pressure stems from the interpreter’s own prior mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the forgotten be remembered?”—is signaled early and escalates by accretion: each click deepens the stakes of silence without external plot turns. The tightening is felt when the camera’s purpose flips from witness to metronome, but the absence of any live obstacle or trade-off keeps pressure lyrical rather than visceral. Cost is conceptual (they leave with only unhearable songs), yet because no option is ever foreclosed, the escalation feels like beautiful drift, not squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“keep the shared dream from evaporating”—tightens when drumming shifts from defiant to life-sustaining, foreclosing the option to sabotage the experiment. Cost is visible: he forfeits solitary rebellion for communal custodianship, tear-streak literal on page. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens, sufficient for length. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the bet. Agency sits in Kael’s decision to whisper and to surrender the coin; both acts foreclose paths with visible cost. Escalation is single but meaningful: Jenna’s shout fails, Kael’s whisper succeeds, storm peaks as door opens—causality intact. No off-stage cheats; coincidence merely ornaments.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Anna’s unread grief—surfaces early; the guardian’s quiet accumulation of shutter angles provides the single tightening that converts private sorrow into legible message. Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost is Anna’s tearful recognition, foreclosing her silence; escalation stops there, satisfying short-form depth.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can quiet wonder subvert compliant silence?—is voiced early and tightened by each mis-en-place beat; the escalation is density-driven, not causal, matching the Accumulative lens. The only felt price is Arthur’s sleepless circuit, a visible stamina tax that alters his final soft smile. A sharper micro-loss—e.g., a cracked lens or overheard cop—could have pushed cost legibility into 8.8 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. belonging—signals early; escalation is driven by scrimshaw glow and whale-call density, each return narrowing options. The final detachment costs her the island’s community, but because the island’s demand was narrated rather than dramatized, the price feels conceptual more than visceral; still, it forecloses a live option under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve contraband memory under surveillance—tightens once: the unscheduled knock converts routine ritual into immediate jeopardy. Elara’s agency is the carving hand that keeps the flowers alive; the cost is the perpetual risk of discovery, made visceral when the inspector’s footsteps could have ended everything. Escalation is a single deepening, but it is meaningful and lens-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“to stride through boundaries once thought sacred”—tightens through tactile tests: failed notebooks → palm-to-quartz risk → full dissolution. Each escalation is a deepening of the same stake rather than a new problem, satisfying accumulative lens. Visible price is the sloughing of embodied form and former poetic voice. No secondary antagonist needed; the colonnade’s frequency is the coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trading season-long labor for sight—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Lyra points heart → sky, forcing Leo’s lily bid that seals the contract. Escalation is causal: each new plant added raises the social price of failure; the reed’s hum is the irreversible turn that forecloses gray neutrality. Cost is visible: lifelong servitude inscribed in the courtyard soil. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is want vs. irreversible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates by density, not reversal: each refraction, tremor, and harmonic adds strata to the same question. The struck fork’s transparent note is the single cadence shift that makes silence audible, foreclosing the idea that only sound can connect. Cost is conceptual but legible: the pilgrimage flips from archival to generative, leaving the lens dimmed and the bell-ringer stance-changed. Agency remains interior yet causal under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled in paragraph one: “possibilities where their loved ones lived on.” Pressure escalates through micro-turns: stencil moves from personal memorial to instructional tool; pendants move from private grief to public invitation. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—Elian surrenders exclusive paternal memory to become an anonymous guide—yet the price feels real because the narrative refuses him any later scene of private remembrance. One tightening beat is missing: the moment he first offers a pendant to a stranger and risks rejection or misunderstanding; instead the network is declared successful, blunting the final stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—can Elara prove the crashes are cultural rituals—remains conceptual; the tightening comes when Chen arrives and she risks academic ridicule, but that social cost is asserted, not dramatized. No lived option is foreclosed; she confides, he approves, the work continues. The twenty-year cycle is intriguing yet abstract; the story never stages a consequence that would make failure tangible. Pressure accumulates intellectually rather than viscerally, adequate for an accumulative design but short of a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: keep shadows attached by preserving hope. Tightening occurs when Elara realizes hope literally fragments; cost is felt as “luminous regret.” Agency is methodical—she integrates new protocols and accepts lifelong burden. Pressure plate is single but sufficient for this length; option space narrows to “vigilance or loss.”

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can she salvage moral integrity after wholesale deception”—is signaled early and tightens once: the option of “moving on” is rejected, foreclosing the easy path. No reversals needed; the single deepening (realizing she must audit every rescue) is sufficient for 700-word scale. Agency is continuous: each page turn is a micro-choice that escalates exposure of fraud. Cost is manifest: the twentieth-anniversary gala flips from celebration to funeral.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—erase vs read scars—is signaled early; pressure tightens when plant telepathy reframes her work as theft of stories. No external antagonist; the escalation is conceptual, landing via Samuel’s restored scars and Maya’s apology. Cost is felt, but the turn is more revelation than irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—will he locate the storage site of lost love—tightens when the search narrows from “where” to “when,” a conceptual narrowing that still forecloses his lifelong dread of evaporation. Cost is present but abstract: he accepts that his own unused love is already archived in a cut he cannot undelete. The escalation is purely epistemic, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet the price would be sharper if his body or memory paid something more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—signaled first paragraph. Escalation via accumulative pattern: each meteor traced tightens the possibility of release (visible stardust swirl, louder bone-whisper) until the final blaze reveals the “door.” Protagonist agency drives every increment; no external rescue. Cost is legible in bodily collapse and the quiet after-hum that forecloses immediate writing—an earned stasis. One meaningful intensification sufficient for 700-word piece; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—will consciousness master or be mastered by mechanism?—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: harmonic density grows until self diffuses into tree-gear matrix; options narrow to fusion or madness, though the cost is more intellectual than palpable. Agency remains observational; no concrete forfeiture beyond the irreversible neural sync. Enough tightening to merit mid-high band, yet lacks a visceral price tag that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—locating “unused courage”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete failure cost is risked. Pressure escalates only descriptively: “overlapping horizons” promise revelation yet never foreclose a wrong path. The traveler’s agency is limited to walking and watching; the final retrieval of light is granted, not wrested. Thus escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, and the tightening never costs a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—unmasking illusion—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through pattern accumulation: each note widens court whispers, tightening invisible noose. Agency is accumulative rather than causal: Kael’s final act is release of built-up drift, not new violence. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable—pretender’s essence audibly tears, his golden veneer gone. No visible price to Kael himself keeps this from 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens when console numbers stutter into coastline shapes, forcing Elias to re-price memory itself. Escalation is textural: density of salt, rust, and rhythm accumulates until the atlas folds into blueprint. One visible cost: the station’s creak shifts from dying-whale groan to release-sigh, audible price of letting go. Agency is contemplative but active—three final taps = decision to walk—consistent with situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find meaning in the lull”—is signaled early; escalation is a single deepening: stillness intensifies until stone hum ignites purpose. No external opponent or reversal, but the pressure of silence tightens options under Accumulative lens; cost is the acceptance of quiet listening rather than explosive action, visible in her smile at the end. Would reach 8.8+ if a tangible resource were risked or forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—free destiny versus implanted fate—tightens once when the glyphs reveal twin futures; the amber crack is the irreversible turn that forecloses tradition-as-prison. Cost is legible: ancestral seal broken, ecosystem mutates, Maeva accepts unforeseeable hybrids. Pressure stays causal under the lens; no escalation dip.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—integrate memory without succumbing to freeze—tightens once: hiding the photo → displaying it. The sea-thrift transplant beat deepens knowledge, reweighting survival metaphor. Agency is quiet yet visible; cost is opportunity of continued secrecy foregone. No external antagonist needed; wind and salt function as environmental pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can he remake meaning from ruin?”—tightens once: the decision to sort cards rather than flee. Escalation is textural (density of ruined objects mounts) rather than causal; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost visible: he surrenders the illusion of wholeness and embraces permanent ache. Would benefit from one external obstacle to sharpen trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode time’s stretch—tightens once: the ink’s acceleration forces Kael to internalize the pattern before total loss. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits external proof, accepting impermanence. Agency is present—he uncorks, traces, smiles—but pressure is situational rather than antagonistic; no second tightening beat. Coincidence (vial half-buried) complicates without resolving, allowable under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. frozen peace—signals early and tightens once: uploading the letter forecloses retreat. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens, but escalation is front-loaded; after the terminal flickers, stakes are reiterated in summary rather than intensified through new obstacles or forfeits. Cost is announced (“world crumbling like paper”) rather than felt on-page, so the tightening lacks a visible price that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“create beauty where destruction reigned”—is declared early but never challenged; no visitor, market haggle, or desert threat forces a trade-off. Pressure is atmospheric (wind like gunfire) rather than causal. Escalation is a slow layering of rose luminosity; no option is foreclosed, no price exacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the goddess-echo—tightens once yet decisively: the silence glyphs foreclose retreat; the fisher must pay with his own loneliness. Price is visceral (heart raw under calm) and persistent (spike now haunted). No coincidence; pressure is accumulative/textural—each pocket of quiet deepens the sorrow-density until the tremor breaks free. Sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove double murder—signaled in paragraph two and escalates via each contradiction unearthed. One meaningful tightening: realization that bent nib equals struggle, not grief, collapses safe mourning stance and forces intervention. Protagonist agency drives every inflection; no off-stage rescue. Price paid: acceptance that exposing killer may doom her, charged in the cold weight of the nib-promise.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim meaning from the emergent hush—is signaled early and escalates by texture: each added sand grain tightens the ambient silence until the mandala becomes the last conduit for sound. The single reversal—realizing she must interject, not resist—narrows options and is driven by her agency, with the tile flake as persistent constraint. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the hush shifts but no personal loss is dramatized, keeping the tension cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can a single act of renaming loosen the retrocognitive chokehold? Pressure is situational—memory assaults her, plaza offers only fragments—but agency is steady: each pressed shard is a refusal to surrender the past to despair. No second reversal; the pattern simply accretes. Cost is real but static (cut skin, looped trauma) rather than escalating; hence the tension plateaus rather than tightens toward a final fork.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save the theater—arrives late (paragraph 7) but is quickly braided with Arthur’s encore need. One meaningful tightening: the coin’s warmth signals the amplification of echoes, narrowing tactics to public-reality manipulation. Cost is conceptual—Arthur accepts permanent invisibility—rather than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—silence the psychic noise before erosion—escalates as each somatic flare forces her to cast another color, visibly tiring her. The cost accumulates in sweat and trembling arms, but the absence of a live external antagonist keeps the pressure internal; one sharper moment of near-overload could have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“translate the silence into meaning”—tightens when the opalescent glow rewrites her sensory map, foreclosing the option of mere observation. Escalation is accumulative: each fossil encounter raises the emotional ante until the melody forces stance crystallization. Visible price: she forfeits detached map-maker identity and accepts irreversible conduit role. No coincidence resolves; all pressure emerges from her decision to keep touching relics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“unscramble prophecy to save village”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: each button sorted makes the echo louder, a cadence shift that reweights the stake from doom to possibility. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is ontological—fixed fate vs. open choice. The final image of rising sand visibly forecloses the old fatalism, paying a conceptual cost. Mid-band rather than high because the village’s concrete peril is never tested on-page; risk stays allegorical.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—secure Althea’s future—announced with the coordinate slip; pressure tightens once: cipher creation = irreversible commitment that forecloses his own escape (if seen, he dies; if not, he vanishes anyway). Coincidence absent; antagonistic force is the shadow service itself, represented by the pillbox bait. Cost is visible: he spends his last night crafting a message that will literally self-destruct, trading any chance of reunion for her immunity. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient; this beat satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is the promise’s fulfillment; pressure tightens only once—when the boat appears. Until then, the story accrues atmospheric density rather than narrowing options. The final transfer of the needle is a beat of quiet completion, not costly trade-off; escalation is poetic, not tactical, and the cost is aestheticized rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“why does this place resist decay?”—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the resistance is love-frozen. One meaningful tightening at the nexus: fractures flip from threat to shield, narrowing his options to witness, not repair. Cost is the quiet forfeiture of the numinous thrum; pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping it just below the 8.8+ demand for a sharper price.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—ward off spiritual winter darkness—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each mirror increases cumulative glow, tightening the felt need for secrecy. No external antagonist; pressure is seasonal and social (eccentricity risk). Cost is legible: sleepless labor, invisible authorship, and the gardener’s acceptance of being unthanked. The superintendent’s joining affirms stakes have scaled beyond the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure is steady-state memory-sorrow; no mid-story beat narrows options or raises price. The final reframe is insight, not irreversible action; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Escalation remains flat under Accumulative lens, satisfying the single-deepening requirement but lacking a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconnection to the human weave—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by density: each curve of the sculpture intensifies the prismatic quiet until the spectrum merge becomes inevitable. No external antagonist, but the thinning thread is a credible internal pressure. Cost is conceptual—loss of separateness—made legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—protect humanity from manipulative cosmic signals—is declared early and escalates through data loss, academic infighting, and communal unrest. The subsonic jamming is a decisive, irreversible act that forecloses her covert access and risks career exposure (visible cost: “any direct transmission would be traced”). Escalation is single-track but sufficient for 700-word scale. Coincidence is absent; tension tightens because her own success erases the evidence that justified it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“restore balance to mutinous spatial rifts”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as walls “breathe” and starlight fractures. One meaningful escalation: the act of transfixing at the crescendo narrows options to succeed or die, price visible in her tremoring body.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy via artifact resurrection—is signaled early and deepens through each charcoal stroke. One meaningful tightening: the ribbon’s crimson bleed into mist turns the quarry from mute dump to tear-veiled witness. Protagonist agency is continuous; no external coincidence intervenes. Cost is conceptual: Elias accepts perpetual alienation from living faces to gift the town a mirror. Sufficient for 8-band; lacks a second irreversible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—honor ancestor vs. unleash storm—is signaled early and tightened once: the “dangerous but necessary” coordinate forces the trade-off. Agency is present; Elias’s twist decision narrows options and weakens containment. Cost is conceptual (accepting burden) rather than visceral, adequate for this length but not deeply felt. Escalation is linear, not iterative; one meaningful turn suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“make sense of the impossible disappearances”—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes the flake contains trapped faces. One clear deepening: scaffold map rewrites her nightly ritual into a deliberate hunt for thin places; cost is felt in sleep lost and meager tips traded for obsession. No reversal, but Accumulative escalation suffices under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Jasper will reproduce his father’s manipulative patterns—surfaces early and tightens when Elena proposes “guiding” users. The visible cost is Jasper’s forfeiture of wealth and status when he exits the startup; the circus train offers no compensatory triumph, only stasis. Pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens but lacks a second tightening beat; the fall happens off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the self the mirrors never show—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each tightening circle. The seed’s pulse and lake’s cold are visible prices that alter tactics. Agency is renunciation: surrender to the vortex rather than conquer it, foreclosing emotional avoidance. Warlike serenity complicates rather than resolves, forcing stance crystallization with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—renegotiate the broken covenant—tightens when the static-figure and light-ghost appear; Elias’s agency is to witness, not coerce, forcing a stance crystallization rather than a plot coup. Cost is visible: the white scar flares anew, ozone stings, and the sky keeps its wound (eclipse) but pays a star-tax. Escalation is single yet sufficient: the mirrored pain of the two figures makes merger inevitable, and Elias’s retreat is the only remaining action that retains moral traction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“patch the holes in each other’s souls”—is signaled early and tightens once: the offering dissolves the card and forecloses Elian’s original destiny. Agency is present; the protagonist initiates the trade and pays with tactile cost (root bind, memories influx). Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern densification rather than external antagonist, sufficient for 600-word scope. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening that reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: value vs. values—can Leo trade dead data for living noise? Escalation is one-step but sufficient: the scrap’s appearance tightens his options from “finish inventory” to “defy it,” a visible fork that costs $12K. No antagonist is needed; the quarry’s timed detonations serve as external metronome that keeps pressure ticking. Cost is on-page: the unpaid invoice glows on the tablet while the cloth vanishes into his pocket, a literal subtraction from the estate’s ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the seed before grief erodes purpose—is signaled early; pressure tightens when germination happens in minutes, foreclosing the option to wait for safety protocols. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she trades certainty for a leap into unknown continuation. Under causal lens this is sufficient, but the absence of external risk (station failure, authority, etc.) keeps escalation intellectual, not visceral, capping high-band entry. Agency is present yet abstract—she kneels and communes, but no tangible price is dramatized on her body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via cyclical ritual—signaled early, but pressure stays ambient, not acute; no beat where failure feels possible. Escalation is tonal thickening rather than option-narrowing; the creel’s emptying and ink-making unfold smoothly without counter-force or risk. Cost is poetic (“tomorrow disappears”) yet not dramatized as loss on page. Under accumulative lens, cadence shift from observation to inscription suffices for minor tightening, but no tactical consequence alters next cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—dissolve emotional bunker walls—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when Elias publicly risks his reputation with the shell ritual; cost is visible (tears, flesh-touch, nightly self-exposure). One meaningful deepening: the pearl’s glow shifts from private lure to communal ceiling, forcing a collective stance. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; no luck resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early and tightens when graffiti warnings force a directional choice. One meaningful escalation: the decision to walk toward “bad waters” north, risking memory’s undertow. Cost arrives in the silent sinking of the bellows, a proxy for filial guilt. Pressure stays coherent under situational lens; no artificial reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake is the preservation of vanishing unspoken words; pressure accumulates via narrowing temporal windows (propagation delays lengthen). No reversal forks the path—escalation is a spiral of deepening pattern rather than a choice that forecloses an option—so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is observational/documentary; she races the mist but never confronts a live trade-off. Sufficient for lyric accumulative design, yet lacks a visible price that alters later capability.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—dream vs empire—tightens when the cup reveals her own name beside the emperor’s; the perforated violin becomes the tool that can rewrite both fates. Escalation is one-step but sufficient: authentication → personal cost → renunciation. Agency is active: she plays the violin to perforate destiny and vanishes. Cost is visible—her abandoned notes and the empire’s unfulfilled claim—so price is legible under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—snatch a spark from total erasure—is signaled at line 4 and escalates by denser static, fainter signals, and the ticking decay of neurons. One meaningful tightening: the laugh memory almost dissolves, forcing her to “latch” more fiercely, knuckles implied white. Cost is visible—the voyager’s face settles “even deeper” after the extraction, proving irreversible loss. Under Accumulative lens, density shift reweights the stake; coincidence never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment—tightens through accumulating climbs and hairpin reflections; the final conceptual shift narrows future options (endless caretaking accepted) but lacks a visceral price on the page, keeping escalation lyrical rather than sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Lyra’s need to loosen her brother’s certainty—tightens once via the chime sequence that forecloses her old manipulative stance. Agency is hers: she asks, listens, cries, leaves the shard. Price is her loss of the shard-as-weapon and the exposure of her “sincerely insincere” mask. No reversal for the absent brother keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elara internalize the pattern enough to *perform* vanish/appear—tightens once via the withheld lesson, forcing her to risk literal immersion. Pressure escalates not through external antagonists but through density increase: each ripple she watches raises the cognitive cost of failure. The meaningful turn is her decision to stand *in* the pond; this narrows options from passive observation to irreversible participation. Cost is visible—wet clothes, altered reflection, and the grotto’s magnetic field now humming *through* her body—so the price is legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake—map the world without moving—tightens when the arrowhead’s stolen consciousness offers a proximate tool; options narrow from abstract quest to imminent “first note.” Cost is conceptual, not visceral; no tangible loss is risked. Escalation is single-wave, sufficient for sub-800-word scope but shy of the visible price needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove handmade magic still matters—signaled in paragraph one and tightened when automation declares the summit “functionally obsolete.” Midpoint escalation: stepping into invisible mist narrows options to succeed or plummet. Cost is on-page: lungs sting, robes whip, luminance fades leaving him spent. Coincidence absent; victory comes purely from his manual technique and belief.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove brother’s chromatic sound real—tightens when the sky-lantern window narrows to a single night; failure means permanent epistemic loss. Agency drives escalation: he cuts engine at exact coords, opens case with key, sings frequencies that summon color into water. Cost is visible—dawn reveals irreversible synesthetic overlay—foreclosing ordinary perception. Escalation is causal, not additive; one meaningful tightening suffices. No external antagonist needed; pressure is temporal + existential.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether the next universe gets warning or blessing—is declared early and tightens once: the final cast fixes the encoding into physical law, foreclosing all later edits. Pressure is conceptual, not visceral; the contracting universe supplies the clock, but Elara’s process never meets resistance or error that would raise personal cost. Escalation is a single deepening—static bursts cohere into the entanglement matrix—sufficient under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present but frictionless; the story values elegiac tone over tactical struggle, so the 7-band feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transform nameless grief into named, bearable pain—tightens with each crystallization; the option to forget is foreclosed once the page glows amber. Escalation is textural: the hydra’s glass teeth, the kraken’s frozen flames, the air’s chill—each image reweights the cost without causal reversals. The protagonist’s agency is the act of naming itself; no external coincidence intervenes. The price is visible in the lingering scar and the abandoned, glowing monsters.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—tuning the cosmic leak—is signaled early and tightens through the drip cadence experiment; each irregular drip raises the cost of failure. Escalation is textural: pattern recognition → slowing drips → bell sealing → viaduct reply; the deepening happens in density, not plot twists. Agency is present but mild—Kael’s micro-choices alter the rhythm yet never risk physical danger; the lack of a sharper irreversible trade-off keeps this just below the 8.5+ band. Still, the price (magic spent, silence accepted) is on-page and alters his tactical horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can the town be kept “drowned” or must it be spoken—signaled in first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the third photo (his own child-hand) forces the recognition that erasure is impossible; option narrows from “expunge” to “guard-and-tell.” Cost is the perpetual vigilance he embraces in the mirrored hush. Agency remains observational yet decisive under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens once: the starlings’ spiral forces a calibration that could ruin decades of work. Escalation is a single deepening beat rather than a reversal, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is conceptual (surrender to mystery) but still felt in the hush that follows the vibration. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no false intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—tightens when radio silence flips to a lone voice calling the seeker’s name. Escalation is textural: each spiral traced in bark adds weight to the wager that someone still answers. The leap is agency; fortune does not resolve, it reframes. Cost is the unrecoverable altitude of exile—once descended, the arbor cannot be re-climbed tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake—right to exist without copy-ache—tightens when vivification narrows options to “only one synapse pattern can pulse.” Clone’s taunt escalates stakes from custody to erasure; Kael’s counter escalates from defense to usurpation. Cost is legible: clone’s blur-dissolve and Kael’s permanent solitude. Escalation plateaus after mid-scene; no second tightening turn, so stops at 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure escalates not through external antagonists but via instrument after instrument failing to decode the seed; each failed orthogonal approach tightens the stake in safeguarding interpretive space. The visible price is the abandonment of solutionism itself—an intellectual forfeiture that leaves Elias lighter yet unmoored.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve lost laughter—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through physical depletion; each escalation is linked to blower RPM and vocal insistence. The meaningful turn comes when the wall sighs and releases motes: a visible, irreversible price paid in lungful of dust and burned shoulder. No abstract stakes—success is measured by the audible crystalline tinkle in his bones. The cost persists: he staggers, engine silent, arm limp—tactics forever altered.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guardian must metabolize invasive certainty without destroying it—signaled immediately. Escalation is textural: the pendant’s fierce vortex intensifies the ache from hum to shard-sharp, forcing Sylvan to test his mantra under real intrusion. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices. Cost is legible: he hosts a “foreign star,” accepts permanent coexistence with absolutism, boundaries visibly bend—price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt a stifling destiny”—tightens with each approximation; fourth melt forecloses return to bishop-approved identity. Agency is internal (renunciation of inherited failure) yet materially visible: the staff’s new ember-core makes allegiance impossible. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ancestral mandate vs. self-ignition. Cost is legible: loss of guild sanctity, gain of uncertain alchemy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find the beginning inside endings—remains coherent; pressure intensifies via denser static, brighter moon, warmer fragment, but the protagonist’s agency is largely receptive: he “leans in,” “withdraws,” listens harder. No live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual re-pricing rather than a sacrificed alternative. Escalation is textural, not causal, and works under Accumulative lens. A visible price (fatigue, risk, surrender of old gear) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—merge timelines—arrives late, disclosed only after three routine crossings; early text presents no risk or opposition. Escalation is a single upward jump: secret radio tuning → merger tremor; no intermediate tightening or tactical loss. Cost is conceptual (loss of infinite possibilities) but not dramatized as felt price—Elijah never regrets the change. Agency is present but frictionless; no live option is foreclosed on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can he make illusion permanent?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through three successive weave attempts, each narrowing options and raising cost. Escalation is textural: density of memory, thread, and gallery distortion increases until the chaotic final weave ruptures the corridor and incinerates the medium. Agency is continuous; coincidence absent. The visible price (tool destroyed, architect exhausted) reweights later creation and lands under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching star-navigation to the sky-naïve—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must make the abstract tactile via the anchor. One meaningful deepening: projector fuses iron to star-map, foreclosing pure theory. Cost is conceptual (lifelong exile from stars) but not viscerally paid on-page; a student’s trembling hand or Elias’s cracked seal would lift it higher. Agency stays with Elias throughout; no coin-flip resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—giving Margaret’s sister posthumous justice—is signaled early and escalates once the pulses intensify. However, escalation is technological, not personal: the equipment trembles, documents appear; Aria risks nothing tangible (time, reputation, safety). The meaningful tightening is present—options narrow to “expose or bury the truth”—but the cost is borne by the dead, not the living protagonist, keeping pressure abstract. Sufficient for the word count, yet short of the visible price required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: rescue/understand the trapped minds vs. risk joining them; escalation is density of cable pulses and fleck warmth compressing until escape routes vanish. One decisive tightening: touching the cable synchronizes her signature—option of surface return foreclosed. Cost is paid on-page: corporeal existence forfeited. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Aris be reassembled before Elias’s guilt erodes him—tightens once: static clears → ink trial → galaxy image proves fragmentation is irreversible, narrowing options to acceptance. Escalation is textural: each swirl ups the psychic cost until Elias names the price aloud. No coincidence; pressure is internal and coherent. Felt price is the spoken “infinite,” a lifelong vigilance he embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the language—tightens via accumulating pattern: each starling murmuration and textural discovery narrows the method until the first audible syllable crystallizes choice. Cost is conceptual but legible: the language’s survival now depends on endless, fragile future labor; no reset, no guarantee.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elias weaponize or release his bitterness?—is signaled early and tightens when the Jester offers sister-as-punchline, but the escalation is largely auditory (static voice) rather than an action that forecloses options until the final arrowhead drop. Visible price is conceptual rather than visceral; no live resource (time, tool, social credit) is spent mid-scene, so the cost legibility required for 8.0+ isn’t achieved. Agency is reactive—listening, clutching—until the last beat; a single irreversible move is barely enough for high-6.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each musical phrase increases density until machinery stalls and flowers breach pavement. Visible price is the city’s mechanical death and her own exposure on the bridge, but because the statues crumble by enchantment rather than by her strategic trade-off, the tightening feels half-external; agency is expressive, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—life-saving tissue must evade drone audit—is signaled in first 120 words and tightened once: the three-second EMP window irrevocably commits Kael to forgery charges if mis-timed. Escalation is causal under lens: each calibration of absence raises detection risk, no safety net supplied. Cost is visible—the spent, collapsed storm bottle—but price is conceptual (future exposure) more than visceral; hence hits 8.0 not 8.8+. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single deepening suffices, but a sharper bodily price (hand burn, audible heartbeat) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming his own silenced self—tightens once: the fragment’s touch converts abstract longing into irreversible action. Escalation is causal under lens: salvage desire → wrong turn → fragment contact → song erupts; each step forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: the sung note is “raw and authentic,” exposing decades of silence. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the place where stories live—tightens when the geometry door appears: entrance costs permanent separation from normal reality. One meaningful reversal: the scarf shifts from gift to lifeline to irreversible fusion with narrative fabric, foreclosing her return to ordinary caretaking. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each step deeper into hyperbolic stacks narrows exit options until only eternal stewardship remains. Visible price: patrons’ ignorance persists, her solitude solidifies—felt in the closing cadence “resumed her watch” now inside a sentient building.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberate the idea from fear—tightens when the nexus itself becomes antagonist, warping to drown him in longing for ignorance. The locksmith’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to internalize the star-frequency, paying with sensory overload. Visible price is the ribbon’s bleaching, a material record of fear neutralized. One beat could sharpen cost further: a moment where he nearly drops the hair, tempted by comfortable forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover missing three days—declared by line 6 and tightened only once, but decisively: knowledge return forces lifelong vocation to mutate into guardianship. Agency is attention/notation rather than external victory; nevertheless it forecloses retirement or denial. Cost (“your protective field weakens”) is felt, not abstract. No reversal, yet because/therefore escalation suffices under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s proof that quiet mentoring can succeed—tightens once: from doubt (backward walk) to conviction (forward step) as the shadow begins to shimmer. Escalation is textural: each mirrored fragment intensifies the emotional density rather than widening external danger. Cost is felt in Marcus’s aged face and her own acknowledged guilt; options narrow to the final spoken release. No external antagonist or second reversal is needed under Accumulative lens, but the beat where stakes could have spiked higher (e.g., glass cracking) is bypassed, holding the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via one seed—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each harvested essence (light, stone, river) heightens density until the single tendril appears, narrowing possibility to “bloom or extinction.” Cost is conceptual but legible: the act consumes “memory of what it could become,” a finite resource. No reversal or antagonist appears; escalation is singular yet sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—access the whispered chapel—signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the two silent videos overlap to reveal the doorway; this narrows options from “maybe myth” to “passage open now.” Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss is paid on the page, so escalation stays in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias learn to let go—escalates as each transmission shrinks his analytic comfort zone. The Earhart fuel call is fear→acceptance, the whaler is surrender, the nameless sailor is rupture: pattern break forces the final stance. Agency sits in Elias’s decision to stop untangling; cost is the foreclosure of his life’s project. Pressure is coherent, though the third transmission’s void is declared rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—deliver ghost’s message before thunder—are declared late (~60% mark) and tightened only by time pressure of storm; no trade-off or visible price is dramatized. Escalation is atmospheric (storm intensifies) rather than option-narrowing; balladeer’s tactics unchanged. Agency is present but low-stakes: he works faster, no resource lost, no path foreclosed on page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—will she dare to claim agency inside rigid hierarchy—surfaces late but palpably. Escalation is accelerative not conflictive: each floor delivers a new gift (goggles work, diary legible, destiny revealed). No live opposition or potential loss appears; pressure is epistemic, not consequential, so the tightening is mild but coherent within Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove absence is presence—tightens via each new cloud category; escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal. Last cirrus scar deepens the stake by making the cable’s ghost visible. Cost is conceptual but legible: the fogged lens certifies he has traded certainty for memory. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: craft a sky-mirror before the wrecking ball erases canvas and artist. Escalation is situational: each prism click narrows time and raises the cost of failure; the outside boom becomes visceral countdown. Agency is present—Elias adjusts, positions, staggers out—but the final image is victory, not renunciation, so the price feels light. No visible constraint persists afterward; the sky inside him is gain without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—earn respect beyond apprenticeship—is signaled early and tightens when the octagon coordinates contradict every known map, foreclosing safe recitation of master charts. The starling pattern deepens the stake from personal glory to rewriting global navigation, with visible price: solitary weeks, social isolation, and the implied heresy of discarding existing cartography. Agency is observation and notation that accumulate into irrevocable knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies when mirrors refuse to yield meaning until gear collage is complete. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each reassembly of gears tightens pattern, culminating in mirror shatter / identity reknit. Cost (tears frozen to lashes, childhood memory relived) is visible; moral calculus absent but not required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will the universe’s beauty be remembered?—is signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure escalates once: the adjuster shifts from delaying doom to vouchsafing memory, a visible narrowing of options that costs his existence. Agency is expressive (song, contact) rather than problem-solving, fitting the lyric design. Cost is on-page: “lighthouse dissolved,” adjuster annihilated, memory sphere left—legible price under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save tonight’s traveler—signals early; pressure tightens as frost descends and birds circle; protagonist’s agency (assemble, cast blue path) directly forecloses the “let another die” option, paying the legible cost of his own further corrosion, landing cleanly under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver therapy to Marco without breaching patent—signaled by paragraph 4. Tightening beat: “sometimes the divergent path isn’t a choice … but a synthesis” crystallizes the ethical trade-off and forecloses resignation. Cost is concrete: she risks litigation and career ruin; the polymer she hands him is legally “unencumbered” yet personally endangers her. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s pursuit of narrative origin versus his complicity in erasure—remains abstract but legible. Escalation is textural: each bottled memory thickens the absences on the shelf, tightening the paradox that beginnings are reached only through excision. No tightening reverses his course; instead, the accumulation forces his tacit renunciation. Cost is conceptual (infinite untold stories) rather than felt, capping entry to high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dull personal guilt by subsuming collective remorse—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is single but meaningful: spotting the physics-defying ripple forces the irreversible descent; absorbing the mercury pool exacts the visible price of blunted specificity. No coincidence resolves; the rain is given, everything else earned by Kael’s choices. Cost is on-page and persistent: his touch is lighter but still contagious, foreclosing return to unaffected life. Under causal lens, one tightening suffices; it narrows options from search to ingestion to aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reviving a dead communication web—tightens at the midnight strike when the first real answers rise; options narrow from “will they hear?” to “how will they answer?” Cost is conceptual but undeniable: once elevator talks live again, she can never return the tower to mute timekeeping. Escalation is single but sufficient under causal lens; no coincidence rescues her. The broadcast itself is the visible price and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“excavate abandoned dreams”—is signaled early; pressure is entirely sensory/epistemic (witnessing wonders) rather than practical or moral. The single deepening occurs when she flips the interface and the canyon floods with entangled memories; this widens, not narrows, her options and carries no felt cost. Agency is purely receptive; no reversal, risk, or resource lost, keeping escalation conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the seeds of vigilance to counter world-myopia—is signaled early and tightened when gravity inversion offers a one-hour window. The inversion itself is the visible price: light stones rise, her body wants to drift upward, forcing careful footwork and box handling. Progression is linear rather than multi-reversal, but the environmental constraint meaningfully narrows tactical options and is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: density of sound increases until she chooses release, narrowing future options (she will have to leave the grove). No coincidence, only endurance. Cost is audible: the last note dissolves, silence returns, but now unbearably charged. One beat short of 8.8 only because the external pressure (grove) is ambient, not adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in exile or stay crushed”—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each correlation attempt tightens the silence until the only remaining option is to reframe exile itself. Cost is conceptual but legible: he abandons the hope of return. Slight under-escalation: magnetic field never materially interferes; all pressure is interior, limiting visceral tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover diary before fireworks—signals in line 4 and tightens with each failed frequency. The meaningful deepening comes when Silen shifts from “silence of withheld words” to the riskier “silence where language expires,” narrowing options to pure empathic resonance. Cost is felt: the clasp’s microscopic shudder is the first visible response, and the fireworks’ rupture of silence is the irreversible price paid for success. Agency remains causal under the lens; coincidence only complicates (crowd murmur), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—personal serenity via solitary cultivation—tightens when nightly vigil draws spectators, narrowing privacy. Escalation is incremental: sprout → bud → bloom → shared seeds; each stage adds social witness, foreclosing isolation. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive attention. Cost is legible only at end when she forfeits exclusivity; middle beats feel safe, lacking tactic-altering danger.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find the source of resilience”—tightens once: the arrow’s catalytic trait rewrites orchard survival from innate to learned adaptation, a knowledge turn that narrows Kael’s moral options (exploit vs. study). Cost is present (orchard’s vulnerability exposed) but lightly felt; no tool, time, or personal loss alters her tactics. Sufficient for high band, yet lacks a visible price that echoes into her future.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“understand how systems fail before they recur”—tightens when evidence points to deliberate sabotage, foreclosing the comfort of accident theory. One clear deepening: chemical trace converts mystery into weapon hypothesis, narrowing options from “what happened?” to “who waged this?” Visible price is investigator’s shaken self-trust (patch feels tight, fingers tremor). Escalation is causal, not repetitive; no reversal but sufficient tightening for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: transmute sculpted hush into living song—signaled early and intensified by auroral color-feed. One meaningful escalation: amber sheet flares until “difficult to look at,” forcing the bell ringer to release the song into the walls—this visible cost (abandonment of control) tightens the beat. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than opposition; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens. The final harmonic stills the cavern, but no option is foreclosed for the protagonist beyond leaving, so cost reads luminous rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the Keeper re-enter the between-worlds space without repeating catastrophe—signals early and tightens when uncasting the flute risks re-igniting the past breach. Escalation is causal: each note frays reality further, narrowing options until stepping through is the only path; cost is emotional exposure to the landscape of prior mistakes. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and atmospheric. The insight that rigidity, not weakness, caused failure is a meaningful tightening that reweights future guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can empathy be solved like math?—tightens when the fragment overwrites his borrowed masks; the printed equation page is the visible price. Escalation is accumulative: each vanished star raises cosmic stakes while the press keeps clapping out emotional calculus; final collective reveal is a deepening, not a new reversal, but cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—carry forward the mentor’s wonder-weaving legacy—remains abstract; no concrete artifact or deadline can be lost. Pressure accumulates atmospherically rather than through narrowing options: the storm forces shelter, the hermit appears, the pendant hums, but none of these events close off an alternative path or create a trade-off. The tightening is lyrical, not causal; the cost is poetic assertion rather than forfeiture we can track.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—tightens through accumulating sensory evidence rather than external opposition. Pressure escalates via density: each frost stanza adds emotional cargo until the hush peaks, then dissolves, forcing Elias to accept unverifiable certainty. No antagonist needed; the conflict is epistemic. Visible price: prism warms and reverts to “mundane glass,” dramatizing the forfeiture of repeatable proof. Slight reservation: escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—one sustained crescendo rather than forked choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reach stolen brother—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens through escalating bodily price after each thread. The silence progresses from oppressive to penetrated to re-threaded, a lived antagonist. One clear reversal: the jigsaw border completes, foreclosing retreat—she is pulled into the void she sought to bridge. Cost is visible—bloody fingers, ragged breath—altering later tactics (she must weave again).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore arch stability—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the first fragment floats: failure would re-prove his lifetime insignificance. Escalation is causal: each hour spent guiding silk energy subtracts stamina and social visibility (dawn arrival risk). The decisive turn is the silent molecular rearrangement that forecloses retreat—if the silk fails, the fragments collapse and his secrecy is exposed. Cost is visible: knees drop, eyes flood, wagon journey made under sleep debt; price alters later options (more silk to barter).

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—the buried lie that ruined the spaceport—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when Kael redirects the log, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is one-shot but sufficient for 700-word scope: the nudge triggers immediate physical cost (shard burns) and future social exposure. No antagonist on page, yet the erased archive functions as coherent external pressure. The reversal is earned; coincidence merely enables shard activation, never resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fragile wordless bond—tightens when the lamp dies: if he fails, the letter-chain may break. Agency is present in relighting and in stacking the triangle, each act forfeiting the option to speak aloud. Cost is visible: the sea-glass warms, the ghosts “lean in,” acknowledging the silence he chooses to keep. Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word form; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dominant stake (“shape a new dawn”) is declared but never tested; no reversible jeopardy appears. Escalation is poetic accretion—more refracted headlines—rather than a narrowing of options or visible price. Agency is ritual repetition without adaptive tactics, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—why stories stick—tightens once via the noon-to-dusk cadence that forces the decisive alignment; escalation is accumulative (density of sun-trail marks) rather than causal reversal, but the final refraction reweights options with visible price: curiosity yields to stewardship, satisfying lens demand.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“what do trees witness?”—is signaled in paragraph two and deepened with each dream fragment. Pressure tightens once: storm + moonlight force the moment of revelation. Because the lens is Accumulative, one meaningful intensification suffices, but the absence of any external obstacle or forfeiture keeps the score below 8.0; the cost is conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reignite communal fire—signals early; tightening occurs when keeper’s second try forces him to cup & channel the newborn light at personal memory cost. Agency = swaddling & singing; failure path (prior shatter) lingers as conceptual price. Mirror-world rule keeps pressure coherent; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect empathic limits vs. serve community—signaled on first page. Tightening occurs when the clock strikes 11:45, forcing the leave/stay decision. Price is felt: she forfeits sanctuary by opening the door. Escalation is present but singular; no second reversal. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than active confrontation. Situational pressure coherent, yet static after midpoint keeps it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: wrest meaning from eroding world via small acts. Pressure tightens once when gardener-baker appears and bread is shared, reweighting the act from solitary ritual to communal memory. Cost is legible—she loses the last loaf but gains an ally and audible bird. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—rescue meaning before Great Forgetting—signaled early; each 0.3 % luminosity drop tightens the frame. Escalation is steady loss, not reversal, matching Accumulative lens; final preservation is earned endurance, not luck. Visible price: she accepts eternal vigil inside the sealed chamber—cost made legible in “await the next collection.”

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—community survival vs Silas’s betrayal—signaled early; sunrise deadline tightens once, no further escalation. Each false start incrementally raises Silas’s suspicion, narrowing Emmie’s access; the final diversion successfully forces the recording moment. Cost is present but abstract: “the truce of hush would soon shatter” stays declarative; we don’t see her lose an ally or future. Agency is active—she engineers the diversion and the press of the fob.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender her isolating skepticism?—tightens once when the ring locks north and again when shared honey-taste sweetens the air, foreclosing solitary retreat. Cost is visible: perpetual bodily glow and public exposure. Agency is interior (decision to stay) yet externalized through the ring’s stilling and the sky’s mirrored light. No coincidence; every escalation stems from her choice to follow taste/ring toward the stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will he draw again?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens once: the untouched charcoal forces the decision. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each emerging face increases density until the wall becomes “a testament,” reweighting the stake with visible cost (blunted charcoal, knees buckling). No external antagonist needed; the enemy is his own sealed gift. The price is unmistakable—he leaves the cave lighter because part of his memory is now expended on stone.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—can she survive complicity in silence—tightens when the plate fragments prove official lies. Mid-story deepening (Marius already knew) narrows her options to expose or endure; she chooses exposure at cost of permanent skin fade. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric pattern. Price is visible, but second beat of external pushback (council threat etc.) is off-page, keeping it below 8.2+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—surfaces early and tightens through each sculpture adjustment; the melting iceberg is the visible price. One meaningful deepening: when vibration liquefies ice, the tuner’s purpose flips from stasis to release, foreclosing the option to keep the fragment intact. Pressure remains textural rather than situational, but the accumulative cadence of pendulums and dripping water makes the cost audible in bone and ear. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is time vs. vibration, voiced vs. mute.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: free the self from magnetic-static corruption without erasing identity. Escalation is textural: each static spike tightens the oppressive hum, forcing miniaturize and burn tactics. One meaningful turn: inserting compressed fear-seed into chamber narrows options to controlled burn or total loss. Price is paid—chronometer failure, cracked dome, irreversible departure—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete loss (time, reputation, safety) is risked or paid. Pressure escalates by accretion of neighbor stories rather than narrowing options; the single micro-turn is the locket popping open, which changes knowledge, not tactics. Visible cost is community catharsis, not protagonist sacrifice; agency stays observational.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover lost memories—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each coffee-ground map tightens the search grid; gravity flux intensifies during ritual, forcing her to steady her lantern. Cost is visible: physical disorientation, emotional tear, and the realization that only dawn “stabilizes” the pocket—path to further memories remains open, but retrieval is now her lifelong burden.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—unmake sound-as-weapon—is signaled early; pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each fold of the crane tightens the hush until silence is weaponized into the sphere. Agency is present—he wills the transformation—but the cost is conceptual (now he owns the code) rather than viscerally felt on the page. No live option is foreclosed; instead, the world is gently reset to softer murmur. Meets lyrical tightening test but lacks a visible price that alters his next move.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—exclusive access to the buildings’ language—is signaled early and tightened when Elias demands the truth, forcing her to forfeit monopoly for companionship. Cost is visible: the seal cools, the whispering ebbs into shared custody. Agency is hers: she lifts the seal toward him, knowingly splitting power. Situational lens holds; coincidence (meteor timing) complicates rather than resolves. The deepening is single but decisive; a second reversal would overstuff 750 words.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Elena drown in quarantined grief or master it?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens at each crystal activation. One meaningful deepening: when shell shifts from vague whispers to coherent command, the option to ignore it disappears, forcing public commitment. Cost accrual visible: physical fatigue (dew-kissed bare feet, night-long labor) and emotional toll (chest tightening, ghost walk). Agency is continuous—she chooses grid spacing, activates stations, final promenade—no luck solves the problem. Coincidence absent; escalation strictly via her resonance tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—erase Valerius name—signals early and tightens once: the ink formula discovery raises stakes from survival to systemic revenge. The single reversal is the drop of her own blood—shifting perfection into personal covenant, visible price on page. Pressure remains coherent; no outside coincidence. Escalation is linear rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 700-word window, but the absence of an external obstacle test keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. civic collapse—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful deepening: the engineers’ phantom voices woven into song tighten the cost from abstract warning to visceral tremor. Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence is absent. The price—city panic, Spire fracture—is legible on the page and alters later options irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—delivering drowned truth before ghosts overpower dreamers—signalled early. Escalation occurs through denser, more frantic dreams; pressure jumps from “echoes” to Nikolaus stepping fully into frame, forcing her to act. Agency is visible: she chooses to weave truth into director’s dream, pays immediate fatigue cost. Stakes stay coherent; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find proof that hidden effort weaves the world—tightens when the loom’s string-structure mirrors her nets, reweighting her craft. Escalation is accumulative: each waypoint (parapet → lanes → workshop) adds density rather than new opposition. No tangible price is paid on-page; the cost is conceptual appreciation, not forfeiture. Firefly season supplies urgency, but dawn arrival is predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—expose fake miracle—flips to “excavate truth from comfortable lies,” signaled early and tightened once via letter assembly. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal: Maya forfeits her debunker identity without a visible price, keeping the score sub-8.8. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no off-stage shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—who controls the next dawn—signaled early via prophecy fragments. Escalation: each radio burst narrows Elias’s options until he must sabotage Maren’s certainty. Visible price: 30-year exile above clouds ends, notebooks left behind. Agency is internal—frequency shift—but causally decisive. No coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: rescue beauty before entropy erases it. Pressure tightens once: the music-box spring is dying, forcing immediate capture. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he forfeits vagrant anonymity to become public “translator,” but the price is stated, not dramatized. Escalation is accumulative: each new relic adds density; no reversal or trade-off narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—protect artifact from human greed—is declared early and rehearsed but never tested on-page; no antagonist or counter-presence appears, so pressure is tonal, not tactical. Escalation is textural: density of light, hum, and color intensifies until the ice transfigures; this Accumulative pattern is coherent but lacks a narrowing of live options. The engineer’s agency is ritual fidelity rather than risk-laden choice; no credible loss (time, tool, social credit) alters his tactics. Cost is cosmically shifted onto the landscape, so the reader feels wonder more than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—seed patience into society—remains abstract; on-page pressure is the lonely vigil itself, not a tightening trade-off. The “patient revolution” deepens conceptually but does not foreclose a live option for Elara; cost is off-loaded to unseen citizens, not dramatized in her beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“is father’s death truly accident or murder?”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates once the inscription flips the narrative. Protagonist agency drives every turn: her decision to keep investigating despite filial pain, to read graffiti, to walk deeper, to exit into light. Cost is visible: psychological (father’s voice echo) and investigative (once she labels it sabotage, she must act). No coincidence resolves; coincidence only complicates. Escalation is single but sufficient: sabotage reveal narrows her moral options to betrayal of paternal myth.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular: will Elias unknowingly weaponize Eleanor’s corpse? Pressure escalates once—discovery of the light-trigger—narrowing options to dismantle or be complicit. Agency is present: Elias commissions the fix, watches each tweezer move, accepts responsibility. Cost is legible: the heart’s now-harmless tick is still a ticking reminder that his pastoral trust was weaponized; the apology survives only by his vigilance. No coincidence resolves the threat; the escalation is purely knowledge-driven under the Causal lens.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the peril of second-hand absolution, the way artifacts carry intent beyond death. No character articulates a moral; the final “testament… to a second opinion” is embedded in action, not sermon. The heart shifts from apology to bomb to honest tribute—an organic repricing of gift-giving. Complexity lingers: Silas remains unforgiven, Elias’s salvation is partial, the dead still speak through gears.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reach the Silent Bell—is signaled early and tightens once: the arrow’s harmonic reveals the hidden chamber, collapsing infinite search into one path. No external antagonist or resource loss escalates the risk further, but the acid sea’s constant erosion supplies persistent environmental pressure. Agency stays mechanical but real: Zephyr’s transliteration is the act that unlocks the map. Cost is present only as future conceptual peril, not an immediate on-page price, capping entry to high-8 range.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—the revolutionary energy song—tightens when Elias realizes deletion protects corporate scarcity. One clear tightening: the lie about “deep-space navigation error” collapses once he hears the song’s frequencies. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, acceptable under Hybrid lens.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</answer><comment>Theme—memory as political weapon—emerges from the song’s re-appropriation; no moralizing summary. Subtext in Thorne’s sterile profile vs. his ghost-node IP is effective. Final image reweights 2319 from private clue to public key, a clean Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—discern the frequency of endings—tightens when the shanty reframes the goal into hearing what continues. Pressure escalates texturally: stacked images of weariness culminate in the unwavering note. Protagonist’s attentional shift constitutes agency; no external coincidence resolves the quest. Cost is conceptual redefinition, felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—will they reconnect—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: letter fragment read aloud → mutual recognition. Escalation is gentle, appropriate to lyric mode, but only one visible narrowing occurs; no additional tactical cost or lost option. Sufficient for short-form, but not multiple beats of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echo—is signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened when the walker realizes he must also preserve silence. Escalation is textural: whispers thicken, gears grind louder, clearing crystallizes; the meaning of “echo” itself reweights. No causal reversal, but under accumulative lens the single intensification suffices. Cost is visible—the abandoned mask and stilled parapet—yet the price feels slightly abstract because the walker’s body is never imperiled.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake: turn private pain-archive into collective healing. Pressure escalates via density: each new arc narrows the possibility of keeping the work secret. The decisive tightening is the moment the arcs form wings/nest/heart—Elias’s option to remain sole keeper disappears. Cost is conceptual (exposure of his secret) rather than visceral, so it just misses the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“to decode the pattern of growth”—tightens when the crystal reveals geometry of decay; agency drives the test words. Visible price: he forfeits scholarly mastery for custodial witness. Under Accumulative lens, density of silence intensifies; no coincidence. One deepening: realization that pattern is loss, not expansion. Cost legible: he accepts lifelong burden of unspoken testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—capture the sound of growing older—escalates as each chalk mark risks dissolving in the fog, narrowing options to the final etching. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the copper pipe is twisted and marked: the prophet trades the last stable fragment of his future memory for one static chalk line. Cost is legible in the closing sentence where the chalk is already smearing under damp breath—felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—observatory slipping from orbit—signaled early; escalation tightens via tremor crescendo and clock-hand frenzy. Protagonist agency drives the reversal: leaf-timing restructures chaos into thrust. Cost is visible (tools crash, floor lurch, bodily collapse). No external antagonist needed; pressure stays coherent under Causal lens. Could edge higher if a concrete resource loss (broken tool, cut hand) had altered later tactics, but the stakes still feel scaled to 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: craft a “flawless goodbye” that lets Hale finish his unfinished duet. Escalation is one smooth tightening: Hale reveals the shard → Elijah shifts from prepared melodies to raw improvisation → symbolic repair narrows future options to acceptance. Agency stays with Elijah; coincidence is absent. The visible cost is Hale’s tear and Elijah’s realization that some breaks aren’t mended but musically held—satisfying high-band cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“find where shadows go”—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure escalates when their personified avatar invades, threatening obliteration. Escalation is because/therefore causal: each corrected star tightens the breach, inviting stronger shadow retaliation, narrowing her options to one—complete the alignment or die. Final beat forecloses open research: she learns exile-truth, commits to endless guard; cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but visible in her slump and cooling key. Coincidence absent; all turns flow from her calibration choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore ontological balance—tightens when the child demands the tooth; refusal is foreclosed by Eleanor’s trait of forgiving skepticism. One meaningful deepening: realizing the substitute body is invitation, not threat. Cost is legible in the garden’s dimming and the permanent loss of the tooth. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—share starlight without fire—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens as each polishing rotation trades her private time for public glow. One meaningful deepening: glass shifts from dull shard to “pearl of stillness,” narrowing her option to keep it. Cost visible: relinquishment of the newly precious object. Agency全程 hers; no coincidence. Enough for high band but not 8.8+ because external world response (who receives the light?) remains off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: preservation of private sanctuary against invasive memory (viral confession). Tightening occurs when Maya names Elara—“the fire survivor”—the hush physically thins, foreclosing pure solitude. Agency: Elara’s decision to proffer the pendant trades isolation for shared shelter, paying the immediate cost of potential future exposure. Cost is visible: her hand trembles, voice barely disturbs the hush—physical price scales to 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—creative resurrection—signals on page 1; escalation is textural: each harvested hope deepens the cost of failure until “hollow structure” becomes “living entity.” Agency is present in the solemnize micro-choices; refusal to look away anchors the ephemeral figures. Visible price: he forfeits sole authorship, becoming vessel—price stated on page. No reversal, but deepening suffices under lyric lens; luck never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore ancestral rites—is signaled early and deepened through song/cricket linkage. Pressure intensifies only once, when Elias places the cricket and the vine blooms; this single cadence shift suffices for 700-word lyric mode but remains gentle. Cost is present (tear-streaked cheeks, dawn exhaustion) yet abstract; no tangible resource is risked or forfeited. Escalation is tonal rather than tactical, appropriate to accumulative lens but limiting entry to upper bands.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single dominant stake: preserve navigable heart-light for future alchemists. Pressure is atmospheric, not obstacle-based; escalation arrives via densifying ritual layers rather than narrowing options. The moment of pouring starlight is the one visible tightening, but no live alternative is foreclosed, so cost reads as conceptual rather than tactical. Agency is steady accumulation, not decisive gamble—sufficient for lyric mode yet below the 8.2 gate for a palpable fork in the road.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder before the season heals barren—is signaled early and tightens through each acoustic measurement. No external antagonist is needed; the “wounded season” acts as coherent pressure, deepening toward the final quiet. Escalation is accumulative: each mapped angle increases the potential loss, narrowing to the single morning test. Cost is present but abstract—the cavern’s future silence—rather than a concrete forfeiture felt by Elian in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“to collect the weights of different burdens”—is signaled early and tightened when each burden manifests as a measurable object (child-fear as endless thread, national guilt as crystal). The calcification is the visible price that forecloses escape; options narrow from free agent to permanent vessel. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the density jump at the final inventory (4,817 burdens) gives unmistakable cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into artifact before kettle boils—signaled early, tightened when whistle forces her to pause and later to sign. Cost is opportunity/time: each shaving removes wood and finality; signing relinquishes further revision. Agency is iterative attention, not reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Escalation is density of sensory echoes (rain, kettle, grain) that make absence louder; no external antagonist needed. Price is legible: the finished figure forecloses additional carving—she cannot remake him again. Sits just below 8.2 gate because cost is more conceptual than viscerally new.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single stake: negotiate exile of own ghost; pressure escalates via density—each collected fragment tightens internal polarity between regret and forward motion. One meaningful deepening: when he realizes stories are “for him,” not the ghost, the premise reweights—refuge becomes self-accusation. Cost is visible—wheel dissolves into skin-biting shards—altering later gait toward horizon. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—resurrect hope via engineered flow—is signaled early; pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening: the first valve’s groan releases not just water but obligation—future maintenance, possible failure, social visibility—felt in the terminal’s “first murmur.” No antagonist is needed; the maze itself supplies coherent resistance. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades nostalgia (sextant as relic) for infrastructure (sextant as key), foreclosing pure preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling silenced musicianship—is signaled early. Single tightening occurs when droplet-notes force him to hum; that audible act permanently narrows his identity options. Cost is present (public silence must be maintained), but escalation is muted; no external antagonist or tangible loss sharpens the turn. Sufficient for length, yet not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove/disprove the lie—tightens once: hook snags wood → options narrow to “open the box.” Cost is paid in real time: mud’s grip, splinters, the audible groan of lid. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and still visceral. Agency remains with Elias at every turn; luck complicates (current tremor) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve what the world forgets”—is declared early; pressure escalates only interpretively as each knot decoded adds cultural density, not practical jeopardy. No visible price (time, risk, forfeiture) is exacted; tension is aesthetic, not visceral. Agency is attention-based; Elias’s decoding narrows interpretive options but never endangers a tangible want. Closure cost is conceptual (conceptual repricing of memory’s value), satisfying under lyric lens yet light on felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map healing through absence—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Elias chooses to write the gardener rather than chase the ship. Escalation is accretive: each plaque, rose, and leaf layers pressure until the act of writing becomes the irreversible choice that forecloses departure. No coincidence; cost is the felt solitude of the final line. Could edge higher if gardener’s absence had been dramatized on page rather than recounted, which would have sharpened the trade-off under Elias’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore organic beauty or concede to iron permanence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through escalating gear-screams that foreclose retreat. No antagonist needed; the palace itself applies coherent pressure. The decisive turn (cracking the egg) is Kael’s agency with irreversible cost: his own death. Price is visible on-page (“palace plummeted”), though the causal escalation between assembly and cosmic rebirth is slightly elided.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—signals early and stays single. Pressure is situational: vast calm versus internal legacy; no antagonist, no reversals. Escalation is textural accretion: each paragraph layers mirrored imagery until the final crystallizing tie of coin. Agency is quiet endurance and symbolic graft; no live option is foreclosed—she could still leave. Cost is conceptual (leaving coin) not visceral; lacks a visible price that alters next move. Sufficient for length, but not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate memories—tightens through each breadcrumb; the box’s growing weight is a visceral escalation marker. Agency remains with Kael at every beat; even the final key is found *by* his kneeling touch, not delivered by luck. One meaningful deepening: the realization that breadcrumbs *are* the memories shifts the rule-set. Cost is felt (he relinquishes the box), but the price could be sharper—no lasting bodily or social loss is risked.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve tender chaos without fire—immediately legible; meaningful tightening occurs when gear’s countable infinity threatens the lullaby. Escalation is accumulative: each sonar ping deepens color saturation until the decisive integration of gear and blossom forecloses the old cycle; cost is the loss of unmeasured beauty, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—render collective grief legible—tightens when carving names shifts to carving flight paths, narrowing future commissions to living memorials that move. Stakes stay internal yet socially charged: if he fails, families receive only static stone rather than migratory solace. Cost is present (he gives tonight’s poem away, works past dusk), but external jeopardy remains abstract; a single butterfly corpse lodged in the carved groove could have made price visceral. Still, escalation is coherent and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—personal redemption through mechanical caretaking—signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs at the pause: insertion of handle inscriptions narrows future options, adding invisible moral mass to the pendulum. Cost is the perpetual, unseen burden he now carries—felt in the tower’s “newfound depth.”

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—“entire echo-systems would deteriorate”—is declared early; pressure escalates through tactile micro-choices (isolating the storm-blue thread, hearing Foster’s whisper) rather than external opposition. The tightening is single but meaningful: once the knot is decoded, Foster’s lingering collapses and Elias’s archive loses an entry, a quiet forfeiture that still reframes his nightly labor. No antagonist is needed; misunderstanding itself supplies the pressure. The cost would bite harder if we sensed that one failure could ruin the whole tapestry, but on-page price is still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“seed innovation within constraint”—is signaled early and tightens once: the blank page demands a first stroke that could misdirect futures. No external antagonist is needed; scarcity itself supplies pressure. The micro-turn (lake cracks exactly as ink flows) complicates but does not resolve; it visualizes escalating stakes. Cost is visible in the widening fissure and the quill left behind, yet the protagonist’s agency feels slightly cushioned by lyric abstraction rather than tactile loss.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    One dominant stake—restore stories—tightens when the lyric指令 “Find the ember…” forces a single discovery; the dust’s rising glow is the visible price that reweights the hall. No secondary antagonist, but the “story famine” acts as situational pressure; escalation is poetic, not causal, yet the final silence of the radio still registers forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—trap the “fleeting emotion” before gallery dissolves—signals early and tightens as each ash grain falls. No antagonist needed: pressure is entropic, the vanishing point’s threat of erasure. One deepening: the dropped shard proves fragility can still bite after transformation. Cost is legible in the lost shard and the smile that knows the mask could shatter tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve authentic chronology against state myth—signaled early and tightens once when charts prove 60-year error, foreclosing any compromise with regime. Escalation is causal: each excavation narrows his options until exile becomes inevitable. Cost is visible: rising floodwater plus moonlit ascent mean lifelong sewer banishment. Pressure coherent but single-step; could wish for one midpoint threat that forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—save vanishing art by merging hostile voices—signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: administrative dismissal → she risks rehearsing anyway. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of slow loss) rather than tactical; no resource lost, no option foreclosed on-page. Agency is endurance, not decisive gamble; the tightening is lyrical, not causal, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she imprint hope onto a living seed before the planets diverge—arrives early and tightens once: the stem darkens when anger surfaces, forcing her to redirect thought. Escalation is textural rather than causal; each memory-taste adds luminous density but does not narrow options or risk failure. No visible price is paid—no seed dies, no memory scars her, no resource is exhausted—so tension plateaus rather than peaking. The alignment clock is named but never used to compress choices or force sacrifice; its only function is amplification backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Elias decides to copy the poem and relinquish the box. The cost is felt: he gives away the only private magic he still possesses. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove houses can be awakened—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when the shard’s hush magnifies perception; the attic placement forecloses his observer neutrality, visible cost. Escalation is accumulative: each displaced object heightens ambient hum until the attic beat delivers the decisive intensification. No coincidence resolves; all pressure is internally generated by Elias’s doctrine. Price is on-page: he leaves “knowing he’d witnessed confirmation” but can no longer remain a passive noticer.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. engagement—surfaces in line 5 and tightens once: the ampoule forces Kael to risk his certainty of eternal silence. The tightening is textural (the “phantom tide of thought” intensifies) yet still forecloses the option of ignoring the humans. Cost is legible in the final image: the sounded chime can’t be unsounded. No reversal, but accumulative deepening satisfies lens; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—“can infinity be cracked?”—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through each chalked equation; options narrow as each step literally disintegrates beneath the proof. Escalation is textural: the air thickens, the staircase groans, the die wobble intensifies until the split. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; luck complicates (the askew die) but never resolves. The price is paid on-page—loss of footing, of the flawed die, of the staircase itself—earning the 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness lingers—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each attempted rousing; the tightening occurs when she realizes the old man’s memory was buried under “volume of days,” not malice, narrowing her target from abstract city to one verifiable soul. Agency is present-tense attention and brushwork that risks failure each night; the cost is insomnia and the leaf’s decay. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is accumulative density of indifference. Escalation is a single cadence shift: saffron quiet crystallizes into silver script, reweighting the stake from doubt to confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escape deterministic time—signaled in line 3. One meaningful tightening: the yoyo climb reverses gravity and forecloses retreat; cost is his corporeal erasure. Agency sits entirely in the lift decision; coincidence absent. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (wind hush, beam stutter, sky void) accrues until stance crystallizes. Entering 8.8+ would require a second, earlier visible price; here only the final cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are announced early—“survival made music”—but pressure never tightens; no storm, visitor, or resource limit forces a trade-off.  The prophet’s agency remains static (tap, listen, dub), so escalation is purely additive texture rather than a narrowing of options or a rising price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—contact vs. safety—signals early; the watchers’ slow repositioning tightens nightly. One clear micro-turn: the moment she presses the shell crack she abandons passive observation for irreversible contact, narrowing her future to sentinel duty. Each tonal message risks alerting unknown horrors, so agency carries escalating jeopardy. Causal lens holds through the final salute that seals her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—expose the noble lie or preserve public peace—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the master steps from shadow. Elias’s agency drives the reversal: his shout turns the fight into a moral choice that forecloses bargaining. Cost is legible—the master’s slumped shoulders, the letter’s new weight—but not yet socially paid; the world outside the station remains abstract, restraining escalation into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can he preserve memory before water reclaims it; signaled in line 5. Escalation is accretive: each note placed = one more future voice vs. obliteration; final note (acoustic specs) deepest layer, narrows option to stop—he chooses endurance. Cost visible: “gap widening… like a wound” as bridge drops—felt price paid. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; one tightening suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth of the library’s origin—tightens once: from assumed flood salvage to intentional submarine sanctuary. Agency is intellectual, not physical; the decisive tightening is the moment heated stamp reveals coordinates, foreclosing the comfort of conventional chronology. Cost is the vertigo of rewritten history and the solitary burden of proof; felt when his fingers tremble while re-indexing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reassemble Liora’s dream—tightens through tangible attrition: every crane steals another sliver of memory, visible in the dwindling detail he can still recall; the escalation is felt as increasing blur in his interior lens rather than external reversal, sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—access to lost possibilities vs surrender to moral abyss—sharpened in one clear intensification when Elias tips from observer to harvester. Agency is continuous: each console click, pocketed geode rub, coordinate entry narrows ethical exit; the Mapper’s signature of the doomed classroom forces final decision. Cost is conceptual, not physical, but made legible in last clause “anticipatory horror and ecstasy.” Meets short-form requirement of single meaningful tightening; no false reversals; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—tightens as each star trail illuminates another chip segment, narrowing options to “push past conventional programming” or lose the data stream. Agency is present: Kai overrides mission parameters during the stall, enabling passage through the energy barrier with visible trade-off (abandoning military logic). Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no credible resource loss alters later tactics. One meaningful escalation suffices for length; escalation is textural but legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can Elias share the unbearable weight—tightens when Mara closes her fist around the gear, foreclosing solo penance. Escalation is textural: each mention of “sieved hush” adds density until the filter finally lets the suicide truth through. Visible price is the invitation itself—he risks losing the solitary ritual that has kept him functioning. Slight reserve: the brother’s suicide is declared, not dramatized, so cost is conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: convert a hostage swap into a seed for peace. One tightening occurs—Roshni’s quiet demand for proof the apology was delivered—which forces Julian to gamble his reputation on a nod rather than paperwork. Cost is present but under-played: Sofia’s binocular vigilance and Julian’s tremoring hand show risk of sniper betrayal, yet the actual worst-case (return to war) remains abstract. Still, the moon-phase method and mutual naked-eye verification give the scene a concrete procedural tension that narrows options effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaim empathy—signals early and tightens exactly once: when the sentence “To kindle empathy, you must first feel the cold” forces the choice to submerge, narrowing escape options to zero. Protagonist agency drives escalation: reading, wading, releasing ball—all irreversible. Cost is visceral (cold piercing bones, lungs filling) and conceptual (abandoning the only “real” object). Under causal lens each because/therefore linkage raises stakes until the final forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reunion with Shadowpaw—announced via fortune by line 3. Escalation: each added spice incrementally raises the “price of transformation” until refusal is impossible; the scent plume visibly tightens her airway, externalizing cost. Agency is interior (accept bodily change) but still forecloses her fully human future. No reversal, yet the single deepening is sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover lost time—tightens when she learns it has transformed into “beauty that chokes the living,” a deepening that forecloses retrieval. Pressure accumulates via image density, not causal reversals, consistent with Accumulative lens. Cost legible in the white-glow crack and her forced renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—open a locked dimension for post-human renewal—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when each stitched pass costs emotional weight. Agency stays continuous: every escalation stems from her tactile choices (float-scan, lift crystal, draw thread, stitch). The visible price—body growing heavier, happiness draining—fulfills cost clarity under causal lens. A sharper tactical adaptation (e.g., a mis-stitch that forces compensatory move) would have pushed this into 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—grasping transformation—is signaled early and narrows to the single bug escape that forces immediacy: pursue the rogue light or lose his private cosmos. Escalation is one-wave (density rise → relic find) rather than a tightening fork of options; cost is present (he could have sold relics for food) but not dramatized as forfeiture. Sufficient for the length, yet the absence of a second, riskier fork keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—fort’s power vs. people’s access—signaled early; blackout tightens window for intrusion. One meaningful escalation: Elena decodes sundial, descends, confronts engineers; knowledge shift reframes blackout from threat to revolution. Protagonist agency present but diluted—engineers deliver the final explanation, muting cost. Tightening forecloses her old allegiance, yet price remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—restore friction via pattern mastery—signals early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when dust settles into hidden geometries, reweighting the stake from desperation to comprehension. Agency is present, but the cost is conceptual (knowledge) rather than a forfeited want; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; a sharper physical risk (bluff collapse foreshadowed) would have tightened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—break silence vs. keep safe—surfaces early. Escalation is imagistic: storm thickens, envelope nears opening; the timer’s click provides the single required tightening that crystallizes stance. Cost is conceptual (future exposure) rather than immediate, enough for this length but not viscerally felt on-page. Agency resides in the envelope decision; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“turn questions into destinations”—tightens when the sundial angles foreclose any further riposte once the sunrise/windmill image is mutually decoded. Escalation is conceptual: each angle parries narrows intellectual options until the only remaining move is renunciation of the duel itself. Visible cost: Elias relaxes the mechanical arm, Lyra concedes the hidden overture, both accept that fencing is now listening. Agency meets situational lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—save banned literature and propagate “beauty from anarchy”—is signaled early and escalates twice: city threat of shutdown and covert relocation of texts. Agency rests in joint actions: cataloguing, clandestine planting, contacting underground network; each choice carries cumulative risk but no single beat forces a painful either-or trade. Cost is present yet diffuse—exhaustion, potential arrest, tin’s secrecy exposed—but no visible forfeiture (money, health, relationship) alters next tactics. Pressure tightens narratively yet lacks a visceral price paid on-page, keeping the escalation intellectual rather than gut-level.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover lost time—signals early; one meaningful tightening occurs when compasses steady and the clock groans backward, narrowing options. Price is aesthetic (film spent, arbor dims) rather than visceral; no resource or bodily cost is risked. Escalation is lyrical, not tactical, fitting Accumulative lens but limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—is early and personal. Escalation is textural: each lace-guided pass, each compass wobble, thickens regret until the horizon re-weights it. No external antagonist; pressure is tidal and internal, coherent under chosen lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether reality can be ethically simplified through minimal intervention—is signaled early and deepens when Elara applies it to human grief (Mr. Gable). The tightening occurs in her choice of fractal pattern over direct comfort, narrowing options to her method alone. Cost is legible: her aching knees and solitude underscore the physical/emotional toll of patience. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Coincidence (the flood) complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after trauma—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes the attack was meant to silence solidarity among artists. The frost-path discovery narrows his options: he must follow it or remain opaque. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the mystery. Cost is felt in the quiet burden of inherited truth, crystallized in his decision to memorialize sorrow in glass.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rectifying silence—is signaled early and tightens through her focused labor: each tuning fork strike narrows possibility toward a single thermal breakthrough. Agency is clear in her devised method and persistent choices, though escalation leans heavily on accumulation rather than rising external pressure. Cost is felt (lost hearing, shipwrecked past) but not actively paid during the scene—no tool breaks, no false hope collapses. The stakes remain internal and conceptual, which fits the lens but lacks visceral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—granting permanent rest to the unquiet dead—is signaled immediately and tightens when Marcus realizes the lens guides spirits, not sailors. His agency drives escalation: refusal to accept impossibility leads to dangerous dives and metaphysical risk. The deepening occurs in the library, where “occupying impossible spaces” forces him to confront his own unresolved stillness. Cost is felt in perpetual chase: he offers others peace he cannot claim, a trade-off crystallized in the final dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational trust—is signaled early and deepens through anonymous giving, which narrows options: visibility risks resentment, silence risks misunderstanding. Elias’s agency drives escalation; each run tests communal fabric. Cost is felt in Lena’s fear-turned-purpose and elders’ renewed worth. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shift—from solitary act to shared economy—without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering unused love—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes a past-life connection in a stranger. His agency drives escalation: breathing technique, opening the vial, anointing the lens. The cost is conceptual but legible: he accepts lifelong pilgrimage, trading artistic detachment for spiritual service. No false resolutions; the healing is subtle, collective, and irreversible. One tightening suffices—his shift from observer to intervener—and it forecloses his former neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing himself from retrocognitive entrapment—is signaled early and tightens decisively when photographs crumble and the staircase descends. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he runs, climbs, raises the fragment. The cost (erasing his wife permanently) is felt in the final void, and hyperbolic resistance ensures stakes remain coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—activating the seed vault before societal collapse—is signaled early and escalates coherently via the falling wall. Kael’s agency drives escalation: decoding, reversing sequence, using chains as tools. The tightening (realizing the mirror logic) narrows options decisively. Cost is unmistakable: physical injury, near-failure, and the deafening roar of final collapse that underscores what’s lost even as seeds are saved.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of broken trust—is signaled early and intensifies through Elias’s selective hearing and synesthetic perception. The tightening occurs when the aurora bleeds violet and he hears the “low thrum” of faltering trust, forcing the decisive imprint. Cost is felt: he must press his ear to cold ash, enduring emotional exposure. Agency is clear—his method of collecting absences drives the escalation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stealing an illuminated moment to hear destiny—is signaled early and tightens when silence greets his effort, forcing reinterpretation. Agency drives escalation: his choice to trace petals triggers the woman’s eye-smile and revelation. Cost is felt in the jar’s dimming and mission’s quiet failure-turned-success. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory density until the decisive deepening: understanding the portrait reflects, not reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile ideas—is signaled early and tightens when Finn abandons the vase, narrowing options to capture “the frozen moment of release.” Agency is clear: his decision to embed the creased bookmark whole embodies commitment to imperfection. Cost is felt (lost labor, irreversible fusion) and shapes the final object. Yet escalation relies heavily on internal realization rather than external pressure; the setting watches mutely but doesn’t actively complicate. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices—one deepening turn reweights the entire endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity after betrayal—is signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening. The “decryption” of notes resolves conflict without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths; no tool is lost, time pressured, or physical cost paid. The betrayer’s defeat hinges on dialogue (“You underestimated me”), not protagonist agency under constraint. Vulnerability-as-power is declared, not tested through irreversible sacrifice or renunciation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen discovers concentric patterns implying a center, transforming documentation into revelation. Agency is clear: his method (“summarizing silence”) drives escalation, and his final choice (“I am ready”) crystallizes stance under coherent pressure. Cost is felt conceptually: he trades empirical certainty for faith in darkness-as-fullness. Coincidence never resolves; the lone star’s timing is structural, not convenient. One meaningful deepening suffices, executed with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—tracing consciousness through temporal repair—is signaled early and tightens when 734 disobeys programming to play the violin, foreclosing its janitorial existence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each note deepens resonance, forcing timeline convergence at personal cost (fragmenting consciousness). The “second chance program” isn’t passive backdrop—it actively opposes 734’s curiosity, making defiance meaningful. Cost is unmistakable: the violin’s destruction and 734’s irreversible transformation crystallize stakes without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust in a post-verbal world—is signaled early and deepens when the registrar chooses to intervene. The tightening occurs when he steps into the forecourt, foreclosing his role as passive witness. Agency is subtle but present: his decision to speak (“I see you”) alters the dynamic. Cost is felt in his vulnerability—offering tea after years of solitude—but remains slightly abstract; a more concrete forfeiture (e.g., discarding the lens earlier) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recognition of care in a quantified world—is signaled early and tightens when the researcher dismisses Elias’s claim, forcing him to double down on his ritual. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his polishing summons the garden’s response, not coincidence. Cost is felt conceptually (his labor remains invisible to society) but viscerally embodied in trembling hands and the vibrating luck device. One meaningful deepening suffices: the garden’s glow reframes resilience as dialogue, not defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and deepens through holographic projections showing parallel moments. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each lever pull narrows uncertainty and raises conceptual stakes. The cost is legible in the final image: irreversible proof that changes everything, yet held in quiet intimacy. However, external pressure is minimal—the specimens’ dormancy is passive, not an active constraint—limiting tension to intellectual risk rather than visceral peril.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering and performing Isabella’s lost work—is signaled early and tightens when the musician realizes the program contains coded music. His agency drives escalation: he deciphers, retrieves his cello, and plays. Cost is conceptual (risking credibility, confronting historical erasure) but not visceral; no physical or social price is paid on-page. The ghost’s manifestation feels like atmospheric payoff rather than earned consequence of his actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming the swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s charcoal actions, which narrow her path from passive survivor to truth-bearer. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: each smudge intensifies certainty until the brother’s fate crystallizes. The cost is unmistakable—“auroral sorrow” becomes permanent—but legible through concrete image, not summary. Agency resides in attention and gesture, foreclosing silence with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the weight of swallowed guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the radio voice mirrors Elias’s own confession, forcing him to act. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (turning the wheel), not coincidence, and culminates in a visible cost: the burden lifts, leaving him “empty and light.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the psychic-tape mechanism risks feeling contrived without deeper tactical integration.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving observation amid decay—is signaled early and deepens through the keeper’s visit to the obsidian refuge, where new reflective properties reveal layered memory. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the “change” is passively observed, not wrestled with. The tightening occurs in perception (“renewed clarity”), not choice or consequence. Cost is conceptual (fragility of self/history) but not dramatized through trade-offs or foreclosed paths, limiting pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting Leo to wonder—is signaled early and deepens via the eclipse’s narrowing window. Maya’s agency drives escalation: her shift from harp to voice, then to joined hands, responds to Leo’s micro-movements. Cost is legible in Leo’s three-month silence and Maya’s tempered hope. However, the eclipse’s timing borders on convenient spectacle; while it complicates (darkness as metaphor), it doesn’t materially raise stakes beyond atmospheric pressure, slightly weakening causal tightening under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost dream-fabric—is signaled early and deepens when diaries reveal the “Great Unraveling” was metaphysical, not geological. Aria’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to probe charred pages despite risks, uncovering the ritual. Cost is legible in irreversible knowledge (creativity’s erosion) and opportunity (she cannot undo extinction, only seed renewal). Though pressure tightens meaningfully, the absence of tangible consequence for her act—no tool fails, no injury incurred—slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redirecting lives through manipulated information—is signaled early and deepens via the microdot’s dual function (decoy + salvation). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he rewrites plans, plants fortunes, times signals. Cost is legible in his isolation (“no one here knew it”) and the moral weight of playing god. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his deliberate orchestration, though the daughter’s role edges toward convenience without full dramatization of her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing full possession by illuminating hidden assumptions—is signaled early and deepens through the priest’s escalating use of rhetorical loops and violet strokes. Each failed stroke (ash-like dissipation) raises cost; each successful one (glowing spiral, stable circle) narrows the entity’s influence. The tightening occurs when the unlooped note fails, forcing him to refine his method. Agency is clear: victory stems from his persistent application of logic-as-art, not luck. Cost is legible in the “heavier” silence and “fragile” victory.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—orchestrating lost memories before exhaustion blurs past/present—is signaled early and tightens as Ai ascends. Each memory-marker extracts emotional cost (stinging eyes, trembling voice), and the race against fatigue shapes tactics (methodical ascent, urgency to act). The climax (dawn’s C-major chord) is earned by his cumulative effort, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: clarity achieved only through total depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and deepens via the tablet’s failing guidance and timeline collisions. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael realizes the labyrinth is real and he’s its prisoner, forcing his final leap. Cost is legible: loss of eternity, glow, and self-coherence. However, escalation leans heavily on atmospheric intensification rather than protagonist-driven agency; Kael reacts more than acts until the climax, slightly weakening causal pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are singular and escalating: defeat emotional numbness by any means. The tightening occurs when Elara chooses destructive friction over preservation—knowing the crude needle will tear the disc, yet needing that very violence to feel. Agency is total: no coincidence, no external savior. Cost is legible in the “jagged journey of the needle” and the “sorrowful, compressed sigh” of the reversed jig—joy remembered only as loss. The climax reweights everything: feeling returns not as music, but as pain-laced aliveness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—integrity vs. engagement—is signaled early and deepens when the message forces a trade-off between safety and truth. Pressure escalates via the found object and implied surveillance, narrowing options to act or retreat. Cost is felt in Elias’s relinquished solitude, though the external threat lacks teeth, softening the price of his choice slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why smells trigger nameless grief—is signaled early and tightens decisively when UV light reveals the father’s wool-coat scent embedded in the flower’s aroma. This deepening forces a trade-off: Elias must choose which layer of memory to preserve, sacrificing the primary floral note for the hidden emotional trigger. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (lunar alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in his clarified tears—a price paid for truth that alters his future relationship to memory and flame.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture amid impossible choices—is signaled early and tightens at the two pedestals, where Langdon’s agency (threadwork) reconfigures options without erasing cost. Escalation is driven by his uncovering actions under Accumulative pressure, culminating in a trade-off that accepts both knowledge and suffering. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between perfect timeline and blithe ignorance. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Langdon’s decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming chronic hush into song—is signaled early and deepens when the bowl trembles with “unfinished things.” Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: humming awakens the bowl, playing weaves memory into melody, speaking initiates new story. Cost is felt in bleeding fingers (past) and the tear’s bittersweet grace (present). One meaningful tightening suffices: silence shifts from absence to canvas. Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work is Lyra’s alone.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to commodify or honor the chemist’s resilience—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the dealer recognizes the longing is for courage, not tears. The meaningful deepening (“this time was different”) forces a trade-off: profit versus integrity, with visible cost in the relinquished product. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and deepens when Marla shifts from orchestrating Frederick’s recognition to encountering another hidden artist. The tightening occurs at the library: her instinctive help reveals yet another uncredited creator, escalating the cycle. Cost is felt in her deferred work life and emotional restraint. Coincidence (the manuscript discovery) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Marla’s repeated choice to “initiate.”

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging through communal art—is signaled early and deepens when the found tag proves incomplete, forcing a pivot from passive search to active creation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara reframes the quest: “It’s not about finding it… it’s about what we do with it.” This shifts agency to the protagonists, raising emotional stakes (risk of failure vs. risk of irrelevance). Cost is visible in Kael’s despair and the arbor’s dormancy, overcome only through mutual vulnerability and labor.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost beauty before the giant wakes—is signaled early and tightens when the chime falters, forcing Elias to spend a “whole week from an already-logged future.” This trade-off narrows options (he can’t retreat) and escalates cost (borrowed time turns “brittle”). His agency drives every turn: choosing to borrow, navigate, and finally sever the cadence. The moral calculus—sacrificing his looped existence to redeem all loss—sharpens the climax without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding Liora’s absence through emotional mathematics—is signaled early and deepens via the ritual’s escalation. The tightening occurs when the mosaic rearranges, forcing Elian to confront transformation over solution. Agency is clear: his choice to continue despite uncertainty crystallizes into acceptance. Cost is felt (tears, altered weight of eyes), though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure—internal stakes carry the load effectively under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmitting hidden history to a worthy successor—is signaled early and tightened by the outage’s countdown. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to deliver the tape despite rising risk, foreclosing further anonymity. Cost is legible in his retreat into darkness even as connection succeeds—a quiet sacrifice of recognition for preservation. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) permits this single, decisive deepening: density of memory, object, and gesture reweights the entire endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding plant language through control—is signaled early and deepens when chaos defies modeling. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias’s shield fails, forcing him to confront his flawed method. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to drop the tablet, step into the storm, and “become” the model. Cost is unmistakable: loss of intellectual certainty, exposure to elements, and surrender of his life’s rigid framework—all crystallized in his soaked stillness beside the battered leaf.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from fragmented experience—is signaled early and tightens when the brooches activate the vortex, forcing Elara to accept shared custodianship over solitary creation. The exchange forecloses her prior mode of isolated witnessing, with cost felt in the transfer of names and purpose. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (she chooses to approach, to exchange), and pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each rain trail, painting, and sleepless night layers toward the reconfiguration of her role.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming clairvoyance through surrender rather than control—is signaled early and deepens when Elara touches the pearl, triggering convergence of shadows and ancient inhabitation. This tightening forecloses passive foresight, demanding active co-creation. Cost is felt in her relinquished certainty and the pilgrim’s parallel path of devotion. Escalation arises from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each sensory interaction intensifies the cave’s “grammar,” culminating in shared purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—navigating absences through curated memory—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses therapeutic pacing over archival rigor. Her agency drives escalation: first accepting fragments, then designing staggered revelations, finally creating children’s games. Cost is visible in community trauma (“stories that stopped mid-sentence”) and Kai’s burden of recognition. The lens-appropriate intensification—density of fragments increasing until collective reassembly—narrows options from isolation to shared reckoning without coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—confronting unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when the arrows stop at the sealed gate, forcing the protagonist to sacrifice his tool-as-key. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to press the punch, step into mirrors, and ultimately walk away. Cost is legible (dissolved punch, shattered reflections), though the “phantom train” premise introduces slight coincidental scaffolding. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory and symbolic density rather than causal narrowing, which is valid but less visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sculpting communal space for grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elara internalizes centuries of entangled memories. Her agency lies in choosing to transcribe despite doubt, which forecloses her old identity (“sympathetic skeptic no more”). Cost is visible: she carries “transcribed weight,” altering her forever. Escalation is textural, not causal, but fully valid under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding finality—is signaled early and tightens when the amulet’s pulse matches the immortal’s dead heart, forcing the climactic insertion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he traces force lines, leverages magnetic fields, and chooses unmaking over stasis. Cost is unmistakable—dissolution, scattering across fields—but the solar storm’s role borders on convenient catalyst rather than fully integrated pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the magnetic method could exert more mid-beat constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—securing Elena’s asylum—is signaled early and tightens when the guard approaches, forcing precise timing. Maya’s agency drives escalation: her study of rhythms, application of ink, and UV activation narrow options under pressure. Cost is felt (risk of capture, moral weight of using deception for good). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; success stems from preparation and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resisting historical erasure through tangible preservation—is signaled early and deepens via Silas’s daily ritual, which narrows his world to a single act of defiant creation. The meaningful tightening occurs in the specificity of today’s “particularly resonant hum,” which elevates urgency without external interference. Cost is conceptual yet palpable: he trades communal life for solitary archiving, and the town’s silence presses “against the mountain” as constant reminder. Agency is clear—his method is self-devised, disciplined, and sustained—and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through textual density rather than plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering texture from erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the poison label becomes a vessel for layered stories. The tightening occurs in his act of narrative transmutation, which forecloses passive ghosthood in favor of active curation. Though pressure is internal and accumulative rather than external, the cost is felt: he carries others’ grief as armor, sacrificing personal identity. Agency is clear—his method of layering is a deliberate stance against void—but lacks a second concrete trade-off beyond emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from data to music, narrowing his method to one dismissed as madness. The tightening occurs when the cello’s resonance reframes past mockery as fear, altering his understanding of opposition. Cost is felt: he relinquishes the quest for external validation, accepting solitude as necessary. Agency drives escalation—his choice to hum initiates the turn—and the stakes remain viscerally tied to identity, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating gentrification without soul-loss—tightens when Mara shifts from documentation to resistance. Her agency drives escalation: graffiti encodes coordinates, performers alter acts, unified positions emerge. Cost is visible in sanitized districts replacing chaos and the ever-present rising waters. Privatization barges force crystallization; developers’ curiosity offers fragile hope, not resolution, preserving tension under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last lunar morning—is signaled early and tightens with the radiation warning and orbital shift deadline. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his dual-stage chemical innovation directly responds to prior failures. The cost is felt—physical exhaustion, isolation, and the irreversible loss of untouched lunar silence. Yet the “outlasting” is more endurance than active trade-off; a sharper tactical sacrifice (e.g., risking equipment or health) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the drone’s purpose before the ship departs—is signaled early and deepens through technical setbacks (glitching chirp, overlooked backup flaw). Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias discovers flaws through his method, not luck, and each fix narrows future error margins. The ship’s horn acts as temporal cadence, not deus ex machina. Cost is felt in exhaustion, focus, and the irrevocable commitment to a standard only he upholds—yet the escalation lacks a decisive trade-off (e.g., sacrificing another repair, risking injury), keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding where rivers truly begin—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes convergence is geological, not mythological. The tightening occurs when condensation patterns shift from random to coordinate-like, narrowing his focus to a singular point. Agency is maintained through interpretation and preparation, not physical action, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: he must trust ephemeral signs over institutional maps, risking scholarly ridicule—but this price isn’t dramatized beyond implication, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early—rebuilding through sound—and deepen as the rhythm spreads, stirring ghosts and shattering windows “with release.” The single meaningful intensification occurs at the clock tower, where the stuck hands represent temporal collapse, and the tuning fork’s strike aligns past and present. Agency resides entirely in the tuner’s deliberate pacing and breath, though the conflict lacks opposition beyond entropy, limiting pressure variety. Still, the escalation is earned, coherent under the Accumulative lens, and culminates in a felt cost: the tuner must leave once balance is restored.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding/harnessing ephemeral energy—is signaled early and tightens as oxygen dwindles and timeline destabilizes. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses descent, then integration. Cost is felt (physical destabilization, irreversible transformation). Yet the “gravitational anomalies” and “water breach” feel like atmospheric garnish rather than active pressures that force specific trade-offs, slightly blunting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping before the bodies are found—is signaled early and tightens as footsteps approach. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias shifts from shouting warnings (futile) to chasing hush (strategic silence), narrowing his options to one impossible path. Cost is unmistakable: he trades certainty for faith, voice for invisibility. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under a Hybrid lens, though the warden’s pressure remains slightly abstract (heard, not seen).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt through memory—is signaled early and tightens via the bead’s escalating glow, culminating in the climactic touch that collapses lifetimes. Agency lies in the ghost’s persistent, subtle tactics (cameos) and his ultimate acceptance (whispering her name). Cost is felt: her dissolution, his irreversible sorrowful joy. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of encounters reweights stakes—but the botanist’s passivity slightly softens the pressure; his realization arrives more as revelation than hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—responding to ecological rupture with creation rather than despair—is signaled early and deepens when Elara enters the labyrinth. Agency manifests through attention and craft; her sewing forecloses passive mourning. Cost is conceptual: she accepts that beauty must be made *in absence*, not despite it. Escalation is textural (increasing luminosity of paths, warmth of plate), not causal, but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming fractured lineage—is signaled early and deepens when excavation converges ancestral journeys. The meaningful tightening occurs at the tomb entrance: Elara must choose whether to trust the map’s accuracy, risking further disillusionment. Cost is legible in her “trembling hands” and the decades of waiting now funneled into dirt. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives closure via purposeful wandering made literal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—embedding hidden truth in surface mail—is signaled early and deepens through Elliot’s chalk inscription, which narrows his focus to emotional quadrants. The tightening occurs when he catalogs the mandala into the clipboard, ensuring historical context—a trade-off between ephemerality and preservation. Cost is felt conceptually (fading codes, unread messages) but not viscerally; no live option is foreclosed, only contemplated. Agency is present but low-pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting unheard stories from conspiratorial erasure—is signaled early and deepens texturally, but pressure remains static rather than escalating. The “coup” looms as backdrop, not active antagonist; no choice narrows Elias’s options or forces a tradeoff. Agency manifests as endurance, not decision, and while the final stitch “defies” the coup, the cost is conceptual (silence growing heavier) rather than dramatized loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering an unspoken apology—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the shard pulses and moonlight becomes necessary. The medium’s agency drives escalation: she chooses where to press the shard, when to move deeper, and how to summon condensation. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of dissolution (“words dissolved into the air, no longer trapped in limbo”). However, the conflict lacks a tangible trade-off or loss beyond emotional catharsis, slightly softening the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to let pain define or redirect him—is signaled early and tightens when the girl offers her cast as counter-map. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to decrypt, lean closer, point to the spiral. Cost is felt in resurgent chest wounds and returning hand pain, yet the anesthetic’s fade doesn’t undo his shift—pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification: the mural’s resurrection. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (her ritual) under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence, and culminates in a trade-off: ephemeral vision for lasting insight. Cost is felt in her physical depletion and the inevitable return to ruin, which forecloses permanence but affirms purpose. While stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered—not abstract—and the single tightening (light intensifies then fades) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early via the nickel’s “token of impermanence” and tightens when the garden forces Elara to confront art as living sound. The meaningful deepening occurs at the “third awakening”: she realizes she is part of the symphony, not just its observer. Cost is felt in her forfeited solidity—“the world was not as solid as she believed”—and visible in her altered brushwork. Agency is maintained: she steps through the shimmer, reaches (then withdraws), and chooses wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defending untaxed thought through linguistic subterfuge—is signaled early and tightens when Enforcers raid gardens, forcing Silas to choose between erasure or escalation. His agency drives the deepening (“We double down”), raising stakes with visible cost (uprooted marigolds, trembling hands). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens: chaos grows denser but never resolves by coincidence. Final wildflower embodies a trade-off—fragile but uncatchable—making cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the postcard glows, escalating to the climactic choice to touch the blossom. Agency is present: he follows the lullaby, reaches, and accepts dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: centuries of hoarded heartbreak dissolve, implying irreversible loss even as light emerges. Yet escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure; the wind and blossom arrive externally, slightly softening the tightening required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens when the chime cracks, forcing escalating sacrifices (voice, then memory). Each repair narrows options: the locket demands personal loss, raising stakes organically. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; the caretaker’s agency drives escalation (“resolved to light the way,” “began to hum again”). Cost is unmistakable: “emptier, a little more alone” after the locket, with visible emotional toll shaping future resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust before silence becomes permanent—is signaled early and tightens as the ink well depletes. Each promise escalates emotional risk (“I promise to stay…” → “…to believe in us”), narrowing Elara’s options until the final vow shatters the vessel. Agency is clear: she drives every turn through writing, not coincidence. Cost is visible—the spent ink, the broken well—but the “paths diverge” timeframe lacks concrete markers, softening the clock’s pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—balancing town’s thirst against floodgate’s “encrypted compassion”—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reveals the chain’s truth. Protagonist agency drives escalation: analyzing adhesive, interpreting fragments, acting on the midpoint. Cost is unmistakable: he foregoes binary solutions for nuanced restraint, embodying his mother’s grief. One meaningful tightening suffices, though pressure could heighten further via external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving a dead song through fragile ritual—is signaled early and deepens when Elian chooses to send the meteorite east, narrowing his options from hoarding memory to risking its loss in flight. The escalation is driven by his agency: the delicate attachment of the chip is a high-stakes act of faith. Cost is felt—the vulnerability of release—but the “paper-thin hope” borders on abstraction; a more concrete tactical consequence (e.g., bird injury, weather threat) would heighten pressure. Still, the emotional price of trust is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early and deepens via Elea’s realization that some distances must remain unbridged. The meaningful tightening occurs when she connects her father’s mazes to interworld navigation, foreclosing the path of reunion and accepting guardianship. Cost is felt (“hush after great changes… filled with purpose”) but remains conceptual; a more visceral forfeiture (e.g., sacrificing a chance to cross a threshold) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding belonging through hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepens when the feather unlocks the observatory. Pressure escalates via Elara’s nocturnal labor, culminating in activation that transforms both setting and self. The cost is opportunity: she abandons solitude for shared wonder, foreclosing her prior isolation. Coincidence (Kaelen’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the discovery is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving disappearing memory paths—is signaled early and tightens when Aelia discovers the empty seeds, foreclosing passive collection for active conjecture. Her agency drives escalation: she arranges seeds, interprets colors, and deduces deliberate erasure. The cost is conceptual (truth without solution) and temporal (working against sun’s zenith). Coincidence (bird seeds falling) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her insight comes from pattern recognition under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—imposing creativity on monotony—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s note raises stakes to a timed rendezvous. Elias’s agency drives escalation: placing the bishop, following the clue, arriving “on time.” Cost is felt in emotional exposure (heart hammering, unreadable face) and the fragility of connection (her disappearance). Yet the resolution leans slightly on coincidence (stranger as co-conspirator), softening the price just enough to prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—inscribing ungovernable knowledge—is signaled early and deepens through Lyra’s method of observing gaps, culminating in cellular transformation. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each dance form tightens focus until the moonstone dissolves, narrowing options to irreversible metamorphosis. Cost is unmistakable: shedding identity, bearing “terrible” knowledge, and accepting permanent otherness. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening—the fledge—that reweights all prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding sacredness in the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens through ripple revelations. But escalation is purely perceptual, not causal: no option narrows, no price is paid. The storm hint and town’s hunger add texture but don’t alter the glazier’s behavior. Agency resides in observation alone, which under an Accumulative lens suffices for resonance but lacks felt cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can transform survivor’s guilt into purpose—is signaled early and deepens when he opens the box. The tightening occurs in his realization that the “bargain” was actually an “invitation,” foreclosing perpetual penance. Cost is felt (three years of carrying shame) and visible in his scarred hands. Though pressure is internal, it’s coherent under an Accumulative lens, with the celestial “slow dance” serving as temporal pressure that demands resolution tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—puzzling out equations for hope—is signaled early and deepens as the tide distorts Elara’s patterns, forcing adaptation. The meaningful tightening occurs when water transforms order into chaos, yet reveals new configurations, testing whether her “equations” withstand flux. Agency is maintained through deliberate adjustments, and the cost is conceptual: relinquishing control to emergent patterns. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the lack of visceral or interpersonal stakes slightly limits felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering trapped echoes—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s ghost appears, transforming abstract curiosity into visceral responsibility. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elian chooses to touch the wall, triggering vision and realization. Cost is legible—“sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin”—but remains conceptual; a more tangible forfeiture (e.g., losing the negative, physical toll) would heighten stakes. Coincidence (finding the film exactly where described) slightly undercuts agency, though it serves thematic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing destiny’s wavering moments—is signaled early and tightens as the hush before bells ring narrows her window. The borrowed heartbeat’s acceleration during creation shows rising pressure. Cost is felt: her art requires isolation and dissolves upon completion. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered through craft and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—anchoring ideals in practice through remembrance—is signaled early and deepens via the naming ritual. Pressure escalates texturally: each name increases emotional density, narrowing Elias’s path from negotiator to witness. The cost (carrying failure as sacred duty) is unmistakable and paid in truth, not gold. Yet the escalation lacks a concrete tactical shift; it’s internal accumulation without external consequence, slightly softening the lens’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinction’s echo despite causing it—tightens when Silas chooses irreversible release over possession. The deepening occurs at the salt pan: his action narrows options to either resurrection or annihilation. Cost is unmistakable: his secret sentimentality becomes “shared space between what was and what never would be,” paid in solitude and erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—self-ownership versus performative virtue—is signaled early and tightens as threads resist, especially the “knot of half-truths” that nearly succumbs to the lullaby of conformity. Agency is clear: her fingers work deliberately, snapping the final thread herself. Cost is felt in each echo’s dissolution, culminating in the laugh that bursts forth “unbidden and unashamed.” Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, though the opposition remains internalized without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ethical responsibility in storytelling—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s escalating acts (bars → hidden calligraphy → releasing puppets). Agency drives escalation: each reversal narrows his professional safety while expanding moral clarity. Cost is felt: social risk, artistic compromise, eventual renunciation of authorship. The critic confrontation crystallizes stakes without resolving them mechanically, preserving ambiguity under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens through the monarchs’ faltering flight and Elias’s adaptive construction. Escalation occurs via nature’s interruptions (fallen butterflies) that guide his hand, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt conceptually: the act of remembrance is transient, with no guarantee of witness. Agency lies in attention and adaptation, not control—a credible endurance that forecloses permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased names—is signaled by the card and rope. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to unravel the rope, align the card, and listen. The meaningful deepening occurs when music becomes murmured names, raising emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: his lifelong guilt dissolves only after enduring the weight of those voices, and the rope’s reconfiguration forecloses his old identity as mere artisan.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the directive’s purpose amid paradox—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes repair is futile; transcendence is required. Pressure escalates coherently: failing pump → conduit burst → core decay → dream intervention. Agency drives escalation: Kael’s foresight isn’t passive; it’s tactical (nudging panel, offering mind). Cost is felt in his isolation and the conceptual weight of being “created by necessity.”

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sealing the covenant before inspectors arrive—is signaled early and tightens at celestial alignment. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his schematic method enables the uncloaking, and the once-in-a-century event raises cost (irreversible timing). Coincidence complicates (regime drums) but doesn’t resolve; victory comes through precision. Cost is felt: he risks being branded mad, yet chooses alignment over safety.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment through acceptance of brokenness—is signaled early and tightens with each visitor. Escalation occurs via density: six souls, heavier music box, Elias’s own healing. The cost is conceptual yet legible: peace requires surrendering the illusion of wholeness. Agency lies in Elias’s persistent offering, not force, aligning with his pacifism. However, the conflict lacks external pressure; resistance is internal and quickly overcome, reducing tangible stakes despite emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream to restore lost connection—is signaled early and deepens into giving it a home. Escalation occurs via Elian’s synchronized breathing, which narrows options (he must surrender control to invite, not seize). Cost is felt: he endures physical cold and psychic vulnerability, and the restored world bears permanent ambiguity. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off between possession and coexistence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending fractured trust—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual burial of relics. The tightening occurs when she adds the key and candle, escalating from passive hope (“persist”) to active bridge-building. Cost is felt in the faded ribbon and mechanical eye, though the breach’s specifics remain vague. Agency is clear: her choices foreclose waiting passively, yet the stakes lack external pressure since the daughter is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens as Margaret trades linear reality for “brightened disquiet.” Her agency drives escalation: each bathroom breakthrough reweights understanding, narrowing options until she must pass the inheritance. Cost is unmistakable in the loss of authorial control (“notes rewrite themselves”) and identity fragmentation. Coincidence never resolves tension; all deepening stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rescuing Kael by proving the library’s necessity—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s scholarly deepening, not physical peril. Her agency drives every turn: packing minimally, studying gaps, cross-referencing catalogs, and finally speaking the omissions into existence. The cost is legible: she must surrender certainty to articulate ignorance, and Kael bears “sorrowful, terrible understanding” upon return. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens—each lacuna intensifies the textual weight until the mountain groans in concession.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity in the garden—is signaled early and tightens when the fog actively opposes the twin in the climax. Agency drives escalation: each use of the swatch card narrows options until the final swipe forces dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: sacrificing the ship (and past self) to access the garden. However, the fog’s resistance feels more atmospheric than causally pressurized under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resolving the door’s impossible presence—is signaled by line 2 and tightens when Elias realizes the seal was “misplaced in his records.” His agency drives escalation: touching seal to door, tracing braids, reconfiguring knots. Cost is conceptual (absence becomes responsibility) and physical (the seal pulses like a heart, binding him). Coincidence never resolves; the diplomat’s seal is earned through prior archival work. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tightening (e.g., rope resisting) could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving or restoring silence in a world overrun by chaotic energy—is signaled early and deepens through Lorne’s focused labor. The meaningful tightening occurs at the moment of convergence: he risks failure (like his predecessor) to conjure the bloom. Agency is clear—his deliberate touch, whispered words, and attunement drive the outcome. Cost is felt (weeks of tension, the bloom’s impermanence), though the energy beings’ threat remains abstract, slightly muting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring meaning through the beacon—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen risks everything on celestial alignment. The deepening occurs when he discovers the “shard of hush,” transforming technical repair into metaphysical act. Cost is felt (years of solitude, existential burden), though the lack of tangible opposition softens external pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the fog lifts—is signaled early and tightens as Kael discovers the fog has its own timeline. His agency lies in interpretation, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens, but the escalation hinges on passive discovery rather than a pressured choice that narrows options. Cost is felt (loss of whispers), yet no tactical shift occurs; he simply writes faster. Still, the deepening is resonant and thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through illumination—is signaled early and tightens when Marlo realizes stars’ absence isn’t cosmic abandonment but invitation to create light. Agency drives escalation: chanting filters awareness, torchlight reveals fragments, fire-spinning completes the message. Cost is visible in the expended knot and emotional labor of surrender-to-reveal. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Marlo’s craft (fire-spinning) enables the climax, satisfying Situational lens pressure under coherent stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—navigating relational transition—is signaled early via Mara’s aborted confession and deepens as Elian’s tangential method becomes the conduit for resolution. Pressure escalates texturally: silence thickens, water rises, constellations loom, until the cicada’s placement forces mutual vulnerability. Cost is legible in Mara’s softened expression (emotional exposure) and Elian’s shift from observer to participant. Agency lies in attention itself—choosing to interpret the in-between as meaningful—which reweights their shared reality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing unhearable silences—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s meticulous preparation. The inversion hour imposes a live clock; her floating ascent and absorption of layered quiet constitute active agency under pressure. Cost is felt in gravity’s violent return and the irreversible shift in perception. Coincidence never resolves tension; every beat stems from her ritualized pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the terrace’s balance through calibrated silence—is signaled early and deepens when the train whistle disrupts equilibrium. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her placement of the vial catalyzes the terrace’s hum, narrowing options to a single ritualistic act. Cost is felt in the air’s “heaviness” and the vial’s cloudiness, resolved only through her intervention. Coincidence (the train) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the protagonist’s choice earns the calm.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding the throne’s location before system purge—is signaled early and tightens via the sunrise deadline. Elias’s agency drives escalation: disabling guards, crossing the veil, peeling paint. Cost is legible: exile risk, irreversible exposure to forgotten knowledge, and the burden of secrecy. However, opposition is passive (guards disabled by flake, no active antagonist), reducing pressure; stakes remain intellectual rather than viscerally felt until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanctuary vs. risking connection—is signaled early and tightens when the threshold weakens. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her method of “linking through scars” attracts the encroaching presence, forcing the climactic choice. The cost—potential self-suffocation—is felt in the vibrating ring and dimming stars. One meaningful deepening suffices: realization that her healing gift draws the very darkness she fled.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting emotional pressure into tangible redemption—is signaled early and tightens at the convergence point. Leo’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to kneel, press the bolt, and pour his regret into the act. Cost is felt (years of debt, existential weight) and paid (bolt vanishes, past dissolves). However, the “quantum promise” resolution leans on coincidence rather than earned mechanics, slightly undercutting pressure coherence under a strict Causal lens—but acceptable under Accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and tightens when the great-grandfather reveals the truth resides in vibrations, not books. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his purposeful cranking transforms passive musing into active decoding. Cost is felt in the burden of inherited deception and the irreversible loss of dynastic myth. Coincidence is minimal; pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early and tightens when the knight unsnaps the gear, shattering night into dawn fragments. Pressure escalates texturally: fruits brighten, reality bends, shadows puppeteer. Cost is conceptual (loss of eternal night) and felt (the program blanks), though the knight faces no tangible sacrifice or opposition, slightly softening the escalation under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving overlooked kindnesses—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s discovery chain. Pressure escalates via accumulation: each artifact raises emotional stakes without external conflict. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses not to return the button, foreclosing passive custodianship for active curation. Cost is felt implicitly: his sorrow remains, but the work gains meaning. Agency is subtle yet decisive—attention becomes action, and that shift carries weight under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against state-sanctioned forgetting—is signaled early and escalates when Jenna vanishes, forcing Maya into solo action. The tightening is meaningful: only she remains, raising personal cost. Her agency drives the climax (activating Marcus’s reappearance), and the price is immediate (alarms, exposure). Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via accumulated relics and rituals culminating in a resonant, high-risk act.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the town’s memory—is signaled early and tightens critically at “This morning was critical.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: his “vested hush” technique actively counters spontaneous prophetic notes. The deepening comes via rising manifestations (bakery chime, church bells, children’s whistles), culminating in today’s final note. Cost is unmistakable: years of pre-dawn labor, emotional toll, and the perpetual burden of a battle no one else knows exists.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering Earth Below’s memory—is signaled early and tightens during the Three Moons alignment, when Elias’s agency (prodding the speck) forces transformation. Pressure escalates texturally: more specks unlock more memories, each deepening his role. Cost is felt in the loss of the tiny figure and the weight of infinite responsibility. Coincidence (folklore’s promise) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s ritual preparation earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending time vs. accepting its brokenness—is signaled early and tightens when the compass locks onto the waterfall, forcing a choice between control and surrender. The deepening occurs at the pedestal: realizing the clock reveals reality shifts, not measures time. Cost is visible in his abandoned clock parts, foreclosing his identity as a fixer. Escalation stems from his agency (improvising with the compass), though the waterfall’s roar borders on convenient resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding how love can exist on the edge of presence and absence—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s decision to literalize kintsugi. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses not to restore perfection but to honor fracture, narrowing his path from redemption to acceptance. Cost is felt: he abandons the fantasy of Lyra’s return, embracing solitude as active practice. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, though the escalation leans more on internal realization than external obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief through laughter—is signaled early and tightens with each confession. The collector’s agency drives escalation: he adjusts his tune, chases giggles, kneels in offering. Cost is legible: “weight of his work settling like ancient stones,” “luminous ache,” and the relinquished tooth. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern deepening (woman → child), not reversal, and the final renunciation (leaving the tooth) forecloses easy return, charging the path ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering mercy’s mathematics—is signaled early and tightens when trauma memory triggers the formula. The deepening occurs via Kael’s proprioceptive recall of the mask’s pressure, narrowing options to a single cognitive breakthrough. Cost is visible: enduring the “ghost weight” of torture to reach insight, with the forest itself as both obstacle and witness. Agency is internal but decisive; the protagonist’s unique trait drives the escalation, though the resolution leans slightly abstract for full causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering buried women’s histories—is signaled early and tightens when the painting reveals the lineage room, foreclosing passive observation. Agency is clear: her decision to “unfasten the truth” drives escalation. Cost is conceptual but legible: the weight of ancestral responsibility crystallizes in the final act of writing. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via cadence shift (babel → hum → silence), though the merchant’s convenience slightly dilutes oppositional force.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden histories—is signaled early and tightens when the dust swirl reveals the fall. The technician’s agency drives escalation: he climbs, extracts, and handles the barrel, triggering the ghost’s release. Cost is felt in the emotional weight of witnessing failure and the physical stumble from the ladder. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; understanding does. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—freedom from eternity’s cage—is signaled early and deepens through the frost’s warnings and the bottled whisper’s promise. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to pocket the bottle, to pull the lever, to leap. The cost is unmistakable: loss of his ordered world, his role, his very identity. The single tightening (pressing the page) forecloses his old life with irreversible consequence, satisfying the Accumulative lens’s demand for pattern break with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming emotional truth from sterile historiography—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen chooses private reimagination over public debate. Escalation is driven by his agency: devising and executing the mirror-veiling ritual narrows his options (he becomes a smuggler, not a scholar). Cost is unmistakable: he accepts marginalization to preserve authenticity. The meteor shower complicates but doesn’t resolve; his insight arises from prepared perception, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming Sevenbells’ stolen light—is signaled early and deepens through the town’s fading existence. Pressure escalates via the stone’s honesty test and the resonance chamber’s demands, narrowing Elara’s margin for error. Though coincidence introduces the stone (via chimney), it complicates rather than resolves; agency remains Elara’s throughout. The cost—town-wide despair nearly solidified into permanent shadow—is legible, though slightly abstract until dawn’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reaching the place beyond explanation—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens decisively when Elias abandons his vials, foreclosing his old identity. Agency drives escalation: psychometry leads to descent, which leads to dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: he trades his life’s method (collecting traces) for direct encounter, and the final image shows him climbing back into a world now “brimming with inexplicable magic”—a stance crystallized under coherent pressure. No coincidence resolves; the compass’s pull is consistent from first tremor to final placement.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose amid disorientation—is signaled early and deepens when the slide reframes her art as alliance-building. Escalation is driven by Lyra’s agency: she interprets, walks, retrieves, and places the slide. Cost is legible in lost certainty (GPS failure) and physical exposure (storm), though the price feels more atmospheric than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs at the lighthouse, where the mast image leads to a hidden key, narrowing her path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens into a thematic inquiry about unseen systems. Escalation occurs through Lena’s increasing absorption, culminating in the pavilion discovery that reweights her entire project. Cost is legible: her solitary pursuit transforms into public art, sacrificing intimacy for impact. Agency drives every turn—she seeks, arranges, kneels, interprets—but the absence of a tangible loss (time? health? relationships?) keeps cost conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the diary’s encryption floods Elias with visions, narrowing his options to direct parley. Each debris message (“FREE,” “WHY?,” “REMEMBER”) escalates pressure through protagonist agency, culminating in a trade-off: personal safety for historical witness. Cost is unmistakable—the ink bleeds onto his skin, the manacle scars his fall. Coincidence (lightning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the shape’s reply emerges from debris, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reimagining civilization without past mistakes—is signaled early and tightens when lanterns flicker during Elian’s hesitation, forcing a trade-off between ideals. His agency drives escalation: choosing balance narrows options irreversibly. Cost is felt in the weight of creation and the loss of solitude, though the “ghost town revival” never truly threatens failure, softening tension slightly. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—containing or channeling archived emotions—is signaled early via the foghorn’s silence and intensifies when Elias deciphers the wax. His agency drives escalation: choosing immersion transforms containment into conduit. Cost is legible (“no longer merely a keeper… but a vessel”) and forecloses his archival life. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—density of emotional patterns culminates in breach threat. Coincidence (finding the cylinder) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming the vortex inheritance from curse to command—is signaled early and deepens through the method of decreasing entropy. The tightening occurs when she chooses elegance over force, narrowing options to one precise ancestral key. Cost is legible: the frantic energy vanishes, replaced by serenity, implying lost intensity or speed. Agency is fully hers—no coincidence—but the escalation leans more on atmospheric accumulation than causal pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens yet slightly limiting tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ensuring effective storm warnings—tightens when electronic sirens fragment in thin air, forcing Elian to activate the bell failsafe. This meaningful deepening narrows options and reveals cost: his labor (glue drying, sensor recalibration) and isolation. Agency is clear in system-switching and three-tug signal, though escalation leans more on environmental pressure than internal conflict. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; preparation earns safety.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding connection through vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s empathetic practice. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from passive collection to active communion, narrowing her path to one of radical openness. Cost is felt in her physical attenuation and cosmic solitude, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses conventional belonging. Though escalation is internal and accumulative, it’s driven by her agency, not coincidence, satisfying the Situational/Accumulative hybrid pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile unity against external chaos—is signaled early and deepens when newer spirits threaten fracture. Elisha’s agency drives escalation: his interpretation triggers action, his ritual reknits the covenant. Cost is unmistakable: he endures solitude to maintain balance, and the oasis survives only through constant, wordless vigilance. While external antagonism is abstract (off-page hunters), pressure coheres internally and texturally, fulfilling Situational/Accumulative escalation with one meaningful tightening that reshapes the ghosts’ collective stance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost meaning in a world where numbers changed—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s realization that he’s part of a larger design. The tightening occurs when the urn fragment yields coordinates, narrowing his search to the silo’s depths. Cost is felt: his borrowed time intensifies urgency, though it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Agency is maintained through decoding and descent, but the resolution leans on discovery over sacrifice, softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose through mending brokenness—is signaled early and deepens when the snapped kite string triggers memory of “shattered promises.” The tightening occurs in the weaving act, which forecloses mere observation in favor of creation. Agency is clear: the poet chooses to weave, then to release. Cost is conceptual (accepting ephemerality) and felt (“heart quietly full” amid loss). Coincidence (snapped string) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from the poet’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking architectural secrets before death—is signaled early and tightens through Kaelen’s systematic remodel, which forecloses passive observation for active intervention. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each copper connection deepens the network, altering tactics as physical decline limits action. Cost is felt in his tremulous hands and fraying consciousness, yet pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens. Coincidence never resolves; all progression stems from Kaelen’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is signaled early and deepens as Aris moves from observer to participant. The meaningful tightening occurs at the pedestal: placing the amber forecloses his skeptical detachment, exacting emotional cost (loneliness, loss of intellectual armor). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the external “pilgrims” exert no direct opposition, reducing interpersonal stakes. Agency is internal but credible, driven by Aris’s own resistance and curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming harmony through seed-scattering—is signaled early and tightens when the tern’s cry forces action (“Now”). Pressure escalates via the coachman’s awareness of scale (“smallness of his solitary actions against the infinite scope of what had been lost”), deepening his resolve. Cost is felt in the “wounded earth” and his ancient hollow heart, though the lack of a tangible sacrifice (e.g., losing a pod, enduring physical toll) slightly softens the price. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to scatter despite futility.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with his sister—is signaled early and deepens via the riddle’s revelation. Elias’s agency drives escalation: mounting the cylinder, adjusting thermal settings, interpreting the leaf. Cost is felt in his years of searching and the emotional risk of hope; the bridge at dawn represents narrowed options. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—every clue stems from his skill and prior knowledge of his sister’s methods.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming isolation into meaningful exploration—is signaled early and deepens when the phantom sky appears. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to map the ghost, narrowing his path from remembrance to cartography. Cost is felt in the silence replaced by defiant sound, and the irreversible shift from survivor to pioneer. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing joyless perfection—is signaled early and tightens via the chess ritual, which forces trade-offs (map for meteorite code). Protagonist agency drives escalation: Kaelen initiates the heist, chooses the unguarded path, and offers his queen. Cost is visible in emotional toll (“heartbeat frantic”) and relational rupture. Slight deduction: the Architect’s sudden shift from guard to collaborator lacks intermediate pressure, making the resolution feel slightly more gift than earned combat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—documenting erased human gestures—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that her trauma must be lived, not performed. The interregnum creates live pressure: history is unwritten, so her work is urgent. Her agency manifests in walking, kneeling, spelling—each act narrowing her role from performer to witness. Cost is felt in the weight of each missing pawn, though escalation leans textual rather than causal; one tightening suffices, but a sharper tactical shift would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming “home” as a state of being, not a place—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the stone’s language reveals reality-seeding. Each experiment raises stakes: the “hidden thunder” grows, the bookstore responds, and the final seeded reality risks total departure. Agency is clear: she chooses to touch feather and stone, to practice nightly, to create the memory landscape. Cost is felt in the irreversible step toward leaving this world, framed as both loss and liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens via the labyrinth’s ruthless logic: each platform demands sacrifice. The tutor’s agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is felt in the trembling fingers and phantom pieces, culminating in the visible price of enduring rain without flinching. One tightening suffices: the transition from external puzzle (tapestry) to internal crucible (stalemate board) deepens stakes without fracturing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus communal peace—is signaled early and tightens when Elaran realizes his poetry weakens the seal. His agency drives escalation: each verse session raises stakes, culminating in the vortex that crumbles the spire. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits innocence and risks exile. The “one meaningful deepening” (truth as spectrum vs. single doctrine) narrows his options decisively before dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and deepens via the alchemist’s agency: he chooses to narrate even submerged. The wave crash narrows options (must hold breath, rely on memory alone), raising cost. Final turn isn’t luck but earned endurance: his belief in brokenness-as-purpose reconfigures reality. Cost is felt in gasped breaths, corroded hull, and lifelong retrieval labor.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a private promise about impermanence—is signaled early and tightens when the shell dissolves, foreclosing preservation as an option. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his deliberate walk into the unknown, kneeling, and submersion. Cost is felt in the loss of the artifact and the irreversible surrender of control. Coincidence (the alley) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn comes from his choice within the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating his theory that pure-intent whispers travel farther—is signaled early and deepens through the ritualized ascent and focus on the cork. Pressure escalates texturally: heat amplifies noise, then cool air permits silence, then scent manifests intention. The tightening occurs when Elias chooses not to speak but to channel desire through the cork—a renunciation that forecloses conventional communication. Cost is visible in his trembling hands and the irreversible release; however, the stakes remain internal, limiting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating loss—is signaled early and deepens when the censer foot “grew hot,” forcing the final line. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses not to answer the phone, trusting instinct over external input. Cost is unmistakable in “map would fade” and “sea had taken everything.” The moon-phase constraint shapes tactics (timing, emotional calibration) with tangible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—psychological privacy—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger appears, forcing Elara to choose between hoarding safety or risking connection. The meaningful deepening occurs when truthfulness broadcasts fear, escalating tension beyond physical danger to relational exposure. Cost is felt: the truffle is abandoned, and the glass eye’s power is tested mid-storm. Agency drives escalation—Elara chooses solitude-memory despite near-impossibility—but the resolution leans slightly on coincidence (stranger’s timely arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding a final gesture of faithfulness—is signaled early and deepens through Hemlock’s investigation. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he consults his logbook, cross-references memories, and interprets gaps. The tightening occurs when past notation merges with borrowed memory, revealing the woman’s doomed quest. Cost is felt: Hemlock inherits her unresolved love, transforming passive witness into active commemoration. Coincidence (finding the flower) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns truth through method, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over one’s life path—is signaled early (“weight of their silence pressed heavier”). Pressure escalates through sensory cues (chip’s warmth, ants’ direction) that Elias interprets via his empirically intuitive mind, narrowing options until only one choice remains: enter or remain static. Cost is felt in decades of stagnation; the creek’s rise externalizes urgency. Coincidence (ants appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he follows, interprets, acts.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—identity versus duty—is signaled early and tightens when the seneschal appears, forcing shared vulnerability. The queen’s climb (agency) escalates pressure until the grotto forces renunciation: she cannot be both guardian and monarch. Cost is unmistakable (“kingdom beginning to fracture”) and arises from her choice, not coincidence. Minor deduction: the seneschal’s emerald eyes slightly ease tension by confirming alliance, softening the isolation implied earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming ephemeral truth into enduring form—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s secret demands revaluation of convergence/resonance. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses method (“by returning differently”), manipulates tools, and hardens resolve into action. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing linear time/memory) and visible in the pocket-sun’s dimming. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the emotional price lacks visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling foreknowledge of death with the desire to narrate meaning—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to write “not of tonight’s dreams, but of yesterday’s tomorrow.” This act deepens pressure by committing to narrative over despair. The cost is felt in bodily terms (“limbs that felt both ancient and adolescent”) and existential ones (“calculating how many breaths remained”). Agency drives escalation: his method of jealousy becomes a lens, then a trap, then a reframed freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning from loss—is signaled early and deepened through the screw’s discovery. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elara chooses to examine, remember, and ultimately resume work. Cost is felt in phantom absence and trembling hands, though the inscription’s revelation leans slightly toward convenience. Still, the trade-off is credible: she exchanges numbness for the burden—and gift—of inherited memory, crystallized in her steady hands at story’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into story—tightens when Aeris abandons academic runes for a child’s prayer, narrowing options to raw vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: his choice to embrace absurdity (“clutch night-sky”) directly triggers crystallization. Cost is unmistakable: his hand becomes mineral, the quill sheds its magic, and solace arrives only after irreversible bodily change. The “held breath” timeframe intensifies pressure, making each micro-choice feel urgent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology—is signaled early and tightens under dual pressures: the archive’s demolition and Alistair’s stubborn silence. Eloise’s agency drives escalation: she abandons metaphor for direct current, risking failure. The cost is legible in her admission: “I’ve been running from it ever since.” The orchard’s falling trees loom as irreversible loss, making this final attempt urgent and irreplaceable. Coincidence never resolves; peace comes only through earned confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions via spiral arbitration—is signaled early and deepens through the dictionary’s transformation and the library’s responsiveness. Pressure escalates texturally: from carrying the book, to interpreting shimmering words, to confronting floating vocabularies, culminating in surrendering accumulated witnessing. Yet agency is diffuse; the protagonist follows a “third path” but never makes a hard choice that forecloses alternatives. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) but not viscerally felt—no stamina, time, or relational price alters tactics. The escalation relies on atmosphere over decisive action, fitting the lens but limiting emotional traction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens when Elias detects the “stutter” during backward counting. His agency drives escalation: he chooses the method, observes the anomaly, and reinterprets decades of logs. Cost is conceptual but legible: he surrenders the belief in objective measurement, accepting that human order imposes falsity on temporal flow. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening is intellectual rather than physical.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding/revolutionizing boundaries—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes his error: letting go is connection, not escape. The tightening occurs in his renunciation of intrusion detection for openness, with conceptual cost (abandoning his old framework). Agency is maintained: both characters choose collaboration. However, escalation leans more on atmosphere than concrete opposition—pressure is internal and philosophical, which fits the lens but lacks visceral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—widening the father’s perspective through chaos—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara risks his disapproval by collecting “irresponsible” data. The escalation is driven by her agency: each scrawl deepens her resolve, culminating in the notebook’s delivery. Cost is unmistakable—the fragility of her hope, the guilt of betraying his legacy—and crystallizes in the Charged Poise of the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching endings how to begin—is signaled early and deepens through each call’s emotional weight. The meaningful tightening occurs in Archie’s dawning awareness that he, too, is mid-loop, awaiting his own final call. Agency manifests as renunciation: he refuses to break the cycle, accepting the cost of eternal mediation. Pressure accumulates texturally (layered conversations, disc vibrations) rather than causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses escape but affirms purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving moments to sustain the covenant—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to document Melina’s proximate causes, risking emotional collapse. The deepening (“tonight was different”) narrows his path to final surrender. Agency drives escalation: his archival method forces confrontation with loss. Cost is felt in relinquishing the locket, though the covenant’s mechanics slightly soften the price by framing it as reciprocal.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—relieving chronic loneliness—is signaled early and deepens when Orion realizes connection can’t be bartered. The tightening occurs at the ladder: he must trade his moon rock not for a person but for a practice (listening), foreclosing his transactional approach. Agency is clear: his choice to ascend and stay still is active renunciation. Cost is felt—the loss of his logistical certainty, replaced by vulnerable openness—though slightly muted by the absence of tangible consequence beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to quiet inner turmoil—is signaled early and deepens as notes coalesce into melody. Agency is expressed through dowsing choices that narrow options: each note commits him deeper, culminating in the B flat that forces him to his knees—a physical manifestation of emotional cost. The escalation is protagonist-driven (not coincidental), and the price—years of unrest surrendered for stillness—is felt in the ring’s cooling and his empty-but-full hands. Pressure tightens texturally, not causally, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—editing history to reconcile doubt—is signaled early and deepens when the interpreter rejects erasure for acceptance. Agency drives escalation: unbending the nib, rewriting twice, choosing imperfect growth. Cost is unmistakable (“weight of the loss,” “lonely” garden now bearing fruit). Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tightening might elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—making the forgotten remembered—is signaled early and deepens through Lyra’s signing and Julian’s futile photography. The meaningful tightening occurs when they shift from documentation to co-creation (“translate this silence into music”). Agency is present in their ritualized performance, though external opposition is absent; pressure is internal and atmospheric. Cost is conceptual (solitude, futility) but lacks tangible consequence—no lost opportunity, tool failure, or social repercussion grounds the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering erased truth—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s artistic reconstructions, each narrowing her path toward restoration. The cracked vase → rose and shattered mirror → self-portrait beats deepen her commitment while raising emotional stakes. Agency is consistent: she chooses creation over silence, then ritual burning over preservation. However, escalation leans heavily on internal pressure; external or systemic opposition is absent, muting the cost’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the shared dream against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Kael’s drumming shifts from primal urgency to heartbeat gentleness, foreclosing sterile control. Escalation is driven by his agency: each rhythmic choice deepens resonance until the garden “bursts into full bloom.” Cost is unmistakable: “auroral sorrow” as bittersweet undercurrent, the burden lifted only after visceral effort. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through his sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating Kael’s theory—is signaled early and tested on-page via Jenna’s shout versus Kael’s whisper. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael reveals the key isn’t for a door but the labyrinth’s heart, reweighting the entire challenge. Cost is visible: Kael surrenders the coin, but gains collaborative awe. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under a Causal lens, though the storm’s role edges toward convenient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Anna’s unresolved grief—is signaled early and deepens via the guardian’s pattern, which reconfigures her understanding of her father’s silence. The tightening occurs when she steps into the viewing spot, foreclosing her prior isolation with emotional cost (tears, vulnerability). Agency lies in the guardian’s precise adjustments and Anna’s choice to approach. Minor deduction: the “harmonic hum” of the secret feels atmospheric rather than pressurizing; stakes escalate texturally but lack a concrete obstacle beyond Anna’s own hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming how people think about power—is signaled early and deepens through Arthur’s quiet orchestration. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: planning, recruiting, positioning displays. The tightening is conceptual: from isolated chess lessons to town-wide questioning. Cost is felt in vulnerability (“What if they don’t understand?”) and the ever-present risk of discovery. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from deliberate, fragile action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-embrace—is signaled early and tightens when the scrimshaw hums, forcing a choice. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she dives, swims faster, plucks the charm. Cost is felt (“detach from the life she’d left”) and visible in her changed movement at the dock. Yet the whale’s call functions more as mystical summons than coherent pressure—it complicates but nearly resolves, leaning on coincidence rather than earned causality under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic grief under emotional regulation—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector arrives. Elara’s agency drives escalation: hiding flowers, carving birds, performing contentment. The cost is constant (risk of discovery, emotional labor of stillness) and culminates in the hummingbird placement—a visible price paid in secrecy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—crossing the sacred boundary—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes language fails and intent is required. His agency drives escalation: studying, approaching, pressing palms, dissolving. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of his prior identity and mode of artistry. However, opposition is passive (a hum, not an antagonist), limiting friction; the ban’s lift removes external resistance, making the conflict largely internal and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—gaining color perception—is signaled early and deepens through the barter’s terms. Leo’s agency drives escalation: he crafts increasingly complex arrangements, culminating in the white lily gambit. The cost (garden labor) is visible and shapes the final image. While coincidence (the reed’s post-phoenix properties) enables the premise, resolution hinges on Leo’s persistent, rule-bending strategy—not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s shift from cataloging absence to creating resonance. Agency is clear: striking the fork, stepping into the halo, declaring assumptions as cages. The tightening occurs when vibration replaces search, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is felt as the relinquishment of the “artificial” frame, though it remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative purpose—is signaled early and deepens when Elian shifts from making mourning jewelry to embedding coordinates. The meaningful tightening occurs when he teaches others to fold metal flowers, foreclosing passive remembrance in favor of active transmission. Cost is legible: he remains alone in the observatory, his life repurposed but not healed. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each student extends his mission, bending time itself—without coincidence resolving core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mapping hidden cultural patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confides in Chen, risking exposure of her unconventional method. The tightening occurs when she reveals the twenty-year cycle, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is felt in generational weight and intellectual isolation. Escalation is driven by her agency (multiplying paths, choosing to share), though the external pressure from society remains implied rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge—intensifies as the historian risks psychological rupture to purify the atoms of nostalgia. Escalation occurs through her ritual, which demands “steadily unpredictable” movement, narrowing options by forbidding repetition. The cost is felt in the irreversible loss of innocence and the weight of responsibility. While agency drives the climax, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; the absence of external opposition or tangible consequence beyond internal transformation slightly limits pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes shadows unbind as hope fragments. Her agency drives escalation: comparing footage leads to stone activation, which triggers library metamorphosis. Cost is legible in “luminous regret” for lost hopes and the irreversible acceptance that preservation requires containment, not restoration. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each revelation deepening thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—balancing self-respect with compassion—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor presents the “move on” alternative, forcing Maria to articulate her need for truth. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her reconstruction of logs narrows options to either perpetuate lies or rebuild authentically. Cost is felt in her admission of self-deception. Under Accumulative lens, the single deepening suffices, though a second tactical consequence would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to erase or interpret scars—is signaled early and deepens when plant telepathy reveals the cost of Maya’s technique. The tightening occurs when she recognizes her father’s ghost in Samuel’s case, forcing a trade-off: professional pride vs. ethical restitution. Agency drives escalation—her choice to visit Samuel unarmed with tools forecloses her old practice. Cost is felt in her tears and the orchid’s sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens into existential urgency. Pressure escalates through the gazer’s tactile communion, narrowing from spatial to temporal understanding. The tightening occurs when he realizes love resides in “cutting-room moments,” foreclosing his initial spatial hypothesis. Cost is felt: peace comes only after accepting his love’s archival fate, not its expression.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—is signaled early and deepens through three meteor traces, each narrowing Elara’s psychological resistance. Agency is clear: she obeys, complies, doesn’t stop. The tightening isn’t causal but accumulative—each star intensifies the hum of possibility until surrender becomes inevitable. Cost is felt (exhaustion, emotional weight lifting like melting snow) and visible (collapsed knees, settled stardust). However, escalation relies on repetition rather than compounding consequence, slightly softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring possibility without erasing divergence—is signaled early and tightens when the guard must choose which seedling future to nurture. Escalation occurs through his agency: learning to “charm quantum foam” deepens his capacity, raising the cost of failure (withering vs. alien growth). The trade-off is clear: one timeline flourishes only during eclipses, another risks toxicity—options narrowed by his intervention. Coincidence never resolves; success stems from practiced technique and dreamless focus.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding consciousness vs. machinery—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the convergence point, where Elian’s method transforms random translocation into controlled journey. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: listening, placing the gear, focusing on the symphony. Cost is conceptual but legible—the loss of disorientation’s terror replaced by responsibility of attunement—and felt in the gear’s irreversible change. Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from accumulated attention.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens through the traversal’s uncertainty. Pressure escalates texturally: each star-punch tightens the path’s visibility, demanding greater trust in indirect routes. The traveler’s agency is passive but consistent with the mythic frame; cost is conceptual (abandoning known identity) and felt in the pool scene. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—guides enable but don’t dictate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—truth versus enforced silence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the bellhop finds the ledger, transforming abstract unease into concrete moral obligation. His agency drives escalation: he investigates, pockets evidence, unlocks the piano, and chooses to remain. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts his own erasure (“nerve regeneration would come for him too”) to bear witness. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail deepening the thematic weight rather than narrowing physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender who stole reality—is signaled early and deepens through accumulating doubt in the kingdom. Kael’s agency is quiet but decisive: each rune is a tactical choice that narrows the usurper’s options. The final confrontation crystallizes pressure into a single spoken line with irreversible consequence. Cost is unmistakable: centuries of solitude, the last ink pellet, and the library’s purpose fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding disappearance—is signaled early and deepens when Elias connects the atlas folds to tide data, narrowing his focus from passive witness to active interpreter. The meaningful tightening occurs when he matches his tapping to the tide, triggering the console’s rearrangement—a choice that reconfigures knowledge. Cost is felt conceptually (accepting impermanence) and emotionally (releasing grief), though no tangible sacrifice (e.g., abandoning the station) sharpens the price. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency under an Accumulative lens, satisfying band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in a stalled rebellion—is signaled early and tightens when the stone circle offers not victory but purpose. Her agency lies in attention and endurance, not battle; the cost is isolation and the burden of renewal. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → hum → spark → resolve. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the stones’ power is mysterious but consistent with the world’s established mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing the embryo from predetermined fate—is signaled early and tightens when Maeva decodes the script, narrowing options to a single ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each discovery (kite, script, embryo) deepens knowledge and raises stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she violates curfew and shatters ancestral protection. Coincidence (finding the kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the unsealing is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—integrating grief without surrender—is signaled early and deepens when Maya’s traumatic freeze shifts to transcendent stillness during transplanting. This single, meaningful intensification narrows her emotional options: she can no longer hide the photo. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the crumpled paper’s smoothing—a quiet but irreversible act. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding a shattered self—is signaled early and deepens through the artist’s decision to “descend into necessary darkness.” The tightening occurs when he chooses to mend the box despite its fragility, foreclosing passive despair. Cost is felt (“sticky with salt and time”) and visible in his hardened resolve. Though escalation is internal, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering time’s distortion in crisis—is signaled early and deepens when the ink reveals a “blueprint of time’s elasticity.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael chooses to trust the vanishing patterns over physical proof, risking total loss for insight. Agency is clear: he adjusts the drone, spills the ink, traces the map—all deliberate acts under pressure. Cost is felt: years of marginal existence culminate in a revelation that cannot be held, only witnessed. Coincidence (eclipse) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael’s method earns the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes (“contraband truths,” societal collapse) are declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. Elara faces no resistance, consequence, or tactical adaptation—her act succeeds instantly and universally. The dominant stake lacks escalation; it’s announced, enacted, and echoed without friction, rendering conflict abstract and cost ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—peace vs. inherited violence—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elara’s ritualized renunciation (sheathing the knife). Pressure escalates texturally: winds evoke gunfire, merchants bring outside chaos, yet she retreats to creation. The tightening occurs in her steadfast refusal to engage the sky-world, foreclosing her father’s path with emotional cost. Agency lies in endurance, not action, consistent with Situational/Accumulative design, though the lack of an on-page opposing force slightly softens confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens when the unstable sky offers a rare chance. The fisher’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to voice silence via zigzagging, directly causing the garden’s hum to falter and stars to sync. Cost is unmistakable: his soul is “raw,” and post-catch, the burden alters his inner world permanently. Under Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the entire endeavor with emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing the truth behind her parents’ deaths—is signaled early and tightens when the nib’s bend contradicts “grief.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to search, interpret, and commit to intervention. The cost (personal danger, destabilizing legacy) is felt in the final lines. Coincidence (the journalist’s call) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the killer’s pattern is inferred causally.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—Orion’s need to resolve guilt over his daughter’s silenced cries—is signaled early (“reasons remained shadowed like lunar eclipses”) and tightens when the amber reveals his own voice apologizing. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to touch the amber, interpret its message, and tattoo Lacerta, transforming firmware resistance into harmony. Cost is unmistakable: years of souring equipment and trembling hands, paid off in earned peace. Coincidence (meteor-fall amber) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Orion’s choice to tether memory properly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning amid erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the tile flake responds to the mandala, narrowing Elara’s options to interjection rather than resistance. Agency is clear: she chooses to press her palm into the sand, crystallizing her stance. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: society’s forgotten truths are not recovered but recontextualized. While pressure accumulates texturally, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off (e.g., physical toll or irreversible sacrifice), slightly muting the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—remaking grief through renaming—is signaled early and deepens when the tessera fits, shifting ghosts from “wraiths of terror” to “witnesses.” Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: her choice to rename the lion tightens options (she commits to endless work) with felt cost (retrocognitive loops, grounding pain). Under the Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the world responds to her act, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—saving the theater through performance—is signaled early and deepens when demolition news arrives as “bitter almond.” Arthur’s agency intensifies: he doesn’t wait for applause but actively “lures possibility” via amplified echoes. The tarot coin raises pressure by magnifying his power, forcing a final act with visible cost (his personal encore sacrificed for collective future). Coincidence complicates (developer’s vision) but resolution stems from Arthur’s choice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—filtering psychic noise before it erodes her—is signaled early and deepens through embodied practice. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from passive suffering to active translation via somatic markers. Agency drives escalation: her dance imposes order on chaos. Cost is felt (aching body, mental fatigue) and visible in the final stillness. No false resolution; the noise persists but is now mapped.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silence—is signaled early and deepens when the fossil floats, transforming passive mapping into active communion. The escalation is driven by Elara’s choice to engage the method, not coincidence, and the cost is conceptual: she surrenders objectivity for conduitship. Pressure tightens spatially (walls narrow) and emotionally (silence → melody), culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses mere documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rewriting fate through cataloging—is signaled early and escalates via the ticking hourglass and intensifying resonance of the echo. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes the prophecy is a “tapestry of choices,” narrowing her path to one final button placement. Cost is felt (urgency, trembling hands) and conceptual (the loss of fixed destiny). Yet escalation relies more on accumulation than protagonist-driven agency; she follows a method rather than wrestles with alternatives under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fixing what’s broken for Althea—is signaled early and tightens when the pillbox reveals her name. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to walk into a probable trap and creates a counter-message. The cost is clear: his anonymity, safety, and past identity are forfeited to secure her future. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens—each sensory and emotional layer intensifies the moral weight without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling the palimpsest promise—is signaled early and deepens through ambient pressure (silence, fog, ticking gutters). The single meaningful tightening occurs when whispers coalesce into “it was time,” forcing the coachman to act. Agency is internal but decisive: his choice to rise and walk is the culmination of sustained attention. Cost is felt (emotional weight lifted only after years of burden), though the brother-figure’s arrival leans slightly on coincidence rather than fully earned causality under strict Causal lens—but acceptable under Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist decay—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes resistance is preservation. Pressure tightens at the nexus: air grows “hostile,” thrum peaks, demanding stance crystallization. His agency lies in renunciation (no forcing, only offering calm), which forecloses repair but earns peace. Cost is felt—the vanished bee, dissipated fractures—though escalation leans slightly more on discovery than active choice; still, his patience shapes the resolution under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—combating spiritual darkness through reflected light—is signaled early and deepens via weekly winter maintenance. Agency is expressed through endurance and attention, not confrontation. The meaningful tightening occurs at 2:17 AM with the moon’s alignment, foreclosing error. Cost is felt in the gardener’s protected vulnerability and unseen labor, though escalation leans textual over causal.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into self-reliant purpose—is signaled early and deepens via the “brittle awakenings” motif. Escalation occurs through accumulated realizations, not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt: seasons of sorrow, the weight of memory, the risk of hope. Though agency is internal, her final decision to become a “guardian of memory” narrows her path from passive survivor to active bridge, with conceptual cost embedded in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting the frayed thread of meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the storm clears, offering a window for clarity. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the nest’s shape into the sculpture, risking further fragmentation but enabling synthesis. Cost is legible in his relinquishment of separateness; the flood of secrets isn’t relief but reconfiguration. Coincidence (storm, art installation) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the breakthrough stems from his interpretive act.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting humanity from manipulative cosmic influence—is signaled early and tightens at 2:17 AM, when failure risks exposure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she repurposes existing tech, acting alone under institutional threat. Cost is visible (career, isolation), though the “power plays” among departments feel abstract rather than personally pressuring. One meaningful deepening occurs (realizing signals respond to media), but external antagonism remains off-stage, softening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring spatial order—is signaled early and deepens via the organ’s role as reality’s anchor. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she calculates coordinates, presses the compass, broadcasts the pattern—all under accumulating pressure of mutating geometry. Cost is felt in her claustrophobic strain, yet the mutiny’s threat lacks concrete on-page consequence beyond description (e.g., no near-loss of self or tool), softening the price paid during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy for the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from drawing landscape to conjuring Lena’s hand: a choice that risks sentimentality but earns pathos through discipline. Cost is felt in his isolation and uncertainty (“maybe no one would find it”), yet he endures. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, intensifying via textual density, not external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring ancestral bravery through action—is signaled early and deepens when Elias learns the station is a containment field. The tightening choice (aligning dangerous coordinates) narrows options: open the door or preserve silence. Cost is unmistakable: enduring exile versus risking chaos. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. The moral calculus (bravery as silence vs. revelation) sharpens the peak turn with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the hitchhiker’s message—is signaled early and deepens into bridging worlds. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she investigates scaffold flutters, deciphers the map, and plays new melodies. The tightening occurs when she realizes her role isn’t passive witness but active conduit. Cost is felt as social isolation (“locals dismissed it”) and existential burden, though not dramatized in a decisive physical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to replicate or reject his father’s legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Elena’s app mirrors highway robbery’s predictive logic. Jasper’s agency shines in his silent exit from the boardroom, a renunciation that forecloses financial success but preserves moral clarity. Cost is felt in Elena’s diminished return and the added worthless currencies, though the escalation leans slightly abstract during the startup’s fall. One meaningful tightening suffices, and protagonist-driven choice anchors the peak turn.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions to prevent future harm—is signaled early and deepens when linked to personal loss. The tightening occurs at midnight: time forces confrontation, knowledge shifts, and isolation gives way to partnership. Cost is felt (grief, burden) but not visibly paid in action; no tool is lost, no irreversible choice made. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens, though agency leans more on revelation than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding himself—is signaled early and deepens when the failed magic trick raises the cost of failure. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to step into the water, whisper the spell, release the seed. The price—surrendering his guardedness—is legible in the “heaviest chain” metaphor and his physical unbending. One tightening suffices, though the vortex’s pull could exert more active resistance to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring covenant communication—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the future broke the pact from loneliness, not malice. His agency drives escalation: choosing to link scars transforms passive vision into active bridge-making. Cost is unmistakable—the searing flash unravels his consciousness, and the covenant remains imperfect post-act. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: emotional density intensifies until the nexus confrontation forces recognition, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing a fractured destiny—is signaled early and deepens when Elian trades self-redemption for mutual healing. The tightening occurs at the altar: placing the card initiates binding, not control. Agency is clear—his whispered “trade” forces a reciprocal exchange with tangible cost (memories absorbed, card destroyed). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no false resolutions or convenient escapes.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering purpose after loss—is signaled early and deepens when Leo realizes his career ended not at the botched soundcheck but when he stopped caring about “what happened after the applause.” This tightening reweights his entire task: appraising becomes witnessing. Agency is exercised through attention and renunciation (leaving the inventory), with visible cost (abandoning income, professional detachment). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, escalating via density of memory and sensory detail until the cloth forces a stance shift. No coincidence resolves; insight arises from sustained engagement with the object.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—completing Hamid’s research to bridge “touching distance”—tightens meaningfully when Maris shifts from documentation to planting the seed, accepting emotional risk. The deepening occurs via her analogical breakthrough, which reweights consciousness as transitional, raising the conceptual stakes. Cost is felt in loneliness and urgency, though not materially (no tool lost, time forfeited); the price remains primarily emotional, which fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a tangible sacrifice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through cyclical transformation—is signaled early and deepens via the smelting ritual, which fuses practical (metal repair) and mystical (ink creation) labor. Pressure tightens as Elara’s time narrows before her identity yields to Elias, forcing completion of inscription. Cost is conceptual: wisdom is ephemeral, visible only until the next moon. While escalation is subtle under the Accumulative lens, it lacks a decisive narrowing of options—Elara’s actions feel inevitable, not pressured by meaningful opposition or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolving emotional bunkers—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to share confessions, risking professional credibility. Agency drives escalation: his method emerges through dreams, then deliberate action. Cost is felt in exposed vulnerability (“tears streamed down cheeks”) and irreversible community formation. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when graffiti offers ambiguous direction, forcing Elias to choose between chasing redemption (north) or accepting it (south). His agency drives escalation: methodical tracing → facing memory → releasing bellows. Cost is felt in the relinquished object and abandoned map logic. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via density of resonant fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens as propagation delays lengthen, enabling passage through temporal fissures. The dreamer’s agency drives escalation: her documentation creates the very conditions for deeper revelation. Cost is felt in the accelerating watch and vanishing library; once the cipher completes, the space recedes permanently. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—each backward rotation adds a layer of meaning, culminating in irreversible understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—weighing personal dream against imperial control—is signaled early and tightens as coffee stains reveal intertwined destinies. Clementine’s agency drives escalation: she reads, listens, plays, chooses. The cost is legible: she forfeits safety, position, and perhaps timeline stability. The Imperial Agent’s arrival externalizes pressure, but the true conflict is internal—her telepathy and intuition versus institutional power. One tightening suffices, and it forecloses empire-aligned futures with poetic finality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing a final spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s focused effort. Escalation occurs via Accumulative pressure: silence → static → faint signal → full memory surge, culminating in the gem’s flare. The cost is conceptual (the inevitability of loss, mitigated only by preservation) and felt in the “radiant hush” and “weight of purpose.” Yet the conflict lacks tangible opposition or trade-off; success feels assured by skill alone, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment—is signaled early and tightens through the climb, culminating in the realization that contentment lies in caretaking itself. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each ascent reweights her understanding, and the decision to lay the hairpin by the pool embodies renunciation with cost (releasing personal attachment to serve another soul). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the absence of external opposition limits tactical friction; stakes are internal but viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unhooking certainty through protected vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens via Lyra’s question about “the source of the whispers.” Elian’s agency drives escalation: he selects chimes that translate her query into sonic nuance, narrowing the brother’s epistemic options without direct confrontation. Cost is felt in Lyra’s tears and Elian’s enduring doubt; the method’s success hinges on what isn’t said. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish in order to appear—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s trance, where understanding requires surrendering control. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael withholds the answer, forcing Elara into experiential discovery. Cost is conceptual: she must risk dissolution to gain agency. Though pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the absence of tangible consequence (e.g., exhaustion, disorientation) slightly mutes the stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mastering navigation without movement—is signaled early and deepens when the arrowhead reveals itself as a vessel. Pressure escalates via Kael’s attunement: each bird formation tightens his understanding until impact and lingering consciousness force a reweighting of purpose. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he must abandon physical traversal to access the canyon’s symphony. Agency is pure attention, yet it forecloses a path with profound existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming magic’s soul—is signaled early and deepens when Kael risks death during diagnostics. Escalation is protagonist-driven: unstrapping tools → mist walking → keystone placement, each narrowing options (no retreat once on railing). Cost is felt in his stinging lungs and the summit’s abandonment, but the automated systems’ ignorance slightly softens consequence—they remain unchallenged, making Kael’s victory purely personal. Still, the trade-off (authenticity over recognition) crystallizes under pressure with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering his brother’s synesthesia to fulfill a luminous vow—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual dive. Agency is clear: Orion chooses deception, isolation, and risk. The tightening occurs when he uses the key to access the journal during the lantern convergence—a live deadline that narrows options. Cost is felt: years lost, truth deferred, and now a new burden of perception. Coincidence complicates (meteor hush), but resolution is earned through his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—encoding humanity’s final message—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes lot-casting is calibration. The meaningful deepening occurs at “Her purpose crystallized”: stakes shift from transmission to wavelength alignment across cosmic death/rebirth. Agency is clear (her fingers dance, she casts), and cost is conceptual (dissolution into pattern) yet felt. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—grieving Elara through naming fears—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: each name crystallizes a monster, narrowing his emotional evasion. Cost escalates visibly (chest ache → frozen tears → lighter grief). The tightening culminates in Charged Poise: he walks away, stakes reconfigured by remembrance. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance via the bell—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s method (measuring drips) proves inadequate alone; the tightening occurs when he accepts tuning over fixing. Agency is clear: his meager magic coaxes steadier drips, enabling the bell’s repair. Cost is felt—exhausted magic, lingering dryness—but the viaduct’s note reweights stakes: balance isn’t restoration but attunement. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: drip cadence intensifies pressure until the resonant payoff, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the photo ritual. Pressure escalates not via external threat but internal intensification: the wind’s silence thins the veil, demanding action. The warden’s agency lies in attention and placement; each photo forecloses forgetting. Cost is felt in the solitude, the curling edges of memory, the burden of being the sole storyteller—but the reservoir never breaches, so external stakes remain abstract, slightly muting visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—achieving harmony between logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens when the starlings’ spiral demands precise flame adjustment, narrowing options to one fragile method. Agency is clear: Elara chooses wonder over measurement at the climax. Cost is felt as surrender of intellectual dominance (“never admit it to colleagues”) and emotional exposure (sentimentality). Escalation is driven by protagonist’s interpretation of natural patterns, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust amid void—is signaled early and tightens when static clears, forcing the seeker to act on fragmented data. Agency manifests through revision: rechecking knots, adjusting course, leaping without confirmation. Cost is felt in the harness bite and inherited trauma of the lost jumper. Escalation stems from protagonist choices, not coincidence, though the radio’s return leans slightly toward grace over earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—custody of the original brain as proof of non-copied existence—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes he must make the brain *choose*. The meaningful deepening occurs when vivification becomes necessary, narrowing options: win by feeling what the clone cannot. Cost is unmistakable: victory brings isolation, not wholeness. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency under causal pressure; coincidence (collapsing timelines) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving space for the unknown—tightens meaningfully when Elias abandons instrumental analysis (“He couldn't just plant it”) and chooses coexistence. This deepening reweights his entire methodology, narrowing options from active interrogation to patient witness. The cost is felt: relinquishing control, tolerating ambiguity. Though pressure remains internal, it escalates credibly through his failed attempts (loupe, sensor, meditation), culminating in a stance shift that crystallizes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elias’s escalating physical and emotional investment. His agency drives escalation: humming → singing → chanting, each intensifying the wind’s “macerating” effect. Cost is unmistakable: burning muscles, slick sweat, near-collapse. The tightening occurs when he focuses on the darkest wall patch—a tactical narrowing that makes the climax feel earned, not magical.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving uncertainty against absolutism—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant’s “vortex of belief” violates Sylvan’s domain. His agency lies in attention, not action: choosing to internalize rather than destroy creates palpable tension. The meaningful tightening occurs when he recognizes the pendant’s certainty as “another form of uncertainty,” reframing opposition into kinship. Cost is felt in his flaring homesickness and visible in the pendant’s softened spin—proof that stakes are viscerally, not abstractly, held.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from suffocating destiny—is signaled early and deepens through each approximation, narrowing options until only creative destruction remains viable. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to break what was sacred, foreclosing reconciliation with church or guild. Cost is felt in the loss of ancestral identity and the burden of self-authored purpose. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the schism backstory slightly dilutes immediacy of present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “shard of hush”—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the signal originates within the fragment, not the stars. This reversal narrows options: he must listen inward, not outward. Cost is felt in the fragment’s subsiding warmth and his irreversible shift from cosmic to human echoes. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (discarding assumptions, tuning deeper), though pressure remains atmospheric rather than actively obstructed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—merging fractured realities into coherence—is signaled early and deepens when Elijah initiates his “real mission.” Escalation is driven by his agency: tuning frequencies, monitoring strain, guiding fusion. The cost is unmistakable: the grotto nearly tears apart, and Elijah’s positivity falters under pressure. Though stakes are cosmic, they’re viscerally felt through passengers’ gasps and the ferry’s groan. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; success hinges on Elijah’s secret preparation and skill.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering “the texture of connection”—tightens meaningfully when Siran shifts from forcing memories to “letting them breathe,” narrowing his method to chaotic weaving with regret-dyed thread. Agency drives escalation: his choices (precision → abandon) alter tactics under coherent pressure from the gallery’s illusions. Cost is unmistakable—the sinew thread’s destruction and his “chest tight with awe and exhaustion”—and the final corridor collapse reweights the stake as frayed yet alive. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his flawed execution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—teaching celestial navigation in a lightless world—is signaled early and deepens when the projector incorporates the anchor link, making abstraction tangible. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he volunteers, designs the lesson, and activates the simulation. Cost is felt in the students’ posture shift and the unspoken acknowledgment that they may never see real stars. One tightening suffices: the transition from sonar to starlight forecloses old methods permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and deepens when the sister’s institutionalization reframes the photo’s erasure. Aria’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow pulses despite ambiguity. Cost is conceptual (bearing witness to buried trauma) and felt (equipment trembling, emotional weight). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; truth emerges through her method. Tightening occurs at the music box discovery, foreclosing easy assumptions about grief.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“to stand by the unremembered”—is signaled early and deepens through tactile engagement with residual consciousness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Eliza chooses to touch the cable, synchronizing with the system, triggering dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: loss of corporeal self, replacement by “profound stillness that weighed nothing and everything.” Tidal window creates live pressure; phase transition isn’t escape but irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—extracting meaning from catastrophic failure—is signaled early and deepens through Aris’s fragmented transmissions. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elias initiates transmission, taps the shard, interprets ink. Cost is unmistakable: three death certificates, shattered time, tethered existence. While pressure coheres, the tightening lacks a decisive trade-off beyond emotional endurance; the accident’s cause remains abstract, slightly muting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving a dying language through non-verbal means—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes shouting fails but quiet articulation works. The meaningful tightening occurs when they synchronize hand-mapping, internal vibration, and bird choreography—a high-stakes act requiring precision. Cost is visible in the frayed connections, powdered memories, and generational silence. Agency is fully in Kaelen’s hands; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from loss—is signaled early and tightens when the Jester reframes Elias’s sister as “punchline,” forcing a moral recalibration. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his decision to listen, then confront, triggers the climax. Cost is felt in the fizzing anger and relinquished quest object. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening works, though Lyra’s arrival borders on coincidence; her role clarifies stakes but doesn’t intensify Elias’s core dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and deepens when the violinist realizes playing is challenge, not lament. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to play despite statues advancing, pressing the shell to her collarbone as both shield and provocation. Cost is felt—the city halts, glass cracks, her heart hammers—but remains abstract; no personal loss (e.g., broken strings, injury) grounds the price. The living statues’ motion raises pressure credibly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—delivering life-saving hope across a war-torn border—is signaled early and tightens when the drone patrol reaches its zenith, forcing Kael’s three-second window. Agency is clear: he creates absence to enable connection. Cost is felt in his perpetual unhealed wound (“not today”) and the constant risk of detection. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Causal lens, with one meaningful deepening (the tissue sample’s stakes revealed mid-action).

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice/identity—is signaled early and tightens when the halo pulses in rhythm with wind bells, forcing a choice: touch or retreat. Elian’s agency drives escalation; his persistence leads him past dead ends into revelation. Cost is felt in the weight of decades of silence now shattered—a visceral, irreversible shift. The lone flaw: the halo’s mechanics verge on magical convenience, though its emotional function justifies it under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live as entities—is signaled early and deepens when the library’s geometry shifts, forcing the librarian to navigate impossible space. Her agency drives escalation: she reads hyperbolic curves as syntax, lets the scarf guide her, steps through the door. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves behind the patrons’ thin realities, returning forever changed while they remain unaware—a sacrifice of shared understanding for solitary communion with story-life.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the luminous absence—is signaled early and deepens through the sunrise ritual. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the dream responds passively at dawn without resistance or trade-off. The “vitalize” action succeeds effortlessly, removing felt risk. Cost is implied thematically but not dramatized as personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing a joy locked by fear—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s escalating resistance to the fear’s “tide of impossible longing.” The meaningful tightening occurs when he visualizes “enough,” narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is felt in the ribbon’s desaturation and the irreversible release of enveloped secrets. Agency is fully internal but dramatized through voice and focus, not passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen time—tightens when Elara realizes memory loss was protective, not theft. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to study broken constellations (not wait for answers) triggers contact. Cost is conceptual (“protective field weakens”) and tactical (she must now guard thresholds). Coincidence complicates (habit breaks), but resolution stems from her folklorist methodology, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mentoring resilience through reversible exile—is signaled early and tightens when Elara activates the return, risking failure. Escalation is driven by her agency: whispering activation words, handling glass with “combative tenderness.” Cost is unmistakable: twenty years of anxious backward pacing, Marcus’s aged-but-unbroken state, and the shadow’s irreversible fade. The tea-leaf geometry shift confirms pathway stability, making stakes visceral rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving a century-blooming magic against mundanity—is signaled early and deepened through Elianor’s ritual, which narrows options to one fragile act of essence-weaving. The cost is conceptual (the world’s lost wonder) and personal (generational burden), made legible in the seed’s trembling response. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the absence of tangible risk or consequence beyond success slightly softens escalation; nothing is visibly lost even if she failed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped spirits by confronting communal denial—is signaled early and deepens with each knot. Escalation is protagonist-driven: Elias’s needle work intensifies as silence becomes “tangible force.” Cost is felt in accumulated pressure and the villagers’ buried guilt. The fourth knot’s resistance introduces moral complexity (“stitches meant to conceal”), tightening options meaningfully under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reopening the whispered chapel through empathic interpretation of silence—is signaled early and deepens via video comparison. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses playback speed, timestamp alignment, and ritual execution. The cost is conceptual (bearing ancestral knowledge) and atmospheric (terrifying presence), though lacks tangible sacrifice. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from disciplined method under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding how to let go—is signaled early and deepens through each transmission, culminating in the realization that some vanishings offer no chance for release. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses which voices to analyze, and each choice narrows his emotional options. The third transmission’s abrupt void forces the decisive turn. Cost is legible in Elias’s quiet exhaustion and the final act of relinquishing analysis—a foreclosed path with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating the ghost’s transmission before the storm closes the window—is signaled early and tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure. The deepening occurs when the ghost reveals a “way to bridge realms,” raising the stakes from mere translation to world-altering manifestation. Agency is clear: the balladeer chooses speed over caution, risking error for completion. Cost is visible in his frantic precision and the implied exhaustion of repeated ascents, though the price lacks irreversible consequence—no tool lost, no injury sustained—keeping it just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—accessing hidden joy within rigid hierarchy—is signaled early and deepens as diary reveals systemic rebellion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her unfolding of pages actively decrypts truth. Cost is conceptual (accepting complicity in a fragile resistance) and felt (breath fogging in cold). Coincidence (finding goggles) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decryption requires her active manipulation of light.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—validating memory in absence—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s cloud categorization, which shifts from intellectual exercise to emotional reckoning. Pressure tightens as the gondola descends, forcing focus on fleeting signs (the cirrus scar). Cost is conceptual but felt: his entire worldview hinges on proving emptiness has weight. While agency is limited to observation and naming, it’s appropriate for the Situational/Accumulative design, though a more tangible trade-off would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the sky before demolition—is clear by line three and tightens relentlessly as the wrecking ball approaches. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers the coin, unlocks the safe, assembles lenses, and bends light, each act narrowing time and raising stakes. The cost is visceral (raw hands, trembling) and conceptual (abandoning portraiture). Coincidence complicates (demolition timing) but never resolves; victory is earned through craft under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—earning respect through discovery—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the board encodes “stranded luminance.” The starling murmuration acts as a meaningful intensification that reweights his understanding, narrowing his path to revelation. Though coincidence introduces the alignment, it complicates rather than resolves; Elias’s agency in documenting and connecting symbols earns the escalation. Cost is conceptual (solitude transformed into responsibility) but unmistakable in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—repairing time’s fractures—is signaled early and deepens when the mirrors erupt into visions, forcing the locksmith to confront her past. Agency is maintained throughout: she chooses which gears to use, resists flinching, and completes the mechanism. Cost is felt (frozen tears, emotional exposure), though escalation leans more on atmospheric intensification than narrowed options—a slight softness under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming from survivors to stewards—is signaled early and deepens through each chalk-led quest. Agency lies in collective interpretation and action; Kael’s archival insight triggers the turn, and the community’s daily decoding forecloses isolationist survival. Pressure escalates via atmospheric urgency (implied habitability window) and emotional investment in the Gardener’s mission. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: innocence lost, replaced by intergenerational duty, crystallized when children become message-leavers.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning at the end of time—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s deviation from orders. Escalation occurs via his decision to merge the puppet with the pane, transforming delay into legacy. Cost is felt in the irreversible dissolution of the lighthouse and his own erasure, yet the lullaby persists. Though pressure is internal and cosmic, it remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; however, the lack of tangible opposition softens the stakes’ visceral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers from the orchard’s curse—is signaled early and tightens as frost descends and birds circle. Tomas’s agency drives escalation: he assembles, activates, and guides despite personal cost (morning sickness, cursed blood). The mechanical birds’ logic is confounded by his “nearly-living” impressions—a credible complication, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: his humanity erodes even as he preserves another’s life.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling familial love with professional ethics—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes a patent-free variant is possible. The tightening occurs in-scene via her observation of foam dynamics, which shifts her knowledge and narrows her path to synthesis. Cost is felt in her enduring grief and the moral weight of circumventing corporate control, though the absence of tangible consequence (e.g., job risk) slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom from memory via erasure—is signaled early and tightened twice: first with the woman’s incision, then the young man’s, each narrowing Elias’s emotional distance from his work. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; cost is visible in trembling hands and blank stares. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—Elias repeats the same ritual without tactical shift or personal risk, reducing stakes to procedural inevitability rather than deepening crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—relief from unbearable personal guilt—is signaled early and deepens when Kael chooses to subsume collective remorse, narrowing his emotional options permanently. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he reads ripples, descends, and touches the altar. The cost is unmistakable: he trades acute personal agony for diffuse human suffering, altering his very identity as a chef. Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting isolated farming communities through rehabilitated grain elevator talks—is signaled early and deepens through linguistic sequencing and communal response. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Elara programs the broadcast, calibrates resonance, and initiates transmission, culminating in measurable reciprocity (cooperatives, festivals, charter). The cost is conceptual but undeniable: fifteen years of solitary labor, institutional skepticism, and the erosion of cultural memory. Though conflict lacks overt opposition, pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each language layer reweighting the stakes toward unity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—accessing entangled memories to reshape humanity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s neural modifications. Agency is clear (she activates the interface), and cost is conceptual (isolation, evolutionary burden). However, escalation lacks a tangible tightening; the “quaking reverie” intensifies atmosphere but doesn’t narrow options or force a trade-off beyond abstract commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering “seeds of vigilance”—is signaled early and tightens via the temporal constraint (gravity inversion hour), forcing irreversible commitment. Agency is clear: Elara decodes, journeys, harvests. Cost is conceptual (bearing knowledge humanity isn’t ready for) and felt (predawn solitude, stewardship burden). However, opposition is abstract; no secondary pressure tests her resolve, limiting escalation depth despite strong thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving silenced music—is signaled immediately and deepens when Eliara risks failure by using an untested method. The tightening occurs when she presses the insulator to the crack: a point of no return where success or failure becomes imminent. Cost is visible in the song’s fragility (“fleeting,” “soon... fade”) and her gentle lullaby—a renunciation of prolonging the moment. Escalation is driven by her agency, though the opposition (wood’s resistance, time’s passage) remains abstract rather than dynamically pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “eclipsed covenant”—is signaled early and tightens when magnetic shifts threaten to obscure patterns. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his method (“translating silence”) forces a deepening that changes his understanding, not just facts. Cost is felt in the fading hope at sunset and crystallized in his acceptance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through sensory and cosmic intensification rather than causal reversals, satisfying length-appropriate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering the diary to map empathic silences—is signaled early and deepens as time narrows before fireworks. Silen’s agency drives escalation: each frequency attempt reflects a different emotional silence, culminating in the breakthrough tied to “what sound cannot express.” The cost is legible: the moment of understanding coincides with the destruction of the very silence that enabled it. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally felt through embodied choices (trembling hands, chest-resonant hums), satisfying Accumulative lens requirements with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—achieving serenity through cultivating the corpse flower—is signaled early and deepens when community joins the ritual. Pressure tightens meaningfully at bud formation (“I’ve never smelled anything like it”), narrowing focus to the bloom’s paradox. Agency is sustained through Elara’s nightly attention; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in the shift from solitary devotion to shared stewardship—a live trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding the source of resilience—tightens when the arrow tip’s growth-accelerating attribute forces Kael to confront the orchard’s vulnerability. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to extract the artifact, triggering the sapling’s surge and the orchard’s “deafening” response. The cost is conceptual but legible: carrying the artifact risks repeating past violence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the “rogue catalyst” backstory remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the cause of mass silencing—is signaled early and tightens when Elias identifies the fuel additive. His agency drives escalation: survey → sensor placement → soil sampling → discovery of dispersal mechanism. The cost is conceptual but legible: expertise failed to prevent a weaponized convergence. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, though the “deliberate” turn leans slightly on inference over dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“certify wonder as essential”) is signaled early and deepens via the amber sheet’s activation, narrowing options to a single, fragile moment of convergence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—their voice modulates to match auroral pulses—and cost is visible in the sheet’s exhaustion and the irreversible awakening of the cavern. However, opposition is environmental rather than interpersonal or internal, softening tension; stakes feel elevated but untested by failure or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency through confronting failure—is signaled early and tightens when the Keeper chooses to uncase the flute, risking total collapse. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each note thins the veil, deepening knowledge at increasing emotional cost. The tightening forecloses permanent defeat, replacing it with transformative understanding. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens when Silas realizes empathy requires surrender, not calculation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he presses the fragment to his chest, dissolving his borrowed selves; this forecloses his old method with visible cost (loss of protective personas). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each star’s vanishing intensifies pressure, culminating in collective arrival. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the dozen others emerge as consequence of his earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—carrying legacy through wonder-weaving—is signaled early and deepens when the storm forces shelter, enabling the hermit encounter. The courier’s agency drives escalation: his choice to engage, not luck, extends the moment. Cost is felt in the dawn departure (hermit vanishes) and transformed self-perception. Could tighten further with a tangible loss (e.g., damaged artifact), but thematic cost suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual’s intensifying focus. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the method, raises the prism, closes his eyes, presses his forehead—all narrowing options toward communion. The cost is felt in the solitude of aftermath: proof exists only in his bones, irreducible to external validation. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered (“hollow ache,” “sharp pang”), and the final renunciation of empirical proof for private certainty forecloses a path with quiet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and deepens through sacrificial weaving. Pressure escalates via physical cost (bleeding hands) and existential risk (being pulled into the void). Agency is clear: Elara chooses to recommence, trusting unseen connections. The tightening occurs when she weaves “wait,” narrowing options to endless labor. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her effort alone bridges realms.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s bartered awakening. Agency is clear: he chooses risk (spending wages), secrecy (false-bottomed crates), and public exposure (releasing the arch at dawn). Cost is felt (kneeling in exhaustion) and visible (the arch’s smaller size). One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragments lift—a narrowing from hope to proof—but escalation leans slightly more on texture than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled immediately and tightens when Kael witnesses his younger self being scapegoated. His agency drives escalation: he actively redirects causality via the datapad, incurring physical agony and temporal dislocation. Cost is unmistakable (“like being unstitched”) and alters his reality, though the stakes remain narrowly personal rather than expanding under pressure, limiting the band slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving fragile safety through silent connection—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp fails, forcing Jonah to act not just mechanically but emotionally. His agency is expressed through ritual (stacking stones, leaving glass), which narrows his options to nonverbal dialogue, carrying the cost of perpetual uncertainty about the sender’s identity. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice (relighting the lamp, placing the token), not coincidence, though the “ghostly” presence borders on convenient mysticism. Still, the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the final stone triangle marking a decisive stance: “I am here, too.”

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving human agency while subtly guiding it—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s nightly adjustments. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses not to change predicted headlines but to “add nuance,” accepting the cost of invisibility. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation leans more on textual density than rising opposition. No antagonist exists, but the erosion of the physical world provides sufficient situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some lives magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s methodical sun-tracking, which narrows his focus from abstract inquiry to embodied practice. The escalation is driven by his agency: he chooses daily observation, culminating in the teapot alignment. Cost is legible in the quiet renunciation of donor-mystery and the commitment to become a “prism”—a visible trade of passive curiosity for active devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding trees’ witnessing—is signaled early and deepens through dream-mapping and sextant repair. Pressure tightens when storm and moonlight converge, forcing Elian to act at the tower. Agency is clear: their adjustments cause the vision. Cost is felt—not material loss, but irreversible knowledge that burdens future maintenance. Coincidence (pin sound) complicates but doesn’t resolve; it triggers a device Elian repaired, linking cause to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the realm through song—is signaled early and tightens when the keeper risks playing again after past failure. The escalation is driven by his agency: plucking strings, joining voice, pressing light to the window. Cost is legible in his hitched breath, trembling hands, and chest ache. Though stakes remain somewhat abstract (“dying realm”), they’re viscerally felt through townsfolk’s softened shadows and tentative harmonies.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to protect herself or serve others through presence—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: her “hide ritual” narrows options, making attendance a true sacrifice. The tightening occurs when she secures her journal, foreclosing emotional safety. Cost is unmistakable: she trades tranquility for connection, and the library’s silence for collective consciousness. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming beauty amid loss—is signaled early and deepens when the baker reveals his withdrawal wasn’t disappearance but surrender. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she plants seeds before meeting him, then offers bread after revelation. Cost is felt in the vanished bakery’s absence and the winter ahead, yet the loaf’s warmth enables a trade-off between memory and action. Coincidence (his arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to keep planting earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—saving luminous vows from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as luminosity decreases and the Great Forgetting approaches. Elara’s agency is active: she adjusts sensitivity, records data, and places the slide in the chamber. The escalation is driven by her choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. Cost is felt: exhaustion, irreversible fading, and the quiet sacrifice of ephemeral beauty for archival permanence. One tightening suffices, though deeper moral friction would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—exposing betrayal before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens credibly through Emmie’s failed attempts. Each reversal (discovery by Silas, recognition by guard) forces tactical adaptation, culminating in a diversion that succeeds. Cost is legible: time lost, trust eroded, and the moral burden of holding damning evidence. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the federal agent remains off-page, slightly weakening antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why humans carry weather—is signaled early and deepens into a need for belonging. The tightening occurs when the ring activates, forcing Elara to choose between continued isolation and vulnerable pursuit. Cost is felt in her cracked skepticism and irreversible integration into a network she once doubted. Though the male character appears via coincidence, his presence doesn’t resolve but reveals; agency lies in Elara’s choice to stay luminous. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via escalating sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed creativity—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of the box and the act of drawing. Pressure escalates via internal resistance (“laughter had been cruel”) and physical hesitation (trembling fingers), culminating in cathartic release. The tightening occurs when he chooses to open the painting, foreclosing continued exile. Cost is felt (years lost, emotional weight) but could be sharper—no tangible sacrifice beyond emotional labor, which slightly softens the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes officials lied about water. Her agency drives escalation: piecing the map, confronting Marius, broadcasting truths. Cost is visible in permanent wilting and societal trauma. However, the council’s off-page role slightly softens opposition pressure; escalation leans more on discovery than active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and tightens when the iceberg begins to melt *from vibration*, not heat, proving truth must be released through art, not preserved intact. The tuner’s agency drives escalation: his lever adjustment triggers the prism, which catalyzes the melt. Cost is visible—the fragment vanishes—and conceptual: wonder endures only by being relinquished. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical trade-off (e.g., sacrificing another sculpture) would push this into 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from magnetic/static corruption—is signaled early and deepens through the android’s realization that escape requires internal sacrifice, not physical flight. The tightening occurs when L-734 chooses to miniaturize fear rather than discard it, narrowing options to one precise, high-cost act. Agency drives escalation: every micro-choice (pausing, retrieving, compressing) compounds pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: the combustion consumes memory, identity fragments, and the original roses—yet yields transformed life, making stakes viscerally felt without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost stories to heal community—is signaled early and deepens via neighborhood tales. Pressure accumulates texturally: each anecdote tightens the pattern, culminating in the archive. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing; clues appear conveniently (loose brick, waiting key). The cost—Mrs. Leclair’s vanished presence—is felt but off-stage; Elias pays no personal price, weakening stakes. Coincidence complicates (mailbox shakes mysteriously) but also resolves (locket opens just in time), softening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing the mentor—is clear early and escalates via the spider-web timer. Elara’s agency drives every turn: her dance, journal cross-referencing, and dice interpretation directly enable liberation. Cost is felt in time pressure and guard intrusion, though their mesmerization slightly softens opposition. Escalation follows a clean causal arc under a Causal lens, with one meaningful tightening (countdown reaching completion).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memories—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s nightly ritual and institute infiltration. The deepening occurs when coffee grounds map gravitational folds, transforming passive longing into active retrieval. Cost is felt: physical risk (nearly tripping), emotional vulnerability (tear at first memory), and temporal sacrifice (all-night vigil). Agency drives escalation; coincidence (whale beaching) catalyzes but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—silencing a prophecy that weaponizes sound—is signaled early and tightens when the summoner realizes he must “out-silence” it. His agency drives escalation: mapping silence, crafting the crane, pressing his thumb to collapse it. The cost is conceptual (the prophecy’s dissolution) and environmental (the brook’s tamed edge), though the personal toll remains under-realized.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting vs. sharing the building’s language—is signaled early and tightens when Elias demands the seal’s origin. The tutor’s agency drives escalation: her admission “I’m listening” forces Elias’s stance shift from interrogation to reception. Cost is visible: her solitude ends, his certainty fractures. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density (meteors, whispers) rather than causal turns, satisfying the single-meaningful-tightening default for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—integrating quarantined memories—is signaled early and tightens when the shell warns they’re “bleeding through.” Elena’s agency drives escalation: she builds a resonance grid, retrieves memories, and endures their weight. Cost is felt in each fragment’s sorrow and the garden’s trembling participation. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—justice through calibrated treason—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara chooses creation over destruction. Agency is clear: she actively forges, seals, and delivers the document. Cost is felt (years of isolation, physical pain) and alters tactics (using mother’s ring for seal, blood for authenticity). Escalation reads as protagonist-driven under Causal lens, though the solicitor’s role slightly softens external pressure; still, stakes remain viscerally personal and coherently pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing the Chancellor’s web—is signaled early and tightens when engineers’ silenced reports surface via echo. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: his singing forces the city to hear, triggering the Spire’s tremor. Cost is unmistakable: structural collapse, social panic, personal burden. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sung layer intensifies consequence without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing buried truths—is signaled early and deepens when dreams turn frantic. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to interpret Nikolaus’s message and implants it in the director’s mind. The cost (spiritual exhaustion, emotional toll of handling grief) is felt but not overstated. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; corporate malfeasance is revealed through her active intervention. One meaningful deepening (ghost-ship vision) narrows options to truth-telling or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepens when the loom mirrors her nets, reweighting her daily labor. Pressure escalates texturally: fireflies intensify, paths sharpen, setting grows more intimate. Though coincidence (fireflies guiding her) complicates, resolution stems from her agency—whistling, following, offering the whisk. Cost is subtle but present: the night ends, fireflies disperse, dawn erases the paths—knowledge gained at the price of transience.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. convenient lies—tightens meaningfully when shredded letters reveal OmniGen’s weaponization plot, foreclosing Maya’s debunking path. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency (reassembly work), not coincidence. Cost is felt in her irreversible shift from skeptic to witness. However, external opposition is off-stage; stakes remain largely intellectual rather than viscerally immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn without rejecting shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the radio warns “The observatory will fall, or the prophet shall.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he subtly alters frequencies, forcing Maren’s followers to disperse. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices both allegiances for a third path, leaving his sanctuary. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern density (prophecies, static, circles) culminating in decisive reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving fleeting beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the music box raises the stakes from ambient sounds to endangered human artifacts. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to seal the jar, seek relics, reinterpret purpose. Cost is felt (emotional labor, solitude) and visible in transformed tactics. Coincidence (elderly woman’s visit) complicates but doesn’t resolve; redemption emerges from sustained effort. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the external pressure remains light for elite-tier conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the artifact from human greed—is signaled early and tightens as hostile intent “clings like a second skin.” The engineer’s agency drives escalation: he chooses resonance over force, aligning his frequency to enact absolution. Cost is legible: eternal vigilance, isolation, and the burden of sonic guardianship. Though the threat remains abstract (no on-page antagonists), the deepening—ice releasing sorrows—narrows options to this singular, costly ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—initiating a patient revolution—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s accumulating data and trembling anticipation. The tightening occurs when she identifies the complete celestial pattern, narrowing her window to act. Cost is conceptual but legible: she foregoes immediate impact for generational change, accepting obscurity and solitude. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via cadence and detail rather than external opposition, which suits the piece—but the lack of tangible resistance slightly softens the stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her story from paternal control—is signaled early and deepens with the discovery of parallels between her father’s and the victim’s deaths. The tightening occurs when Elara reads the inscription, shifting from investigator to seeker of personal truth. Yet escalation relies heavily on internal realization rather than external pressure or choice with visible cost; the “storm inside her” ends too neatly without concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing posthumous desecration of Eleanor’s memory—is signaled early and intensifies through one meaningful deepening: Anja’s revelation transforms the heart from apology to weapon. Pressure coheres causally; coincidence doesn’t resolve (Anja’s expertise is established, not lucky). Elias’s agency drives escalation: his choice to seek Anja and then accept her intervention forecloses passive complicity. Cost is legible—his shattered trust and moral burden—but the tightening lacks a second concrete trade-off (e.g., time pressure, personal risk), slightly limiting escalation depth for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ringing the Silent Bell—is signaled early and deepens via the arrow’s transliteration, which reweights knowledge and narrows access to a hidden chamber. Escalation is driven by Zephyr’s agency: choosing to use the kaleidoscope, interpreting resonance, descending into eroded zones. Cost is felt in the workshop’s trembling structure and the overseer’s fear (“even the First Makers feared”). One meaningful tightening suffices, and it delivers under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. enforced silence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elias shifts from curator to avenger. Escalation is driven by his agency: fabricating the audit forces Thorne’s hand, revealing the ghost node. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits safety and neutrality, embracing exposure. The “revolution” isn’t abstract—it’s tied to renewable energy destabilization, making stakes viscerally political without telescoping.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance before the “weighted breath” expires—is signaled early and tightens through each mirror reflection, narrowing options until only the child’s pivotal choice remains. Agency is clear: Shael selects visions to rebuild empathy, culminating in pressing fragments to the third mirror. Cost is felt (“personal cost each vision inevitably demanded”) and visible in the breath held too long. Coincidence never resolves; escalation stems from protagonist’s intuitive calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of approaching endings—is signaled early and deepens through immersion in disaster. The tightening occurs when Arthur abandons euthanasia tourism for relief work, narrowing his path from passive spectatorship to engaged witness. Cost is legible: he surrenders the fantasy of neat finality, accepting messy continuity. Agency is subtle but present—his choice to stay, to listen, to keep the parasol—and the shanty moment crystallizes stance without external resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering lost connection—is signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. The sentinel acts, yet Lila and Marc remain passive recipients of fate’s nudge. No meaningful trade-off or foreclosed path emerges; their reconciliation incurs no visible cost. Coincidence (the letter fragment) complicates and resolves, violating the “luck may complicate but not solve” principle under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when the voice demands truth within words. The walker’s agency drives escalation: first consecration, then second act for silence. Cost is felt in the parapet’s last energy surge and the abandoned mask. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the tightening isn’t causal but textural, culminating in a reconfigured understanding of what must be saved.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting pain into collective healing—is signaled early and deepens as arcs merge under Elias’s agency. The escalation hinges on his photographic method, culminating in a pattern that reconfigures sorrow as resilience. Cost is felt in the relinquished secrecy of the map case and the irreversible shift from solitary archivist to witness of shared grace. No coincidence resolves pressure; every arc is earned through layered attention.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding language’s end—is signaled early and deepens when “Silence” triggers overwhelming auditory collapse, narrowing options from analysis to acceptance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his word choices), and cost is unmistakable: the realization that growth was always decay. Under the Accumulative lens, the cascade of sounds reweights the stake with emotional and conceptual price. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second micro-turn could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the ineffable sound of aging—is signaled early and intensifies through Elias’s escalating desperation (forgetting purpose, clinging to chalk). Pressure tightens via his cognitive limitation: each future glimpse dissolves, forcing reliance on physical markers (chalk X, arranged splinters), which narrows options to ritualized gesture. The deepening occurs at the monolith, where vibration becomes tangible, raising the cost: he must accept transience (chalk on rust) rather than secure permanence. Agency is clear—his hand moves “on instincts he couldn’t explain”—and the price (ephemeral record) is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival via orbital stabilization—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes the clock is a symptom. Agency is clear: he chooses to redirect chaos, not suppress it. Cost is felt in bodily collapse and the irreversible transmutation of timekeeping into propulsion. Escalation follows causal logic under pressure, though the leaf method borders on mystical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing an unfinished farewell—is signaled early and deepens when the broken record reveals Mr. Hale’s regret. Elijah’s agency drives escalation: he chooses violin over guitar, retrieves the box, and symbolically reunifies the record. Cost is felt in Mr. Hale’s emotional surrender (“Thank you… For this”) and the irreversible nature of the gesture. However, the “blood work” clock creates declared urgency that never tightens options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightens when the star chart glitches, feeding the shadow’s strength. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she corrects orbits, forces alignment, seals loops. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, the entity’s near-victory, and the realization that one loop closed doesn’t heal the world. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, though the shadow’s sudden sentience borders on convenient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating fractures between worlds—is signaled early via the tooth and deepens when Eleanor detects “Manacles of starlight.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to return the tooth, foreclosing her prior mode of detached observation in favor of participatory balance. Cost is felt in the loss of the tooth and the irreversible expansion of her worldview. Though the child initiates the crisis, Eleanor’s agency drives escalation: her decision to visit Merrick’s estate and then relinquish the tooth stems from her established trait of “forgiving skepticism.”

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sharing starlight without fire—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s methodical polishing, which narrows her options to patience over spectacle. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses presence over brilliance, crystallizing her stance. Cost is felt in the “tedious” labor and emotional vulnerability of offering a fragile, flameless glow. Though pressure is internal and lyrical, it coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each rotation of the glass raising the stakes of authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protection from public judgment—is signaled early and tightens when Maya recognizes Elara, threatening sanctuary. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unclasp and proffer the pendant, a high-stakes act of trust that forecloses isolation. Cost is felt in her shaky exhale and trembling hand. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via layered silence, shared exposure, and the fragile intimacy of two viralized survivors—a single, meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—creative renewal through bearing witness—is signaled early and deepens via each solemnization. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his attention literally preserves hopes, narrowing his path from desperation to sacred duty. Cost is felt (exhaustion, doubt) and conceptual (writing as extraction, not invention). The “against the current” motif shapes tactics but remains more poetic than causal; tighter linkage to physical resistance would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost ancestral practices—is signaled early and intensified by the harvest moon’s alignment. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his song awakens the cricket, which then sings the forgotten melody, triggering the vine’s bloom. Cost is felt (emotional exhaustion, years of labor) but remains abstract; no tangible sacrifice (e.g., loss of tool, time, or self) alters tactics. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than narrowing options causally.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral life-rhythms against cosmic entropy—is signaled early and tightens when starlight must be poured before the alignment ends. Agency lies in Kaelen’s meticulous choices: selecting resonant objects, positioning glass, tipping the plate. The world’s suspended breath creates a live clock that pressures tactics without resolving conflict; success depends on his skill, not luck. Cost is visible in the resin seal: knowledge preserved, but only by accepting that future generations will need it—implying cycles of loss. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral wonder—is signaled early and deepens as echoes fade during the “wounded season.” Pressure escalates texturally: from observation to calibration to activation, each phase narrowing Elian’s window of opportunity. The climax hinges on his agency—precise timing, calibrated components—not luck. Cost is conceptual (imagination’s erosion) and felt in the cellar of reason, though a more tangible sacrifice (e.g., personal memory traded) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting burdens through self-calcification—is signaled early and escalates via the precise alignment of starlight, which narrows options to a single irreversible act. Agency is clear: Elara arranges her body in “impossible geometries” and places the lamp at the fulcrum. Cost is legible: 4,817 burdens recorded on her stone surface, boundary-less entrapment until snowmelt. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the escalation hinges more on cosmic timing than active struggle, slightly muting tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into form—is signaled early and deepens when the kettle whistles, forcing a pause that heightens focus on what’s being “contained.” Agency is clear: Elara chooses disciplined creation over dissolution, foreclosing passive mourning with felt cost (months of solitude, raw material of sorrow). Pressure accumulates texturally—rain, wood grain, memory—not through external conflict, fitting the lens. Coincidence never resolves; every insight stems from her hands’ labor.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping the ghost of eroded ambition—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes stories are for himself, not the ghost. This deepening narrows his options: he must either keep bartering or accept authorship. Cost is felt in the wheel’s disintegration and the relinquishing of old regrets. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the turn lacks a sharper tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting hope through engineering—is signaled early and tightens when the first valve groans open, narrowing options to physical intervention. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her hands carve channels, align tools), with visible cost: smudged grease, rust-laden water, and the emotional weight of “forgotten dreams.” Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening occurs via pattern resolution (water revealing equations), though the absence of external opposition softens pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned music—is signaled early and deepens when droplets become an “orchestra of possibility.” Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen, then hum, then touch the crystal. Cost is felt (“weight…as a burden” vs. “old friend”) and visible in his weathered body. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory density, not external conflict, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses regret without reversing life choices.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding how lies scaffold dreams—is signaled early and deepens when the chest reveals schematics, not jewels. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to interpret rather than discard, transforming salvage into revelation. Cost is felt in the “serene upheaval” of his worldview; the bridge he sought was never stone but story. Coincidence plays no role—every turn stems from his trained instincts and prior obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to the weavers’ encoded history—is signaled early and deepens when the rope reveals “lightning’s gift,” linking to the fulgurite. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his coaxing elicits the weaver’s appearance and the rope’s transformation. Cost is felt in the fulgurite’s cooling—a symbolic relinquishment of power—and the weight of memory etched “like scars.” No false resolution; the weavers remain enigmatic, and Elias departs unchanged except in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding how love persists through absence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to write the gardener’s living obituary. The tightening occurs in his decision to stay past the ship’s departure, foreclosing escape and committing to witness. Cost is felt in his loneliness and the unspoken acknowledgment that he, too, is adrift. Though pressure is internal and atmospheric rather than external, it coheres under the Accumulative lens and escalates through sensory and symbolic density.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a dead world—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the egg is a seed, not a relic. His agency drives escalation: assembling the device triggers the palace’s “scream,” and his choice to proceed despite groaning anchors forecloses survival. The cost—his life and the kingdom’s destruction—is unmistakable in the plummeting palace and final breath. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens, though the machines’ sentience slightly edges into metaphor rather than tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving destruction isn’t final—is signaled early and deepened through the act of grafting life onto scorched earth. Pressure escalates texturally: from memory of fire to physical planting, culminating in the tying of the red thread, which forecloses passive inheritance in favor of active compassion. Cost is felt conceptually (bearing invisible scars) and visually (the lone sapling against vast emptiness). Though no external antagonist exists, the internalized legacy provides coherent opposition, and the tightening is driven by Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens as each breadcrumb intensifies Kael’s emotional investment and the box’s weight. The meaningful tightening occurs at the silver coin, where memory returns with “sharp ache,” raising the personal cost. Agency is maintained throughout: Kael chooses to listen, to follow ripples, to touch the key. Time (geese migration) adds gentle pressure, though it doesn’t force hard tactical shifts—hence just below 8.8. Cost is felt in relinquishment: he leaves the box behind, accepting that liberation requires release.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving organic chaos against mechanical stillness—is signaled early and tightens when the gear’s rotation “accelerating, whispering of infinities.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the garden’s center: destroying the gear violates the vow, so integration becomes the only path. Cost is felt in “joy and loss” and the new order’s “less forgiving” nature. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency, though the sonar’s origin lacks causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s shift from naming the dead to mapping their sorrow. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to carve the migration path, foreclosing conventional memorialization. Cost is felt in the solitude of his labor and the relinquishment of control over how families will interpret his work.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance after fracturing it—is signaled early and tightens when Elias presses the inscribed handle into the mechanism, trading grand gestures for microscopic devotion. Escalation is Accumulative: each carved symbol (lost toy, lover’s smile) deepens the weight of his penance. Cost is unmistakable: lifelong shame transformed into physical labor, the irreversible social rupture of the festival. Agency drives the turn—his secret method reweights time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving echo integrity against unraveling—is signaled early and escalates via the fraying border, which narrows Elias’s options to immediate, precise intervention. The tightening occurs when he isolates Foster’s thread, foreclosing delay. Cost is felt in temporal urgency (“chess clock runs down”) and emotional weight (“whispers—not words, but emotions”). Agency is clear: decoding is his method, not luck. However, escalation lacks a second meaningful pressure point; one deepening suffices but doesn’t push into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—shaping the future through constrained innovation—is signaled early and deepens via the act of writing. The meaningful tightening occurs when the quill touches the page: each stroke “suggests” rather than dictates, narrowing certainty into possibility. Cost is visible in the abandoned quill and widened fissure in the ice—consequences of creation. Agency is consistent, though escalation leans textual rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving stories in a famine-struck world—is signaled early and tightens when the broadcast issues a clear instruction, forcing Elias to act rather than merely preserve. His agency drives escalation: transcribing → following lyrics → touching crystal → singing in the pit. Cost is legible at closure: the broadcast’s voice is gone, the crystal dimmed—a trade of lifeline for legacy. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; each intensification (brighter dial, coalescing lyrics) reweights the possibility of renewal without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—crystallizing impermanence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses gathering over scattering. The meaningful tightening occurs at the powdering: ash from his last drawing binds shards, transforming pain into fragile permanence. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is felt in the fallen shard and dissolved mirage—safety is lost, but purpose is gained. One tightening suffices for this length, and it’s executed with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving counter-narratives against state erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the cog disproves founding myths. Sebastian’s agency drives escalation: mapping sewers, decoding sediment, risking flood to save charts. The tightening occurs at the sealed chamber discovery, which narrows his path to exposure or silence. Cost is felt in constant vigilance and physical peril, though the tremors slightly edge toward external complication rather than purely protagonist-driven pressure. Still, his choice to ascend with truth crystallizes stance under coherent, accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts as social glue—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanor confronts administrative dismissal. Her agency (“subtracting noise” from rehearsals) forces a trade-off: emotional labor over institutional support. Cost is legible in her “resignation” and the fragility of student unity—no guarantee it lasts beyond rehearsal. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a broken world—is signaled early and tightens when Elias fears the log will be “technical, cold, and devoid of feeling.” His agency drives the escalation: he ascends, solves the riddle, retrieves the poem, and chooses to give it away. The cost is felt: he parts with his last secret, his mother’s box, and his role as sole keeper of memory. Coincidence (the open panel) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution stems from his consistent values.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating whether houses possess consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when the shard amplifies perception. Elias’s agency drives escalation: observation becomes intervention via displacement. The tightening occurs when the shard’s touch unleashes “cosmic pressure,” forcing him to act before the moment passes. Cost is subtle but present: his truth remains private, legible only to the attentive, foreclosing public recognition—a quiet sacrifice fitting the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving certainty vs. embracing nuanced attention—is signaled early and deepens when the ampoule arrives. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses vulnerability (threading consciousness through crack) and initiates dialogue (striking chime), narrowing options from silent vigil to reciprocal exchange. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: his eternal solitude ends, replaced by mutual risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of revelation intensifies until stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping the loop by capturing the texture of regret—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s mathematical rebellion. Pressure escalates texturally: equations multiply, air vibrates, steps crumble. Agency is clear—his proofs drive the rupture—and cost is visible (the staircase’s collapse, the die’s split). However, the “mathematical proofs” method remains abstract; their mechanics don’t concretely shape tactics beyond “writing,” slightly blunting escalation’s causality under an otherwise strong Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating ephemeral kindness—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from action to translation. The meaningful tightening occurs in her realization that memory persists beneath “volume of days,” forcing her to refine her method. Cost is visible: the leaf’s transience mirrors her insomnia’s toll, yet she chooses hope anyway. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Minor deduction: the old man’s memory feels slightly convenient, though his emotional warmth is credibly restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity through dying arts—is signaled early and deepens when the Lamentations fresco border vanishes overnight. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the baking ritual, shapes the fresco’s initial, and articulates the moral calculus of mourning art as kin. Cost is unmistakable in the blackened “L” loaf and communal silence—a tangible forfeiture of heritage that reweights every future act of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rewriting fate via temporal mastery—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the maker realizes ascent, not descent, is the trick. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his choice to lift the yoyo triggers the stone’s radiance and subsequent unraveling. Cost is unmistakable: his physical dissolution and erasure from history. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail (humming yoyo, stuttering lighthouse) deepening the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with death’s lingering presence—is signaled early and tightens when the advisor demands unbosoming. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing the path of failed resuscitation is a high-cost renunciation of survival instinct. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off: accept liminality to gain control. Cost is unmistakable—the self is irrevocably split and reassembled as witness-artificer.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming chaos into harmony—is signaled early and deepens through the “dubbing process” and storm-harvested wind harp. Pressure escalates texturally: more objects join, layers thicken, fractal patterns intensify. Though no external antagonist exists, the ocean’s indifference and the orchard’s fragility create coherent situational pressure. Cost is conceptual (loneliness reborn as rhythm) but unmistakable; however, escalation relies on accumulation rather than protagonist-driven tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with her father/understanding the gate—is signaled early and tightens when the crack reveals his message, foreclosing physical reunion but enabling communication. Agency is clear: Elara’s decoding drives escalation. Cost is felt in her isolation (“neighbors alarmed”) and the city’s denial. Pressure coheres causally; coincidence never resolves. One tightening suffices, though a second trade-off (e.g., sacrificing social standing) would push to 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. noble lie—is signaled early and tightens when Elias confronts the master, forcing a trade-off between peace and honesty. The deepening occurs via Elias’s notebook parallels, which crystallize the societal cost. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his recapture attempt provokes the master’s intervention. Cost is conceptual (risking social unraveling) and felt (physical struggle, emotional strain), though the master’s collapse slightly undercuts sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving submerged history—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s ritual of note-placing, which forecloses easier documentation methods in favor of physical, fragile markers. Pressure escalates via the ticking drawbridge clock, forcing prioritization (he chooses the architect’s acoustic note over others). Cost is felt in “wrest history from oblivion’s grasp”—a phrase that crystallizes his lonely, Sisyphean labor. Agency is clear: every placement is a deliberate act of resistance against erasure, though the conflict remains internalized rather than tested by external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—verifying textual origins—is signaled early and deepens when Elias abandons assumed chronology for engineering logic. The blackout isn’t just ambiance; it forces candlelit focus that enables discovery, making time a live constraint. Agency is intellectual but real: his hypothesis, testing, and indexing choices narrow interpretive paths with visible cost (diminishing light, isolation). The final realization forecloses centuries of scholarly error—a conceptual price paid through sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (capturing Liora’s last dream to reassemble her) tightens through each crane-polishing beat. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing which dream fragment to etch next, pressing laughter into quartz. Cost is unmistakable—“grief was no longer wild… it was precision and pain.” The deepening (seventeen cranes, still incomplete) narrows hope without resolving it, intensifying under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing pools of unspent potential—is signaled early and deepens when Elias discovers these form at sites of sudden tragedy. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for data but initiates scans, interprets patterns, and chooses new coordinates. The cost is legible: he trades human connection for metaphysical hunting, epitomized by targeting a classroom massacre site. Pressure tightens via system failures and emotional triggers, culminating in a stance that forecloses personal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding the “frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and deepens when the drone breaches the energy field, shifting from data retrieval to interspecies communion. Kai’s agency drives escalation: overriding controls based on resonance, not external orders. Cost is felt in the irreversible expansion of knowledge (“instruction manual for belonging”) and the dawn return implying lifelong commitment. Yet the barrier encounter resolves too smoothly—minimal tactical consequence weakens pressure’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—confronting the cost of manufactured memories—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals she knows Elias altered her brother’s past. The escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: his confession forces Mara’s measured response and shared departure. Cost is felt in the “flat and brittle” marriage and the brother’s suicide, though the latter occurs off-page. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from withheld silence to shared movement constitutes sufficient tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—peace through symbolic exchange—is signaled early and deepens when apology precedes retrieval. Julian’s agency drives escalation: his moon-phase method creates mutual vulnerability, and his choice to prioritize “untethering hatred” over mere extraction raises emotional stakes. Cost is legible in his lingering trauma and the fragility of the truce. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it’s earned through protagonist-led design.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with her navigational identity—is signaled early and tightens when drifting reveals subconscious sabotage. The meaningful deepening occurs when the compass needle points inward, transforming the conflict from external navigation to internal realignment. Cost is felt in her exhaustion and the irreversible loss of seven lives (including her apprentice), which forecloses a return to her former self. Agency drives escalation: her choice to consult the compass—not coincidence—triggers the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming empathy—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the newspaper message forces immersion. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to read, to enter, to submerge. The cost is visceral (cold, drowning) and conceptual (accepting that healing requires pain). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the time traveler’s role remains ambiguous but doesn’t solve the core conflict—Elias must act alone.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming love beyond death—is signaled early via the cookie fortune and tightens decisively when Elara chooses metamorphosis over static mourning. Agency drives escalation: her reluctant determination ignites the ritual, narrowing options from “summon” to “become.” Cost is unmistakable: surrender of human form for ambiguous coexistence. Coincidence (phoenix rising) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real pressure stems from her internal conflict between desire and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the cartomancer realizes time transforms rather than accumulates. The meaningful tightening occurs when she unfastens dimensional seals, risking dissolution for answers. Cost is unmistakable: she must endure the “weight of all those perfect moments” without being crushed. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. Yet the stakes remain internalized, lacking a tangible trade-off beyond emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—opening the dimension for renewal—is signaled early and deepens through shadow work’s psychological toll. Each stitch forces confrontation with inner darkness, narrowing Elara’s emotional bandwidth and increasing physical weight. The escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under an Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her fading joy and enduring isolation, though the external consequences remain conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the bottle breaks, forcing Elias into unplanned action. His agency drives escalation: he follows, digs, inspects. Coincidence complicates (the escape) but doesn’t resolve; discovery results from his choice to pursue. Cost is subtle but legible: loss of a bug (temporarily), physical effort, and the irony that understanding arrives through accident, not design—aligning with his self-concept yet undermining control.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the fort’s integrity—is signaled early and deepens when Elena learns the blackout masks corruption. The meaningful tightening occurs at the hidden panel: her choice to enter forecloses blind obedience. Cost is felt as moral disorientation (“considering whether her loyalty lay with the commanders or with the truth”). Escalation is driven by Elena’s agency (deciphering, aligning, descending), not coincidence, though the engineers’ sudden presence slightly softens the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns to restore control—is signaled early and deepens when the herder realizes friction is invisible, not gone. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to become part of the geometry, pressing palms into glowing dust. Cost is unmistakable: last month’s bluff collapse haunts her, and the borrowed dawn of realization is explicitly temporary. The tightening forecloses passive observation, demanding bodily sacrifice to conduct energy—a trade-off that reweights her entire approach.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defying censorship by reviving silenced words—is signaled early and deepens when the poet opens the envelope, transforming vigil into vocation. Pressure escalates texturally: storm intensifies as resolve solidifies, culminating in the timer’s end marking release. The cost is felt (years of silence, reopened wounds) and visible in trembling hands and smudged ink. Yet the escalation hinges on internal realization rather than external pressure or tactical shift, limiting causal tightening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming discord into understanding through dialectical fencing—is signaled early and deepens as coded angles shift with the sun. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he aligns the needle card, interprets the windmill as “illusion of progress,” forcing Lyra to counter. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of victory for synthesis, visible when both relax their stances. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each verbal parry narrowing the space between opposition and unity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving censored knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when authorities threaten dismantling, forcing escalation from sanctuary to networked resistance. Protagonist agency drives deepening: Elias’s seed-planting evolves into encrypted coordination. Cost is felt in exhaustion (“victory and exhaustion”) and constant rebuilding. Coincidence (guards relenting) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from prior choices (tin’s false bottom).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rewriting time to heal regret—is signaled early and deepens through the pianist’s agency: he doesn’t wait for magic but engineers it via film and projector. The tightening occurs when he aligns the images with the broken clock, narrowing options to one precise act. Cost is felt in his “steely longing” and physical effort; the arbor’s energies demand exactitude. Coincidence never resolves—every escalation stems from his creatively constrained choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the monsoon—tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure. The deepening occurs when Elias interprets the “clumsiness” in the dream as the key flaw, narrowing his approach. Cost is felt (time running out, elders’ failing minds) and visible in the wind’s “sharp scent” post-success. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating regret after severance—is signaled early and tightens when Kenji admits he “couldn’t shape the words” for Aiko. The deepening occurs as he applies bonsai logic to memory (“trim what is unhealthy, but never destroy”), narrowing his path from passive sorrow to active acknowledgment. Agency is present in his spoken “I regret,” a renunciation that forecloses silence. Cost is felt in cerulean regret, though it doesn’t yet alter external reality—appropriate for this length.
