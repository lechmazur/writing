  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake (survival/meaning from the ledger) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara moves from holding the ledger to deciding its future use, but no on-page cost accompanies the choice—no social risk, tactical loss, or immediate consequence dramatized. The frost offers method, not opposition. Agency at closure is declaration of intent, not a decision that forecloses a live path with felt price. No reversal or escalation tests her commitment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating suffocating silence into witnessed music—is signaled early and tightens when Liam's arrival forces Elara to extend her solitary method to another. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: her gesture toward the glass is an active choice to share her vulnerability, and his response (palm on glass, magenta eruption) raises the cost by exposing his raw anguish. The resolution is earned by Elara's agency (striking the fork, weaving calm), and the cost is visible: they accept permanent silence rather than seeking restoration. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the single turn keeps the score mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—giving rest to forgotten souls—is signaled early and tightens when the broken lens's distress signal reframes the library's purpose. The arc moves from passive preservation to active revitalization, with each shard placement narrowing the path back to mere cataloging. Cost is present but muted: decades of weariness are mentioned, but no specific forfeiture or trade-off emerges on the page during the lens work itself. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than a confrontation with rising obstacles, fitting the inferred lens but lacking a sharp pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—building intergenerational trust under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens when Lena steadies Lin, a reversal that transforms skepticism into connection. The bell-ringing decision at closure forecloses the old celebratory use and declares a new, internal covenant, narrowing options with visible cost. The midnight runs function as escalating trials where stories and shared burdens rebuild fractured community. Agency is clear: Elara's choice to untie the ribbon and sound a single note is decisive and carries undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued through the breathing ritual. One tightening occurs when the solitary spark multiplies into a constellation, then coalesces into the map. However, the resolution arrives without protagonist agency testing a tradeoff; the golden reservoir simply flows free once she whispers recognition. No live option is foreclosed, no cost paid—Elara's compassionate exhales succeed on first attempt. The sailor's regret transmutes off-stage into gratitude without friction or renunciation visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering time's texture and escaping retrocognitive trap—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when the fragment disintegrates, but escalation is driven by mystical mechanics rather than protagonist agency under pressure. Coincidence (the garden's inherent geometry) enables rather than complicates resolution. One meaningful deepening is present, yet the cost is more conceptual (release from grief) than a visible forfeiture that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (freeing the seed vault before demolition) is signaled early and sustained. The bulldozer countdown provides external pressure, and the key-decoding creates a tightening (line 112 cipher dissolves). However, escalation is primarily clock-driven rather than driven by Elara's agency; she executes a pre-planned solution without on-page error, adaptation, or trade-off. The crew's silent vow (223) is a reversal, but it is passive reception rather than protagonist-forced turn. The cost is conceptual (stewardship acknowledged) but not visible in a choice that narrows options or exacts a felt price, placing this below the 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a forced trade-off. Elara's method (recording absences, placing the coil) proceeds linearly without reversal or cost; the forge simply glows and delivers the imprint. No on-page tightening narrows her options or imposes a visible price. The piece accumulates texture but lacks a causal pressure point where agency forecloses a path, keeping it below the 8.0 band entry threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is Elara seeking her own path, signaled early. The tightening occurs when the moonbeam reveals the hidden code, reweighting her options from "Abandon" to "Follow." However, the protagonist does not face a visible trade-off or cost at closure—she turns from the platform without dramatized hesitation or forfeited safety. The midnight train and the platform are present but do not test her commitment; she walks "without fear," which flattens the pressure rather than crystallizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—crafting a safe zone for inquiry—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hairline fracture appears, forcing Elara to choose between accepting imperfection or restarting. However, the reversal lacks genuine cost: she abandons the flawed piece "not in anger, but to make space for wholeness," and the text immediately reports her spirit feels lighter and unburdened. The resolution ("Starting anew, her spirit felt lighter") undercuts the trade-off; there's no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint after the turn. The final dome succeeds without complication, and external pressure (the ice melting, returning neighbors) remains abstract backdrop rather than forcing a time-bound or resource-constrained decision. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is present, but the cost at closure is narrated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting Lily from manipulation—is signaled early and drives Elara's choices. One meaningful tightening occurs when the journal reveals the tracker, raising the cost of inaction. However, the resolution depends on a coincidentally successful decoy rather than a protagonist trade-off with visible price; Silas chases the signal and vanishes, robbing the climax of earned consequence. The phobia is declared but never forces a micro-choice with felt cost, and the final "vulnerability is power" claim is asserted rather than tested through competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—to chart the night's emotional terrain through silence—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens as Elara layers silence upon silence. Yet there is no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or live tradeoff that narrows options or imposes a visible price. The task proceeds without complication; coincidence does not intrude, but neither does agency force a difficult turn. One meaningful deepening is present (the act of inscription itself), but the cost is implied warmth rather than a felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering where thoughts originate—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Unit Seven shifts from ignoring the violin (protocol adherence) to approaching it after loop thirty-one, driven by surfaced archives. This choice narrows options and triggers the sensory-echo amalgamation. However, the escalation feels more conceptual than visceral; there's no live opposition or competing cost that forces a tradeoff. The resolution lands through internal synthesis rather than a decision with visible sacrifice, fitting the accumulative lens but limiting felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to thaw mistrust via transparency. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara recognizes Kael's plea and chooses reciprocity over passive observation, projecting his symbols publicly. This choice narrows options (she reveals his vulnerability without consent, risking shame) and alters the relational terrain. However, the risk is never dramatized—Kael emerges grateful, the community adopts the practice without friction, and no tactical cost (time, social credit, refusal) appears on the page. The "mistrust dissolving like mist" and subsequent harmony feel granted rather than earned through visible struggle or trade-off, softening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and drives the ritual and confrontation. The phoenix vine's emergence provides one tightening; Kael's arrival and the maze's response form a second reversal that narrows options (his meter cracks, he flees). The cost is visible in the contrast (Elara's 2.9% versus his 98.7%), and the maze's agency forecloses Kael's challenge. However, the resolution feels coincidental rather than earned by Elara's active choice in the moment—the maze acts autonomously, reducing her agency. A second on-page choice or complication driven by Elara herself would have elevated the escalation and cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving that time moves sideways—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Kael's months of secret assembly and doubt ("what if time was merely a straight, lonely road?"), then tightens at the lever-pull moment. The hologram's unveiling and the zephyrs' recognition provide a meaningful deepening that reweights Kael's stance from proving to listening. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation is sufficient, though the reversal is contemplative rather than driven by a high-stakes decision with immediate external cost; the price paid is the foreclosure of his need to "prove" in favor of reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's code and offering acknowledgment—is clear and present throughout. Pressure accumulates through the layered description of water-born images and the Orion constellation alignment, and playing the phrase creates a meaningful beat. Yet the escalation lacks a felt tightening: Elias encounters no resistance, no cost in the attempt, no trade-off when he holds the fermata. The warmth and peace arrive as reward without visible price paid; there is no foreclosed path, no renunciation, no opportunity cost on the page. The story deepens texture but does not narrow options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—locating the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through the smudge discovery, which narrows options from abstract guilt to concrete recognition. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Elara's realization that her fault-tolerance failed Kael by tolerating her own pride. The auroral witness and final window moment crystallize her transformation with felt cost (humility, ongoing grief as anchor). Agency is clear: she chooses to lean close, to not look away, to trust the margin—all renunciations of her prior arrogance that foreclose the path of flawless oracle.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—appraising the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens when Leo finds the wheel, forcing a choice between dismissal and belief. The turn from skepticism to understanding narrows options with visible cost: he must now carry and voice a burden his grandfather bore alone. Agency is clear in the decision to turn the wheel and speak the truth. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; one meaningful tightening (tactile contact → comprehension) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—witnessing change—is stated early but never tested. Elara faces no opposition, dilemma, or cost; the tremor prompts travel, travel succeeds, observation continues. No on-page reversal narrows options or deepens pressure. The refuge's cracking wall is noted as "dialogue" but does not alter her stance or tactics. Agency is absent: she does not decide, renounce, or endure with visible sacrifice. The story unfolds as a meditative catalog rather than escalating conflict, and the ending restates the premise without dramatizing a trade-off or price.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling Liam's wonder—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One tightening occurs when Liam's tension eases and he accepts the curl, narrowing his options from withdrawal to engagement. The eclipse provides the pressure, but it arrives as external fortune rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is implied (time, emotional labor) but not visible on the page; Elara's method succeeds without trade-off or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories against oblivion—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece deepens through Elara's diary revelation: her decision to cut the dragon's eye "before the flames took it all" and her final dream add emotional weight. However, the historian himself faces no on-page tightening or trade-off; he simply receives and records. The cost is Elara's (burning books, the last dream), not the protagonist's. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification is sufficient, but the historian's own agency doesn't narrow options or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation with Elara—is signaled early and tightens when Silas seals the cookie and places it for the ferry, a concrete move that narrows his options. The reversal arrives when Elara responds to the visible fortune alone, not the microdot, forcing Silas to recognize that "open secrets need no cipher." The final trade-off (abandoning manipulation for vulnerability) forecloses the orchestration path with felt relational cost. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; coincidence (Elara's arrival timing) complicates but does not resolve, since the apology must still be spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—halt the possession before it completes—is signaled immediately and tightens through one meaningful escalation (anchor groans, window flickers). Kael's agency is renunciation of force in favor of rhetorical illumination, a credible tactical choice with on-page cost: he must trust Elara's will rather than impose banishment. The palette latch reversal is earned by prior pressure (the questions crack her isolation), and the final mixing of paints forecloses the cobalt-only path with visible price. No coincidence rescues; the protagonist's method drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming chronological homesickness into symphonic expression—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the mapping ritual, with the exhaustion timeframe providing a stated constraint. However, escalation is thin: the dizziness warning arrives late and does not force tactical adjustment; she completes all planned memory placements without omission or trade-off. The mirrored horizon's revelation (barn and hawk) arrives as validation rather than reversal. Agency is present in her methodical choices, but the cost at closure (changing her fortunes) feels more like expansion than forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is declared but never tested by a live on-page reversal or tightening. The "seventy-three times" prior and the shift to "this cycle held a shift" are told rather than dramatized; no visible escalation occurs between attempts. The procedural generation "sensing her resolve" and softening a whisper reads as external intervention rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and the release of the tablet carries no legible price—what path is foreclosed or what cost is paid remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (defeat numbness, rediscover music's pulse) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the drum's construction and the climactic vibration sequence, but escalation is largely external: Kael acts, Elara receives. The single meaningful tightening—vibration bypassing deafness—does reweight her options, yet the breakthrough arrives without a live cost or tradeoff on the page. No competing desire or fear creates friction; the resolution feels granted rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve integrity without confirming guilt—is signaled early and tightens once: the clay probe forces a choice between silence/flight and lateral truth-telling. Her decision to encode and send Nimbus again narrows options (she cannot now retreat) and the cost is legible: ongoing surveillance, no safe exit. The escalation is modest but sufficient under the Causal lens; the turn from panic-rejection to purposeful encoding is protagonist-driven and alters tactics visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reach the fissure or preserve the artifact—is signaled early and tightens by mid-story when the impossible choice crystallizes. The protagonist's agency (the third path: rope as bridge of intention, not utility) drives the turn. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-based; the poet sits in silence, then opts for surrender without a prior attempt or failure that would raise cost. One meaningful deepening occurs (the choice transforms from either/or to revelation), but the lack of embodied struggle in the middle beats keeps this in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—to unbind sound from silence—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Elara kneels, plays, and the hush transforms without obstacle or reversal. No live option is foreclosed; the sapling trembles, ash swirls, but these are ambient confirmations rather than pressure points. The piece accumulates texture rather than tightening choices, and no visible cost alters her tactics or final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to honor accidental truth within artifice—is clear and held throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when static reveals "genuine grief" beneath the counterfeit blend, forcing the subsume-or-discard choice. However, the decision feels predetermined by Kael's stated motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy") rather than a turn under pressure. Agency is present (he chooses to subsume), but the cost of that choice is not legible on the page—no client loss, professional fallout, or tactical consequence beyond internal shift. Escalation is conceptual rather than dramatically foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uplifting Elara—is signaled early and coheres through the draft scene. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liam reveals the retirement deadline, adding urgency. However, the escalation is modest: no competing pressure tests Elias's resolve, and the collaborative drafting proceeds without friction or trade-off. The final note is "en route," but we do not see its delivery or consequence, leaving the cost abstract. Agency is present (Elias initiates), but the stakes never rise above a single compassionate gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and sustained. The search provides a goal, and the partnership with Kael adds relational texture. However, escalation is mild: the pair move side-by-side without meaningful opposition, and the arbor is found rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. The dedication gesture at the end fulfills the stated intent but does not foreclose a live alternative or impose a visible trade-off on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—uncaging the primordial echo—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Silent Pause grants temporal access, and the pendant-key unlocks the cage. However, escalation lacks a live trade-off or narrowed option: Elara borrows time without visible depletion, sculpts the key without error, and succeeds on first attempt. No on-page reversal forces recalibration; coincidence (the giant's nap schedule) enables rather than complicates. The resolution is protagonist-driven but frictionless, and the cost—borrowed seconds, pendant coolness—remains abstract rather than a felt forfeiture that alters her world or self.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding Kael's disappearance and the orchard's silence. Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs via the ritual deepening (eyes placed, warmth, vision unfolds, silence reweighted). The tightening is meaningful—Elara's understanding forecloses active searching. Cost is legible: she must accept Kael's transformation rather than his return. Deduction: the vision is granted rather than earned through a choice or reversal that tests her commitment; the ritual succeeds without friction or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—becoming visible to Evans—is signaled early and escalates through spatial approach: cache retrieval, deliberate placement at the desk, concealment in the grate, and finally stepping out. The tightening is meaningful: Evans' arrival and recognition force Elara's irreversible choice. Agency is embodied: the caching action months prior and the sunbeam placement demonstrate forethought. However, the lack of friction or hesitation in the final step slightly reduces the felt cost; Elara's emergence reads smooth rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to control versus nature's autonomy—is signaled early and tightens through the linden-leaf insight that narrows her options (stop repairing, plant with change). One meaningful deepening occurs when memory of the bent oak reframes her method, and the final stance crystallization (awaiting storms with curiosity) forecloses her prior ritual with felt cost. However, the escalation operates more through reflection than concrete pressure forcing a trade-off; the cost is legible but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: Elias must find meaning in survival's "haggard awe" before exhaustion wins. The rain-trail pilgrimage tightens options (impulse after years of solitude → cairn memory → ravine discovery), and the brooch exchange is a clear agency beat that forecloses isolation and transfers legacy. The heartstone gift shifts tactics (painting focus from pigment-grinding to weaving memory threads). Cost is legible: seventeen years of sleepless vigil, Anya's loss, solitary endurance. Slight softness: Elara's appearance at the exact convergence moment leans toward coincidence complicating rather than Elias's agency fully driving the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—magnifying communal magic—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening. Elara's anxiety about not foreseeing the pilgrim does not escalate into a choice; she simply closes her eyes and trusts. The "prescribed method" of overlapping shadows arrives as a coincidental alignment rather than a protagonist-driven tactic. The climax summarizes the pearl's transformation and Elara's emotional shift without an on-page cost or a forfeited option. Agency is minimal; the unseen forces do the work while Elara observes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning and heartening returnees—is signaled early and tightens as Elara moves from private restoration to public offering. The single trumpet note at sunset is a concrete escalation that elicits visible reactions (sobbing, straightened spine, wide eyes), and the fisherman's tears over Anya's chart add a secondary deepening. Yet the escalation is more additive than crisis-driven; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost remains atmospheric rather than forcing a trade-off. The progression feels steady rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress and achieving clarity—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs at the booth when Elara must dare to surrender her maps, narrowing options to acceptance or retreat. Yet the reversal lacks genuine friction: no competing desire, no cost that alters later tactics. The phantom punch delivers resolution without complication; luck (the mythical object simply works) resolves rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices for this length, but the final reconfiguration grants emotional payoff without forfeiture, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can offer Liam solace—is signaled early and resolved at closure. The tile vision provides a tightening through emotional intensity, and the transcription narrows options by committing Elara to public compassion. Yet the escalation relies on emotional surge rather than a tactical dilemma or visible tradeoff; Elara does not forfeit skepticism so much as set it aside without friction. The vision itself is gift rather than struggle, and Liam's arrival at sunrise feels coincidentally timed rather than causally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover what happens after goodbye"—is abstract and lacks on-page escalation. No reversal tightens options; the solar storm and amulet activation simply deliver the answer via portal. Kaelen steps through without cost, witnesses a repository, and returns unchanged in capability. No trade-off, no foreclosed path, no live price. The "spatial mutiny" and magnetic mechanics are ornamental metaphor rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking asylum from her father's legacy—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reframes "fair trade" from subtraction to integration, which narrows her tactical options toward ethical consulting. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no external opposition tests her resolve, and the proposal she writes faces no immediate friction or visible cost within the scene, reducing the felt pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—archiving atmosphere to honor absence—is signaled early and sustained. The charting ritual provides one meaningful deepening (hum fades, dawn victorious) under the accumulative lens, but agency reads as continuity rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the final walk promises "tomorrow's hum," confirming perpetual devotion without visible friction or cost that would elevate escalation into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: to honor erased histories by collecting and layering fragments, anchoring his own unmoored identity. The poison label serves as a keystone that deepens his practice, adding Dr. Aris Thorne's story to his archive. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase—the new fragment reweights his purpose from abstract witnessing to intimate reconstruction. However, no on-page tightening or trade-off narrows his options or forces a sacrifice; he continues his routine without visible cost or a live alternative foreclosed. The piece demonstrates commitment but not agency-driven pressure that would push it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the riddle—is signaled early. The story offers one meaningful deepening when Elara plays the cello and the reimagined conversation clarifies the compass's metaphorical nature. However, no live option is foreclosed; no tactical shift or visible price alters her approach mid-scene. The resolution hinges on interpretive realization rather than a choice that narrows paths or forces a trade-off. Agency reads as passive reception (the hum "returned" the voice) rather than active decision with cost, keeping escalation in the mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—photographing the crater's final untouched dawn—is signaled early and tightens through the night vigil (outlasting wind, cold, grief) to the shutter-click climax. The accumulative pressure is coherent: time narrows, emotion deepens, the machine approach looms. Agency is endurance and attention (he outlasts the elements, witnesses the moment), which forecloses the path of retreat with visible cost (he descends into "the uncertain dawn of the new"). However, no reversals or live obstacles test his commitment; the vigil is sustained struggle rather than forced choice. The cost is felt but the escalation is linear deepening, not a turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (repair the drone before the ship departs) is signaled early and the harbor bell provides a time marker. However, pressure never tightens: Elara proceeds methodically without reversal, complication, or visible tradeoff. The resin application succeeds on the first attempt, and the drone's awakening is straightforward affirmation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cost is required; here the escalation is atmospheric declaration rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—confirming river origins at convergence—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: falcon return, condensation pattern, phrasebook phrase all converge to narrow her uncertainty. The deepening is meaningful but cerebral; Elara's agency is largely interpretive (deciphering, correlating) rather than decisional under competing pressures. The choice to drill arrives late and feels inevitable rather than a trade-off. Cost is conceptual (professional rebellion, isolation) but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the collapse and restore balance. The piece shows one meaningful deepening as Elara's rhythm shifts from slow cadence to triplet to spiraling dance, each coaxing new manifestations (water drop, ember, translucent figures). However, escalation is sequential accumulation without a pivot that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency visibly alter her path under pressure. The "final dissonance snap" is told, not shown through a contested choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve the memory before oxygen expires—is signaled early and tightens through the oxygen alarm chimes. The reversal occurs when panic surges at ten minutes but Aris consciously overrides instinct, using Elena's memory as anchor. Agency is clear: his choice to maintain slow, deliberate movements forecloses the rushed alternative with visible cost (his life). The price is legible and scales appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—proving truth despite legacy—is signaled early. The lattice-over-scuffs beat narrows options (Elias must look), and Elias's belief shift tightens the outcome. However, the escalation is thin: Kael's method succeeds on first attempt without complication or cost beyond past dismissals. No trade-off or visible price paid in this scene; the "hush" Kael chases is conceptual rather than a felt forfeiture that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (awakening the orchard to save Elias) is clear and consistent. The piece offers one meaningful deepening—the Heartwood awakening cascades through all plants and breaks Elias's fever—but the escalation reads as cumulative intensification rather than a tightening that forecloses options or imposes trade-offs. The ghost bride's ephemeral nature (she must conserve essence) is mentioned but never tested on the page; no moment forces her to choose between speed and substance, or between partial success and total dissolution. The resolution is achieved through ritual completion rather than a choice under competing pressures, and the cost (her disappearance) was预定 from the outset rather than earned through sacrifice of a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—carving a path from ruin to reverence—is signaled early and held throughout. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she follows her sleepwalking paths exactly as planned. The sewing proceeds without complication, error, or trade-off. The final act (tying thread to the orchid) reweights the goal from restoration to living resilience, but this shift feels thematic rather than a choice forced by pressure. Cost is asserted ("tears traced clean paths") but remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost faith through ritual reconnection—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara discovers the sundial base and commits to rebuilding its function. The noon alignment provides a clear pressure point where her action (placing the new gnomon) narrows options and transforms her exile into willing participation. However, the escalation operates primarily through accumulative metaphor rather than a trade-off with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only reframed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finalizing the pseudonym—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; the chalk code conveniently delivers the answer without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. Elara's agency is passive observation, not decision under pressure. The mailing of the letter carries no dramatized cost; it's ritualistic rather than conflicted, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (prevent the coup-by-misdirection) is signaled by line 103 and sharpened at 148. One clear tightening: Valerius dismisses her, forcing the covert-correction path. The corrected chart and decision to bypass Valerius for Captain Idris constitute agency that forecloses direct confrontation. Cost is visible in her solitary risk and the "fragile hope" she carries. No secondary reversals, but the single escalation is motivated and the closure choice alters tactics under the inferred Causal lens. The pre-dawn timeframe imposes urgency without a ticking-clock scene, keeping pressure steady rather than ratcheting.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (finding healing for unspoken apology) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara evokes the memory-vision, narrowing Kael's emotional stance. However, escalation is driven by Elara's ritual rather than Kael's agency—he is passive recipient of the vision. The "already forgiven" resolution arrives without visible cost or trade-off on the page; Kael does not renounce pride, forfeit a path, or make a choice that forecloses an option. The ending grants relief without a price that alters later tactics or crystallizes consequence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks the felt cost required for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to transform her trauma-bearing isolation into present empathy for Leo. The piece tightens through one meaningful deepening—decrypting the cast's symbols triggers the camp-boy memory, which she then reframes as "a bridge" rather than "a ghost," enabling the whispered comfort and coral placement. Agency is enacted through attention and renunciation (unknotting old silence into present purpose) with visible cost: acknowledging failure to comfort past souls. The escalation is Accumulative rather than Causal; density increases via layered interpretation until the final image reconfigures her burden as connection. No overt antagonist or reversal, but the design holds under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the daydream's unfolding (ghost-sounds, blooming fresco, grandmother's memory) and tightens when the fragment aligns with its luminous counterpart. That integration reweights her relationship to the past, shifting from loss to "mature understanding." The cost is conceptual (joy is no longer lost but developed within her) rather than a trade-off between competing goods. Agency is mostly contemplative; she observes and places the fragment rather than choosing between live options under duress. One meaningful deepening is present, but the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the mural's hidden truth—is signaled early, but escalation is replaced by sequential revelation delivered via the coin's acoustic prism. No reversal narrows options; Elara kneels, finds the nickel, experiences visions, and chooses curiosity over certainty without friction or trade-off. The "choice" lacks visible cost: she packs her tools "with lightness" and walks away "already listening," framing resolution as pure gain. Agency is contemplative reception, not decision under pressure that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (evade cognitive taxation via botanical cipher) is signaled early and coherent. The piece offers setup (planting the seed, coded conversations) but no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The "warp initiates at moonrise" is declared, cicadas sing, but no concrete cost or tactical shift occurs. The resistance method unfolds in summary rather than through a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming insomnia's pain into beauty—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through centuries of longing, but escalation is thin: the poet repeats the same ritual (lullabies, tracing the postcard) without a narrowing choice or tactical shift until the shell spontaneously resonates. The climactic turn is externally triggered (the wind shifts, the shell vibrates) rather than driven by protagonist agency. The "blossom armistice" arrives as a gift, not a trade-off with visible cost, keeping this below high-band thresholds under accumulative escalation standards.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early, but no opposition or complication tests it. The ritual proceeds without friction: light falls, song emerges, orchids capture echoes, cataloging awaits. The crack is framed as "destiny," not a problem to solve, so its presence adds texture but no escalation. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (dawn's arrival) enables rather than complicates, violating the lens rule.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restore trust before the council meeting forces irreversible division—is signaled early and tightens through the night. One meaningful escalation occurs when Elara reaches "the final knot: a triad of glyphs for loyalty, memory, and hope," which tests her method at higher complexity. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution (her translation choice), and the cost is legible (the emotional and temporal price of the silence, the risk of failure). The timeframe "before paths diverge at first light" creates urgency, though the physical constraint (time running out) is asserted more than shown through deteriorating conditions or mounting pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonize preservation and geothermal need—is signaled early and tightens when Kael decodes the architect's plea. The mountain's exhalation raises immediate cost (will the vents hold? will carvings survive?), and the resolution shows visible success with Elara and Borin's convergence. Agency is clear: Kael's cipher work and vent placement drive the outcome. The escalation is modest but present; the story trades multiple reversals for accumulative pressure as the building "breathes," consistent with a situational/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias will continue hiding his past or reclaim it. The dust-mote vortex acts as a tightening that "shatters his reinvention," and the decision to write truth is a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation is reflective rather than situational—no external pressure forces the choice; it arises from internal readiness. The cost (ending solitude, risking Clara's judgment) is named but not tested on the page. One credible tightening under the accumulative lens, but agency feels contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or complication. No reversal narrows options; Elara traces grain, recalls her mother's words, reads the logbook, and arrives at insight without friction. The stated butterfly effect (the diverted flight) is backstory context, not present-scene escalation. Cost is declared ("painful gap," "necessary distances") but not demonstrated through a trade-off or foreclosed path in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and pursued through observation and waiting. Pressure accumulates via sensory intensification (vibration, crack, fireflies) under the Accumulative lens, but the escalation lacks a moment where Elara must trade one option for another or foreclose a path. The firefly memory deepens emotional resonance, yet the protagonist's agency at closure is passive witnessing rather than a decision with visible cost. Releasing the feather gestures toward renunciation, but the act does not narrow future options in a dramatized way.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish before her own memory fades—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens through each seed test: the wedding feast dissolves (first reversal of expectation), the sailor's homecoming flickers and releases (deepening the pattern), and the final apology-path blazes with forgiveness before fading (climactic confirmation). The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-agonistic, fitting the chosen lens, with visible cost in Elara's tears and her acceptance of release over capture. However, the protagonist's agency is more observational than decisional—she plants seeds and interprets results rather than making a high-stakes choice that forecloses a path, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Corbin's desire to create moments of genuine serendipity through precise orchestration. The tightening occurs when the elderly man approaches and the predicted wave/starlight convergence triggers the discovery, narrowing options to this exact moment. The man's response (kneeling, tearful smile, transformed gait) provides visible consequence. However, Corbin's own agency at closure is limited—he observes validation rather than making a high-cost choice. The coincidence of perfect timing and the man's precise need borders on authorial convenience despite the careful setup.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara completing the cosmic verse to midwife Kael's departure—is signaled early and resolved on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs: Kael's fear alchemizes into resolve as the verse sinks in, and Elara's anchor dissolves. Yet escalation is thin: no reversal or complication tests Elara's method, and the inscription proceeds smoothly without setback. The "nostalgia ban" and Kael's orphaning provide context but remain offstage; no immediate choice forces a trade-off between competing costs. The cost—Elara's solitude, the vanished dust speck—is legible but gentle, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking communion with the bay's spirit to guide her work—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by opposition or internal contradiction. The pond ritual deepens her understanding (rings as stanzas, patterns revealing patience), yet this is accumulation of meaning rather than escalation of pressure. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; her reckoning simply confirms her existing purpose with added clarity. The shift from pre-dawn to day serves as temporal punctuation but does not narrow choices or impose cost. Agency appears as attention and interpretation, valid under Accumulative lens, but the final reconfiguration carries no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and fulfilling the bargain of salvaged innocence—is clear and braided with Elias's need to translate pain into connection. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through deepening reflection rather than causal reversals; the final realization that innocence evolves into wisdom reweights the premise. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost on the page; the walk down with the box "secure" and "no longer an anchor" feels like acceptance without sacrifice or tactical trade-off. The piece lacks a moment where agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) narrows concrete choices or forces a price legible in action rather than perception.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to puzzle out new equations for hope." However, escalation is thin—Elara arranges decorations, launches the trial balloon, observes success in Kael's village, then journals the result without meaningful tightening or a live cost that narrows her options. The gauge chimes success; no reversal, trade-off, or forfeited path appears on the page. The timeline vignette (Kael clearing the garden) provides reported success but no on-page pressure that Elara must navigate with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—is signaled in the opening beats and sustained through investigation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film negative reveals preserved joy against the diaries' despair, reweighting the quest from curiosity to covenant. However, no on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; the discovery always rewards rather than threatens her, and no live choice forces her to trade one value for another. The "legacy's burden" remains abstract; no visible cost (time, stamina, social credit, or physical tool) alters her tactics on the page. Agency is present but operates only as accumulation toward affirmation, not renunciation or endurance with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early but never encounters meaningful resistance. Each mirror responds "instantly," "slowly, miraculously," or after he "sang on"; no mirror refuses, no tactic fails, no adaptation is required. The borrowed heartbeat weakens but he "never wavered," and he completes the final verse before it stills. The accumulative design promises deepening pressure, but the painter's success is unearned by obstacle or trade-off, flattening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (anchoring peace through self-sacrifice) is signaled early and tightens once when Kaelen's confession changes the elder's response from contempt to negotiation, narrowing options. His agency is renunciation—stepping aside as "the first act of trust"—with visible cost (loss of title, departure from the terrace). The elder's spitting and the delegate's scoffing provide authentic resistance. One meaningful tightening fits this length and the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres through the signing ritual to the final departure, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinction—is signaled early and tightens when Silas reaches the convergence and must commit the egg to exposure. The act of release is protagonist-driven with visible cost: he surrenders the relic, weeps, and walks away. No multiple reversals are needed; the single deepening (unwrapping and placing the egg) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: physical discomfort, emotional fracture, and the finality of leaving the egg to the elements. Pressure coheres through the pilgrimage structure and crescendos at the star.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—harvesting silenced echoes to plant memory-seeds—is signaled early and unified. Pressure accumulates through the untangling sequence (silvery lullaby, crimson verse, gold-and-obsidian knot), each strand adding density. However, escalation operates as additive difficulty rather than a tightening that narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off; she succeeds at each step without visible forfeit. The final knot dissolves "with a final, gentle motion," offering resolution without a legible cost that charges the image. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening lacks a cadence break or loss that would elevate pressure into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—how to ethically share stories—is signaled early and tightens through Lena's accusation, which reframes Elias's method as monologue disguised as revolution. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: his realization that reciprocity, not subversion, is the true path. Agency is enacted through renunciation (abandoning the puppet stage) and a new stance (transcriber/witness), and the cost is conceptual and relational—surrendering control, earning trust from scratch. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient but quiet; pressure accumulates through reflection rather than contested on-page choices, and the final third is largely future-oriented, which dilutes immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    One dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) is signaled early and sustained. The monarch's arrival is the sole meaningful turn, shifting Elara from signal-building to immediate care—a tightening that narrows her ritual's purpose. That shift does not foreclose a live option with visible cost; she simply adds the act of splinting without abandoning her structures or her vow. The butterfly's departure and the wind's gentle untying suggest completion, but no trade-off or loss alters Elara's later stance—she carries "honored histories within her, transiently rooted in purpose, forever changed" without dramatizing what she surrendered or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before silence becomes eternal—is signaled early and pursued with one meaningful deepening (the rope's final braid becomes a "permanent cipher"). The reconfiguration imposes tactile patience and forecloses alternate methods. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: Elara's role shifts from bronze caster to keeper of echoes, a renunciation with felt weight. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices, though no on-page reversal tests commitment; the ritual proceeds without complication or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: she must open the directive before humidity dissolves the seal. The storm creates a ticking clock, but no visible trade-off or complication tests her resolve before she acts. She presses the seal at the ~40% mark and the mystical solution unfolds; no mid-sequence reversal narrows options. The path "choosing her" feels thematic rather than a dramatized pressure that forces a stance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (align tile to uncloak resonance) is signaled early but escalation is minimal: Enlil rotates the tile "with infinitesimal care" and alignment clicks into place without obstacle, trade-off, or failed attempt. The "twenty years" of preparation occur off-page; on-page action is a single rotation that succeeds immediately. No reversal or tightening narrows options, and the cost is purely affirmative (warmth, recognition, covenant sealed) rather than a visible forfeiture or endurance that forecloses a path. Pressure remains static from setup to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (release resentment) is clear, but escalation is passive: Elara guides, Kael's body "remembers," and the emotional shift arrives without a live tightening choice that narrows options. The broken-then-whole pin offers a reversal, but it's presented as grace-given rather than earned by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid—decades of bitterness dissolve "like mist" with no trade-off or loss. One meaningful pressure point exists (receiving the box), but it lacks cost legibility required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates texturally: fog luminescence, the dream's hesitant flicker, and Elara's deepening synchronization. The dream's approach and entry into the sextant provide one meaningful tightening, and the twilight-frost deadline adds temporal urgency. However, agency is muted: Elara does not face a live dilemma or trade-off; she executes her plan without error, and the dream drifts to her because of "harmonic resonance" rather than a risky choice that narrows options. The cost—if any—is not legible on the page; the astronomer's grief is mended, but Elara's own sacrifice or loss is unstated.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara realizes "the ribbon was the method" and shifts from rigid repair to flexible weaving. That turn narrows her options under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a live trade-off: no moment where using the ribbon costs her a safer, more conventional repair or risks structural failure. Lyra's arrival resolves the stake without on-page resistance or a complicating reversal, and the "breach of contract" timeframe functions as backstory rather than active pressure that alters tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: activating the cameo and accessing forbidden knowledge. One meaningful tightening: the orchard's non-response forces Elara to abandon extraction and adopt openness. Agency is present in her decision to suit up and kneel, but the resolution hinges on her emotional posture rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible price. The ledger's transformation and the cameo's etching provide closure participation, yet the cost (stewardship burden) remains conceptual and lightly sketched rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—rescue Kael and reclaim the lost lesson—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Kael is fraying and the diary's gap must be filled, but escalation relies on thematic assertion ("the price is not a buried truth, but the courage to nurture the void") rather than a protagonist trade-off that narrows live options. Elara's voiced fear sprouts the vine, a micro-turn, yet the Warden's capitulation ("stepped aside") feels coincidental—her renegotiation is persuasive rhetoric, not a visible cost that alters her tactics afterward. Kael retrieves the book and vanishes; no on-page consequence shows what Elara forfeited to make that possible. The accumulative lens moderates the demand for causal reversals, but the final "rescue is complete" remains told rather than dramatized with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (recapture Kael's essence) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates via the memory-alteration frame (Kael's features shift, voices blur), but the story lacks an on-page tightening that narrows Lyra's options through her own agency. The journal discovery is coincidental—she finds it without prior clues—and the insight it delivers ("unkindle the solace") resolves the tension via external wisdom rather than a choice or sacrifice that forecloses a live path. The card's release is a renunciation, but the trade-off feels abstract (surrendering "desperate need") rather than a concrete, felt cost that we witness her weigh.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—resolving the temporal anomaly and honoring erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door appears "precisely where architectural blueprints showed solid granite," creating the schism Elara must resolve. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increases as she weaves the diplomat's seal motif into the governance braid, but the escalation lacks visible friction: no failed attempts, no competing tactics, no moment where her method might not work. The resolution feels procedural rather than hard-won, and the cost (weaving absence into remembrance) registers as thematic rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaim foundational silence—is signaled in the opening third and pressure is sustained (frantic luminescence, weaponized storm, fraying hope). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael places the stone on the nexus and shifts from projection to listening, narrowing options and risking failure. The bloom of hush provides a visible resolution with on-page consequence (peace restored, energy beings calmed). However, the opposition is environmental rather than agentic, and the stone's success feels smooth rather than fraught; no live cost or visible trade-off accompanies the act of listening, which keeps escalation from reaching high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—proving the alignment is deliberate signal—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens as twilight approaches and the alignment window narrows, providing one temporal squeeze. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric; the protagonist faces no on-page obstacle, competing choice, or reversal that tests her commitment. The survivor camps' dismissal is told rather than dramatized as friction. The final convergence of Vega and Deneb feels ordained rather than earned through protagonist struggle, and the vision from Master Aris removes uncertainty at the peak beat. Cost is visible (thirty years, isolation) but not dramatized as a trade-off in the ending moment.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (sculpting identity into collective memory) is clear and remains coherent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: initial shadow-watching → visceral echo of the forecourt → bold conjecture → writing as stitch. The "bold conjecture" moment tightens options (she decides the fog is canvas, not barrier), and the final acceptance raises the image's charge. However, the transition from solitude to belonging carries no visible trade-off or forfeited path; the story gives her what she wants without dramatized cost, weakening the pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the mosaic's message to combat despair—is signaled early and pursued with clear agency. However, the escalation is thin: once Elara arrives, the knot's flame immediately solves the problem of darkness without complication or reversal. No meaningful tightening narrows her options; the mosaic's wisdom is revealed, absorbed, and internalized in a single smooth beat. The resolution lacks visible trade-off or cost; Elara walks away buoyed rather than bearing a price for her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: sibling reconciliation during a pause in conflict. Pressure accumulates through the observational lens—Elara tracks the crab, reads Kael's tear, opts for memory over blame—producing one meaningful deepening. The hermit crab's choice to shed its shell serves as external mirror that narrows Elara's tactical options to gentleness. Cost is legible (she foregoes argument, risks rejection) but the resolution arrives somewhat passively; Kael's shift is foreseen rather than fought for. One clear tightening under the Accumulative lens, though agency at closure is more reactive than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—collecting the gilded hush as antidote to claustrophobia—is signaled early and maintained. The celestial hour provides a meaningful tightening: gravity inverts, the hush arrives, and Elara must hold focus. Her agency is attention and endurance ("by limiting exposure to visual noise and internal panic"), forecloses the path of avoidance, and the doll's release marks visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices, though the protagonist's waiting posture limits dramatic friction. The sprout's "quiet rebellion" extends thematic resonance but does not escalate external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching Leo to find comfort in silence—is signaled in the second paragraph and remains coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates through Leo's physical tension, his flinching, and his initial inability to hear beyond "the frantic drumming of his own heart," then deepens when Elara introduces the grandmother memory, which acts as a tightening that reweights the silence from void to companionship. However, escalation is gentle and linear; no reversal or complication tests Elara's method. Leo's agency is passive (he listens, he lowers his shoulders, he cries), and the resolution feels granted by Elara's patience rather than earned through Leo's active choice or renunciation. The final smile and his words carry emotional cost (grief acknowledged) but lack a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    The ticking clock (sunrise deadline) provides external pressure, and the peeling of paint layers functions as one meaningful tightening that narrows her task. Yet the climax—lifting the final obsidian layer to reveal the staircase—is resolved without complication or cost; the mural appears as foretold, and Elara's subsequent pivot (speaking glyphs instead of ascending) lacks on-page friction or a trade-off. The stakes shift from "find the stairway" to "restore the land" without a visible price or foreclosed path, weakening the escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the sanctuary's threshold against encroaching despair—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara links through scars and guides the foreign presence to breathe, but the pressure remains largely internal and allegorical; the "suffocating despair" never manifests as a concrete antagonist or test that narrows live options. The cost (remaining isolated but now compassionately connected) is legible but not deeply dramatized. Agency is present in her choice to link rather than open the door, qualifying as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—alchemizing personal pain into meaning—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elara volunteers without hesitation, a clear agency moment, and the Heartroot contact narrows the outcome to transformation or failure. However, escalation is thin: no on-page complication or resistance tests her resolve between volunteering and success. The glitchy texts urge "FOCUS THE PROMISE! NOW!" but this is external cheerleading, not a dramatized obstacle she navigates. The "crystalline chime" and heat mark success, yet no visible trade-off or intermediate failure forces a tactical shift. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the piece needed one micro-reversal or cost-legible choice to tighten pressure before the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the dynasty's hidden truth—is signaled early and remains coherent. The story provides one meaningful tightening when the dust pattern leads to the panel, and the letter reweights Elara's understanding of her role. However, escalation is mild: the search unfolds smoothly without setbacks, and the resolution arrives as a gift rather than through a choice that forecloses other options. The cost at closure is primarily emotional relief (burden lifted) rather than a visible price paid or path renounced, which limits the pressure's final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing possibility's shape—is signaled early but remains conceptual and untested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Kael's options; he moves through the orchard, finds the program, performs the dance, and unsnaps the clasp without friction, failure, or cost. The vow to the dying queen is recounted memory, not a present dilemma. The ending delivers the goal without sacrifice, luck solving what agency should have earned. Under any lens, escalation is absent and closure feels gifted rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to magnify small kindnesses and mend her own fragmentation. The discovery of the button deepens her understanding, but no live option is foreclosed. Elara faces no opposition, external or internal; the box yields its secret without resistance. The tightening is conceptual (understanding the system's hidden heart) rather than a choice under pressure. Cost is claimed in the final lines ("broken heart not healed, but held") but remains asserted mood rather than visible forfeiture or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (broadcasting suppressed census records before capture) is clear and tightens once when enforcers close in. The puddle-map, key, and projector sequence provides a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens, but Elara's agency reads passive—she follows pre-established steps (whispered legends, hidden booth, coded signal) rather than making a difficult trade-off that narrows live options. The enforcers' arrival supplies external pressure but no on-page cost that alters her tactics or stance; she simply stands and smiles.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before its coded words poison the valley's peace—is signaled in the first quarter and drives each beat. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: whisper, pause, fragment of lullaby, intentional silence, final breathy whisper, then absolute silence. Agency is clear: Elias chooses each note and pause, "weaving calm into the morning's fabric" through negative space, transforming memory into a gentle force. The timeframe ("as dewdrops form") tightens the liminal window, and the vested hush descends with visible cost (tears, reverent packing). One meaningful deepening—the shift from anxious prophecy to restored harmony—satisfies the requirement; the cost is legible in the final tears and the world waking "unaware of the battle fought in whispers."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding messages in leaves—is signaled early, but no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. Elara seeks a message, finds a marked leaf, places it, and receives confirmation without complication, cost, or tactical adjustment. The "moonstone dust speck" arrives as a key that unlocks validation rather than a choice-forcing pressure. No live option is narrowed; the story arc is discovery → affirmation → resumption, with no causal turn driven by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara learning to navigate uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle seizes: forcing it would break it, so she must improvise with waterfall mist. This is one meaningful choice under pressure, and the cost (surrendering her need for control) is legible. However, the escalation is more thematic accumulation than causal pressure; the discovery sequence (locket→latch→cavern) reads as a treasure hunt without meaningful tactical reversals or obstacles that test commitment. The admiral's grief and the fire remain off-page context rather than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the failure represented by Kael—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is minimal: Elara encounters no resistance, error, or complication during the ritual; she moves from intent to completion in a single linear arc. The coin "flares," the starlight "flows," and the crucible "fuses" without setback or tightening that would narrow her options. The ending asserts transformation ("weight transmuted...into sacred anchor") but the price is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses another path. One meaningful tightening or deepening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: integrating laughter to heal Cora's spectral regret. Pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens—Elara's playing invites confession, then shifts to laughter-weaving, which brightens Cora's form and triggers release. One meaningful tightening: the transition from sorrow-anchoring to joy-injection narrows the tactic and changes Cora's state. However, Elara faces no resistance, reversal, or cost to her own options; Cora's transformation unfolds smoothly without a visible price paid by the protagonist. The closure reconfigures Cora's state with felt cost (dissolution), but the lack of protagonist agency-under-pressure keeps this at the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael walks, braces, remembers, theorizes in a loop without cost. The formula he whispers ("Mercy = Σ (small kindnesses) / (opportunity for cruelty)") is an intellectual claim, not a trade-off or tactic shift. The final act—looping the strap and walking forward—does not foreclose a live option or force a sacrifice. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that changes knowledge or options; here the ending restates the premise without reweighting it through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (honoring Hemlock's overlooked history) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through three paintings, each hidden detail tightening the resonance between fragment and memory. The fragment's warmth shift ("no longer just glass, but a key") is the sole reversal, narrowing options and enabling the final placement. Agency manifests as ritual attention rather than decision under friction—Elara does not forfeit or renounce a live alternative. The cost (permanent anchor, city transformed) is conceptual and felt but does not foreclose a personal path with on-page price to her.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing Elias's unfinished gift—is signaled early and drives the action. Leo's agency (waiting, ascending, retrieving, vowing delivery) advances each beat, and the fluorescent's death provides a timed pressure point. The ghost's urgent plea and the dual barrels clicking together create a meaningful deepening. However, the story lacks a true reversal or complication; Leo faces no obstacle beyond routine problem-solving, and the cost (taking on the vow) feels more like acceptance than a trade-off that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    One dominant stake is clear: compressing eternity into a moment. Pressure accumulates through description (rustling crescendo, cracks of light), but escalation is textural rather than driven by protagonist agency or narrowed options. The rupture is enacted by pulling a lever with no prior on-page reversal or choice that forecloses a path. The "precipice: the system could not hold" is declared, not earned through a tightening sequence of decisions. Cost at closure is conceptual (evolution of the library) but remains abstract; no visible trade-off or altered tactic appears.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (vindicating Kaelen's interpretation) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Elara enacts Kaelen's mirror-covering method without complication, the shard glows on cue, and Valerius concedes immediately. No on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off; the temporal storm serves as atmospheric setup rather than a tactical obstacle. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("reclaim the light stolen by midnight") is declared early but never gains concrete shape or cost: what happens to the world or to Kael if he fails? The wilt is presented as obstacle, yet it resolves instantly when the light returns—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Midnight is described as "a sentient shadow" that will "willingly surrender the light each morning," but this negotiated détente is told in summary rather than dramatized as a choice that narrows options. Under any lens, escalation is asserted ("crushing weight," "knees buckled") but not built through a decision that changes the tactical picture.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the threshold where explanations fail—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs via the psychometry reading: Elara receives Thorne's epiphany, which reweights her quest from seeking a location to accepting internal revelation. The cost is legible: she forgoes her usual practice (scent collection) and leaves empty-handed, foreclosing her role as cataloger. However, escalation is driven more by inherited wisdom than by protagonist agency under pressure; Thorne's vision does the causal work, and Elara's acceptance feels passive. The price (renunciation) is visible but arrives without a prior difficult choice or trade-off that she herself navigates.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—navigating without GPS by returning to ancestral wisdom—is signaled early. Pressure is coherent but does not escalate sharply; the storm relents rather than forcing a harder trade-off. The carving sequence deepens her connection but lacks a visible on-page price that forecloses an option. Agency is present in the choice to carve without sketches, yet the decision feels meditative rather than a tightening that narrows live alternatives. One meaningful pressure point (GPS failure as invitation) is sufficient at this length, but the cost at closure remains felt rather than unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding nocturnal bloom—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The glass revelation provides one meaningful deepening that reweights the question. However, no live opposition or resource constraint tests Elara's commitment; she waits, the sun rises, the answer appears. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical, and no visible price is paid for the insight—she does not surrender a prior belief or opportunity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—correcting historical suppression—is signaled early and drives the retrocognitive vision. The tightening occurs when Elias rearranges the stones to redirect Anya, narrowing her options and enabling escape. Yet the escalation is spectral; Elias faces no on-page trade-off or price for his intervention, and the resolution (Anya escapes, official record is false) arrives as discovery rather than choice under duress. The vision provides one meaningful reversal, but cost legibility is missing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reimagining civilization through craft—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates via remembered sensory threads and conceptual layering, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is primarily internal and conceptual; no external reversal or live opposition tests Elara's resolve. The final act of sketching and burying the bottle deepens commitment, but no visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative appears—she had no competing path to renounce. The story tells us "the foundation was laid" without showing a price paid or tactic altered.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara seeks to archive the emotional resonance of the foghorn's last note. The tightening occurs when the memory surfaces and she recognizes the prophecy embedded in the wax shaving, narrowing her purpose from preservation to activation. The silent apple-fall serves as confirmation rather than a choice point, and Elara's agency is receptive—she accepts the revelation without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option that would raise cost legibility. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is present, but the protagonist does not drive the turn through decision.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reopen the vortex to discover borrowed time's texture. The ritual provides one tightening—each seed placement reduces chaos, building toward the vortex's opening—but this is methodology, not escalation driven by protagonist agency under pressure. The stakes remain abstract; no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off dramatized. The vortex's "pulsing" and the rose petal unfurling are atmospheric payoffs, not choices that narrow Elara's path. Cost is conceptual (the "covenant") rather than felt in a forfeited resource or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—sound the alarm or trust her data—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour when prophecy and instruments collide. The escalation is clear: memory of past false alarm raises cost, the solstice alignment forces the choice, and her restraint forecloses ritual path with visible consequence (the Abbot's approval, legacy shift). Agency is decision with on-page cost. No reversal complexity, but one meaningful pressure point suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: to find strength in vulnerability through empathic communion with falling stars. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brilliant meteor's arc syncs Elian's entire being with its descent, narrowing his understanding and altering his stance from custodian to guardian. The escalation is driven by protagonist attention and the act of tracing, though agency reads more as receptive witness than active decision that forecloses options. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of armor, acceptance of fragility) and legible in the final image, though the price lacks a visible trade-off or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the covenant and preserving unspoken words—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through the daily ritual's repetition and the decisive tightening when Elias's gaze shifts from hives to the recluse, prompting the realization that completes the bridge. The ghost's dissolution is the on-page cost, forecloses the cycle, and validates the guardianship. However, the recluse never faces a meaningful dilemma or trade-off; his compassionate gaze suffices without friction or renunciation that would raise the stakes higher.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding time's texture before borrowed hours expire. The urn-fragment trigger at line 74 narrows options by casting Kael into timelessness, forcing the rediscovery beat. However, the garage-sale method is introduced retrospectively ("For months, he'd hidden truths") rather than dramatized as an on-page reversal that tests commitment. Elara's arrival provides a tightening at closure, but her instant comprehension lacks friction. One meaningful pressure point lands, but the escalation under the accumulative lens feels more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The kite's fall is an external event Elara passively witnesses; her response (walk, find feather, write) unfolds without friction, trade-off, or tightening. No reversal or deepening alters her options; the feather arrives as a gift rather than a constraint. The escalation guardrail for Accumulative/Textural requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the found feather simply enables the predetermined act of writing with no visible price or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (restore orchard dialogue) is signaled early and tightens through patient iteration: pillar three's resistance, western oak brightening, ferns sprouting. The final connection—Heartstone pillar, deep chime, warmth radiating—delivers a meaningful deepening that narrows Kael's remaining path to zero (his death) with visible cost. Agency is renunciation and endurance; no antagonist required. One hesitation: escalation reads as accumulation rather than rising opposition, so pressure coheres but does not sharpen into a peak turn—appropriate for the Accumulative lens but leaving stakes feeling more resolved than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding homecoming's chemistry) is signaled early but never tightens into a forced choice or visible trade-off. Aris encounters no obstacles: the footprints appear conveniently, the fissure is accessible, the basin confirms her hypothesis without complication. Elias's presence adds convergence but no conflict—they agree immediately. The story accumulates images and insights but lacks escalation under pressure; the resolution is revelation without cost, and protagonist agency does not narrow options or impose a price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to let a garden reclaim the battlefield and honor the broken Concord of Tides. The story delivers one meaningful deepening when the nightingale announces "The first root has touched water. The submerged concord is rising"—a lyric turn that reweights hope from abstract to imminent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens remains more additive (plover → cormorant → sandpipers → nightingale) than tightening; no option is foreclosed, no competing desire tests Kael's resolve, and the final green shoot arrives as confirmation rather than a choice or sacrifice. The visible cost at closure is implied (years of labor ahead, "he would return tomorrow") but not dramatized as a price paid on this page. Agency is present but gentle; the story leans on accumulation without the sharpening pressure or forfeiture that would elevate conflict into the 7+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—solving the riddle to reach Elara—is signaled early and tightens once when Kael tries failed methods, then succeeds via the leaf. Pressure is situational: the riddle itself, not an antagonist, supplies the constraint. The final choice (walking east) narrows options and forecloses retirement, but no live alternative is dramatized on the page; the decision feels preordained once the message appears. Cost is visible in the act of leaving but not tested by competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding her grandfather's disappearance—is signaled early and remains coherent. The glimpse of the Lyre introduces a meaningful tightening: her fifteen-year confusion "shatters" and she gains a hypothesis with coordinates to pursue. However, this reversal arrives via cosmic coincidence (the shutdown stabilizing the field) rather than Elara's agency or a choice that narrows options. The story offers one deepening but lacks a decision that forecloses a path with on-page cost, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (heal the fractured sky) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The swapping sequence provides one meaningful escalation structure (pawns → pieces of higher rank), and each swap triggers an incremental sky-healing response, demonstrating coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal narrows Kael's options or forces a trade-off; each piece swaps smoothly without complication, resistance, or cost. The corrupted queen and king exchanges are the most charged moments, yet they resolve immediately into warmth and light. The ending delivers change but not visible price—Kael gains forgiveness and alignment without forfeiting or enduring anything on the page. The absence of agency-driven cost and the lack of a tightening choice cap the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—documenting humanity's small gestures—is signaled early but remains declarative. No meaningful tightening occurs: each spelled word adds another echo without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The ritual proceeds without opposition, cost, or reversal. The final reconfiguration (trapped echoes → living chorus) shifts meaning but lacks protagonist agency or visible price; the transformation is atmospheric rather than earned through decision or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding home after ten years of avoidance—is signaled early and the timeframe shift ("numbness had become a heavier burden") creates one meaningful tightening. The seeding action forecloses illusion ("deliberately set her mercury glass aside") with visible cost ("Pain surged, sharp as shattered glass"). The escalation reads under Accumulative lens: density builds to the ritual, then the bookstore's response. However, the final passage opening feels slightly exterior to Elara's agency; the mountain "responded" rather than her forcing a path. The walk toward light is poised but lacks a second on-page choice that tests the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: break the woven hush to atone for his past mistake. Pressure accumulates through the decoding task, which becomes a silent game where "each thread was a move" and "each knot a lesson he'd neglected." The method (winnowing frayed threads, isolating intentional breaks) narrows his path to the labyrinth solution. One meaningful tightening occurs when the border reveals "the perfect defense against Scholar's Mate"—the lesson he denied his prince—forcing him to accept it now. Agency is decision-based (he chooses to decode, align, and release the village), and the village's awakening is the direct result. Cost is somewhat diffuse: he "untangled his own guilt" and "chose forgiveness," but the on-page price during the labor itself is more contemplative than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: shift the community from blame to understanding before the ritual. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as refractions layer, but escalation is minimal—Elara faces no tactical obstacle, Borin's objection dissolves instantly, and the resolution arrives without a visible trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (foreman's guilt, stonemason's tears), but the lack of felt cost at closure keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation proceeds through accumulative deepening: each matched fracture-pockmark pair tightens the ritual's cost and Kael's emotional investment. The final drop of resin ("the promise: to remember the wholeness she brought, not the breaking") forecloses retreat with visible emotional and conceptual cost. Agency is renunciation and endurance under mortal pressure, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (honoring the hidden promise to Lena) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: the wrong turn born of grief forces Elias into the cave, deepening the journey from mechanical errand to emotional reckoning. The final act—placing the shell with reverence—is protagonist-driven and forecloses clinging to sorrow, with cost legible in the line "beauty resides in the fractures, not despite them." Pressure accumulates texturally (cracked mirror, grief as treacherous guide, memory's erosion) rather than through conflict reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency is present but quiet; the piece would benefit from a more visceral trade-off to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that purified whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias opens the vial and sends his intent, and Silas's testimony narrows Elias's existential doubt. However, the escalation is gentle: no live obstacle resists the release, and the price (vulnerability, exposure of grief) is implied rather than tested by a counter-force. The stake is won cleanly with visible emotional cost but minimal tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—navigating grief to reclaim love's essence—is signaled early and held throughout. The "reverse migration" method provides a through-line, but pressure remains static: Elara builds the device without meaningful obstacle, the phone calls deliver instructions without conflict, and the circuit completes effortlessly. The "fluctuates with moon phases" attribute is mentioned but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. No on-page tightening or deepening alters tactics; the final vision sequence delivers emotional release without visible cost or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety for Lena—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the on-page action consists of a single beat (finding the truffle) without meaningful tightening or cost; Elara faces no opposition, and the success is frictionless. The emotional weight resides entirely in past smuggling (told) and future application (envisioned), leaving the present scene without escalation or a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger's silent plea—is signaled early and pursued through the method of "observing gaps," but the investigation unfolds as a series of reflective inferences rather than a sequence of choices that narrow options or raise cost. The tightening occurs when Silas recognizes the flower as "a relic preserved for years, a burden finally set down," reweighting the gesture from mystery to release, yet this realization arrives through contemplation rather than agency under pressure. No reversals or obstacles challenge Silas's interpretation; the narrative deepens through accumulation of observed absences, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the protagonist's path remains uncontested and the cost abstract ("the weight of witnessed isolation") rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: honor the promise and find the doorway before the solstice creek swells. Time pressure (rising creek) tightens decisions on the page. The ant-following choice is a meaningful tightening that narrows options under the causal lens. However, the resolution relies on coincidental timing ("he'd arrived precisely as the water peaked") rather than protagonist agency at the closure beat. The emotional payoff—loneliness replaced by connection—is declared but the visible cost (what path was foreclosed?) is oblique. Escalation is clean until the ending mechanics soften agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: solve the dream mystery before "all light will fade." The midnight warning sets urgency, and the climb provides one tightening (breaching the cloud layer into the grotto). Inside, the bleeding starlight vision deepens understanding, reweighting her prior withdrawal as the cause. However, no on-page reversal tests commitment; luck and atmosphere deliver the revelation without protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The cost—her neglect—is conceptual and recounted, not a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows future options in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—to "capture the density of presence" in a whispered secret—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Elara's palette-mixing and light-channeling face no on-page resistance, mishap, or trade-off; she executes her plan unimpeded. Kael and Lyra's emotional arc (shame dissolving into shared vulnerability) unfolds independently of Elara's alchemy, which observes and metaphorically "affirms" rather than causally alters. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the final "revaluation" is thematically declared ("no longer defined by absence") without a visible price paid or option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—distilling mortality terror into narrative—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when Elias confronts past selves and jealousy manifests as "hot, corrosive," then deepens when the young self waves, offering connection instead of mockery. The scroll's message provides a conceptual shift rather than a decision-driven reversal; cost is felt (he remains "chronologically confused") but not a visible forfeiture that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs, sufficient for this length, though the resolution leans on discovered wisdom rather than protagonist-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore the clamp to restore trust and enable safe birth. Pressure accumulates through Elara's tactile focus, fog-occluded view, and the ticking water clocks, tightening to the screw seating with a "quiet click." The resolution—Mrs. Gable's relief—is earned by Elara's ritual care. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost reads more as emotional validation than a visible trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming scars from ruin to resilience—is signaled early and tightens when the ink crystallizes under stress. The piece delivers one meaningful pressure point: the tremor that threatens failure, forcing the shift to grandmother's superstition. Agency is clear in the choice to hold breath and shed the tear, which narrows options (scholarly method fails; emotional honesty succeeds). The cost is somewhat abstract—she must revisit childhood pain—but it forecloses the path of pure intellectual control, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—delivering the apology before the orchard's destruction severs Valerius's tether—is signaled early and tightens once through the perfume-and-music ritual. Elara's agency is visible: she chooses metaphor, uncorks the bottle, and plays the Nocturne, all actions that narrow options and foreclose the path of unspoken guilt. The cost is legible on the page: "the orchard will fall" and her "joints aching" departure mark the imperfect miracle's price. The spirit's acceptance functions as coincidence complicate rather than resolve (he grants peace; she cannot save the trees), preserving tension. No reversal per se, but the deepening—from declaration to enactment to mutual release—reads as meaningful escalation under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—unravel cosmic illusions before they become eternal law—is signaled early and pressure tightens through escalating word instability: "verity" twists to "consensus," "identity" threatens to dissolve, "existence" goes blank. Agency is exercised at each turn through spoken definitions, and the final "I am" forecloses passivity with visible conceptual cost. The hiccup's manifestation as a vortex at the precipice delivers a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and sustained. The countdown ritual provides one meaningful deepening as each number intensifies sensory and conceptual pressure, narrowing perception and forcing the shepherd toward insight. The cost is legible: his method exhausted, a path foreclosed ("He no longer needed to count backwards"). However, the escalation is largely internal and perceptual; the shepherd's agency is passive observation rather than a difficult trade-off. The ritual succeeds without visible friction or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring her father by interpreting his clues—is signaled early, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. Each clue is solved without error or cost: she simply moves from library to subway, lights the lantern, and the door appears. No reversal, no foreclosed path, no tactical sacrifice. The final scrawl on the train arrives as a gift rather than an earned discovery, and the story conflates traversing physical distance with emotional growth without dramatizing the friction between them. The conceptual stakes (lucid contradictions, perspective-widening) remain abstract; no on-page choice tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's mission to "teach endings how to begin." The caller's circular grief provides one meaningful tightening—his loop is reframed as a condition for song, and his decision to "dial anew" narrows options with a felt cost (ending the nightly ritual). Agency is present but belongs to the caller; Elara's role is facilitator, so her own escalation is muted. The cost is legible on the page ("I feel it… the space"), satisfying the lens, but the lack of a second reversal or complication and Elara's observational stance cap the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving love's small moments without being crushed by grief—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through ritual precision and memory's "haunted euphoria," and the covenant's three-part structure (original, breach, regeneration) provides one meaningful tightening. However, the tightening is more textural than a true narrowing of options; Elara faces no on-page opposition or tactical constraint that forces a trade-off. The resolution (releasing sorrow's weight) is renunciation with stated cost, but the price feels more announced ("I will tend them") than paid in a moment of visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for connection—is signaled early ("to find the cure for loneliness") and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the young woman arrives and Elara must choose whether to pass the stone. The choice narrows options (she relinquishes her anchor) and forecloses a path (no longer seeking a cure for herself). However, the escalation is shallow: no obstacle opposes Elara's decision; the woman's arrival is more validation than complication. The story lacks a live reversal or trade-off that tests commitment under pressure. Coincidence (the rumor chain) delivers the complication but does not resolve; Elara's agency drives the final act. Cost is present but muted—the stone's sentimental value is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: navigate grief to find inner peace. One meaningful deepening occurs at the stillpoint when Elara accepts love's transformation. Agency is present (she walks, touches, absorbs) but external obstacles are absent—no reversal or complication forces a trade-off. The journey is a pilgrimage of acceptance rather than a contested choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (accepting transformation) but not viscerally felt on the page; no live option is foreclosed with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (transform shame into useful wisdom) is clear early. The unbending action narrows options: physical pressure ("Metal resisted, hummed, then yielded") forces the mental shift, and the decision to carry the pen home as compass forecloses the anomaly-refuge. Cost is legible: she must face the interpreters who will inherit her warning. One tightening (the nib's straightening) drives the turn from self-blame to web-acknowledgment. Agency is hers throughout—no luck rescues. Escalation reads more as accumulative deepening than causal reversals, appropriate for the Hybrid lens dominant at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into connection—is signaled early and accumulates through the signing duet with Lily. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lily's participation transforms Elias's solitary ritual into shared witness. However, the encounter lacks friction; Lily arrives willing and fluent, offering communion without complication. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The ending modulates loneliness into hope but the cost remains abstract, not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the Heartwood Canticle to heal the poisoned valley and honor Elara—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the trail of artifacts, culminating in the vandalized portrait that encodes the melody. However, escalation is a steady accretion rather than a tightening that forecloses options; Kael encounters no meaningful obstacles, and his analytical-intuitive skill solves each puzzle without cost or tradeoff. The resolution feels assured rather than earned through a choice that narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the shared dream—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the drumming sequence as shapes coalesce then dissolve. Under the accumulative lens, the tightening occurs when "the universe exhaled" and reality's gravity pulls the dream back, forcing Kael to accept ephemerality. However, the reversal lacks a trade-off that narrows future options; the "seed of memory" and promise to return tomorrow preserve all paths, muting the cost that would enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving subtlety over force—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened. Vale's rescue unfolds as a demonstration rather than a contest with meaningful alternatives or visible cost. No on-page reversal tightens options; Kael moves with certainty and the whispering gallery solves the problem it did not help create. The "challenge" Vale posed remains abstract, never forcing Kael to choose between competing values or endure a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is Elara's burdened isolation versus release, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael weaves the shutter pattern, narrowing her options from paralysis to upward gaze. However, the escalation is driven by Kael's unilateral action rather than Elara's agency; she remains a recipient. Cost is implied (the secret dissolves) but not dramatized as a visible trade-off or forfeited alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift is present but the price lacks on-page legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts"—is signaled early and pursued through the window-display campaign. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: students craft displays, shopkeepers agree, townspeople pause and reconsider. However, no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off; the rebellion unfolds without resistance, and success arrives without visible cost. The woman's "flicker of reconsideration" and teenagers' debate demonstrate outcome but not escalation or agency-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—internal freedom via self-acceptance—is signaled early, but escalation operates primarily through reflective intensification rather than on-page reversals. The scrimshaw's "soft click" and the island's materialization arrive as rewards rather than as turns earned by Elara's agency; she surrenders and releases memories, but these acts lack visible tactical cost or foreclosed options in the present. The renunciation of violence ("refused to raise her cutlass") occurred off-page ten years prior, so the story's present conflict is largely internal and static, with the ending's transformation feeling granted by the magic object rather than forced by accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness within grief—is signaled early and tightens through the whittling ritual. The moral ambiguity of using Elara's gift as prop creates internal friction that narrows options: continue performance or accept vulnerability. The closure choice (allowing the tear, nesting the bird) forecloses the rigid mask with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each shaving and narrated phrase advances the redistribution of grief's weight until the turbine shadow cycle crystallizes acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—stride through boundaries once thought sacred—is signaled early but unfolds without on-page opposition or cost. Each paraphrase softens the boundary "exactly as the poet had envisioned," eliminating friction rather than escalating it. No reversal, complication, or meaningful tightening occurs; the method works perfectly on first attempt, and the resolution is declared fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest for beauty in imperfection, Kael's need to move past his perceived failures—is signaled early and tightens through their exchange. The reversal occurs when Kael hears Elara reframe his "failure" glass as "beautiful because it is true," shifting his perception. However, the escalation is gentle: no competing pressures threaten the barter, no cost is risked if either refuses. The exchange succeeds on first attempt without complication. Agency is present (both choose to engage, to offer their awakenings), but the lack of friction—no moment where the barter might collapse, no trade-off where one must surrender something precious to gain insight—keeps pressure modest and prevents entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection"—is signaled early but remains conceptual rather than tested by live opposition. Elara's prism-song causes sensors to flicker and flatline, yet this apparent failure resolves instantly into success (the Resonator hums, the melody emerges) without a visible trade-off or a tightening that narrows options. Dr. Aris's skepticism collapses into "awe" without dramatized resistance, erasing the escalation path. No on-page cost forecloses a path or alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose after loss—is signaled early, and the discovery of the grove provides a meaningful deepening that narrows Elara's options from paralysis to committed action. However, the escalation is driven by Lena's off-page work rather than Elara's present choices under pressure; the bioluminescent grove is a revelation, not a reversal forced by protagonist agency. The final workshop scene shows renewed commitment, but no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path accompanies the return to work.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural adaptation post-collapse—is signaled early and maintained. Leo's arrival provides one tightening when Elara confides her method, showing him his own choices reflected. However, no reversal narrows live options or imposes a visible trade-off; the encounter deepens understanding without cost. Coincidence (Leo arrives because his father was helped) complicates without resolving, but the ending restores equilibrium rather than foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—purify the atoms to spare her people from the Aethel's collapse—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the core atom (council chamber) appears and Elara's "own innocence fractured," forcing her to hold anguish and joy simultaneously. The escalation is causal under the Accumulative lens (pattern-breaking leap to levity, then the hardest memory) but happens in a single compressed beat; no prior complication tests her method or threatens failure. The cost is felt (grief for truths lost, joy for wisdom won) and visible in her tears, but the purification succeeds without setback, which caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope's shape versus allowing its evolution—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's archive work. However, escalation is passive: she observes footage rather than making tactical choices that narrow options under live resistance. The shadow's "gentle catalyst" nature is discovered, not confronted, so the reversal lacks agency-driven pressure. The cost (surrendering her belief in stasis) is legible but arrives through realization rather than a decision that forecloses a path with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion after betrayal—is signaled early. However, escalation occurs almost entirely through Elara's internal monologue rather than on-page reversals or tightening choices that narrow options. The shedding of layers is a symbolic sequence, not a pressure-driven conflict where wants collide with costs. No external opposition or complication tests her resolve; Dr. Aris is already unmasked before the story begins, so the "con revealed at dusk" functions as backstory rather than a live reversal. The ending reconfigures meaning (tail tip becomes talisman, trust will regenerate) but does so through declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a prior path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's drive to decipher scars and find closure. The piece deepens understanding via plant-transmitted memories (broken frond, buried acorn), but there is no on-page reversal or choice under competing pressure—Elara receives insight passively. The "tightening" is conceptual reweighting rather than narrowed options or a trade-off with visible cost. No antagonist or obstacle forces agency; the escalation is textural accumulation rather than protagonist-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to find where unused love is stored. The piece deepens rather than escalates through external conflict; pressure accumulates via sensory immersion and emotional architecture until the vision yields its answer. The cost is conceptual and relational—Clara's unrequited love preserved in celluloid, Elara's acceptance of release as mercy—legible in the final image. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening (the vision's climax) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) is signaled early and pressure coheres through the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when remembered pain floods back and Elara recognizes the cage as self-made. However, escalation is passive: each meteor traced delivers memory rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The climactic "rest" is a surrender to insight rather than an active choice with visible cost, and coincidence (the aurora's timing, meteors appearing on cue) facilitates the resolution. No persistent constraint visibly alters tactics; the astrolabe and archway enable the ritual but impose no friction or price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: cultivate sparks in unlit corners. The story offers one meaningful tightening when the guard's consciousness expands "occasionally everywhere" (line 222), glimpsing alternate timelines, then anchors back to the present. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on iterative moves (walk, kneel, hum, nurture) without a trade-off or visible price that narrows later options. The final blooming is fulfillment rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (emptied mind, dreamlessness) but not dramatized as a live friction in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled (restore harmony via the missing gear), but escalation is absent. Kael walks unimpeded to the tree, inserts the gear, and experiences triumph without on-page cost or contested choice. No reversal tightens options; the wind-listening method yields an "auditory map pointing unerringly" with no false lead or tactical adjustment. Agency is minimal: the forest guides, the socket matches, success is declarative. Pressure never coheres into a moment where Kael must forfeit or endure to achieve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake ("find unused courage") is signaled early but never tightened through a trade-off or narrowed option. The journey is a guided tour with no reversal, live decision, or price paid on the page. Elara remains passive; the guides control all movement and deliver the resolution as exposition. Coincidence (guides appear, lead, reveal, vanish) drives every beat, violating the lens requirement that protagonist agency shape escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety and atoning for her silence—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Elara presses the stone, risking exposure; the discovery of the bolt deepens her understanding and forces the final trade-off: perpetuate silence or remain present with guilt. The resolution is earned by her decision to mount the bolt and open the chamber, with visible cost (ongoing nerve pain as compass, permanent vulnerability). Agency is clear: decision and endurance that foreclose the path of easy routine. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Kael's voice is memory, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—unmasking Valerius—is signaled early but never tightens on the page. Kael's method (cryptic messages) operates in summary across centuries without a single beat where a tactical choice narrows options or imposes felt cost. The courtroom reversal happens off-stage and is recounted rather than dramatized, undercutting escalation. Elara's intervention, not Kael's agency, triggers the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering why ecological pathways disappeared—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elara's tapping ritual and the appearance of the AI overlay, but escalation lacks a live choice under duress: the video unlocks automatically, and her shift to "cultivating remembrance" involves no visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative. The final image reweights her solitary grief into archival purpose, a meaningful deepening, yet the protagonist's agency at closure is observational rather than decisional. One tightening (sacred rhythm → video reveal) narrows knowledge but not options.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in shattered rebellion—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through textural density and the hum's intensification rather than causal reversals. Kael's agency is renunciation: he rejects vengeance in favor of "thunderous serenity," a stance crystallization that forecloses the path of armed resistance. The cost is conceptual and felt—abandoning shouts for story—but legible in the final image. One tightening (approaching the stones, feeling the hum cleanse despair) is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reconstruction needs roots now, and Elara refuses passive waiting. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glyphs reveal the unseal method, narrowing her options. However, escalation is lean—no reversal or compounding obstacle tests her resolve between discovery and action. The choice to unseal carries thematic weight but no visible on-page cost (loss of status, resource, safety) that alters later tactics. Agency is present but the decision arc is smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—sustaining the pearl of stillness amid grief—is signaled early and threads the entire piece. Pressure is static; the gull's cry triggers the freeze-to-grounding sequence, but this is practice, not test. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a path; Elara performs her method without facing a cost that alters her options. The child's laughter at the end observes resilience rather than proving it through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore reality's weave and his artistic purpose—is signaled early and tightens when walls press inward. One meaningful turn: Kael's decision to descend and untangle threads, driven by his own agency, narrows options and forecloses avoidance. The escalation is visible: fracture → pressure → descent → redesign → restoration. Cost is legible in the act of "acknowledging each" strand of shame and "embracing necessary darkness," though the resolution feels somewhat smooth. The rhetorical questions serve as a focusing device but occasionally substitute for direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the eclipse's temporal mystery—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ink patterns echo the crisis-dust, forcing Kael to activate the drone and witness its disappearance. The cost is visible (drone lost, door closed), though the escalation is more accumulative than driven by protagonist agency testing competing goods; Kael observes and accepts rather than wrestles with a dilemma that forces a trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: truth versus complicity. One clear tightening: Kael's footsteps force the transmission. However, the reversal feels coincidental rather than driven by Elara's prior choices, and the cost is abstract ("no longer merely a keeper") rather than a visible forfeiture. "Bravely conflicted" is asserted but the on-page moment compresses decision into a single thumb-press without layering want versus fear. The ending reconfigures her stance with conceptual weight, but the physical act (transmit, seal panel, lie) happens too smoothly without tactical struggle or visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming violence into sanctuary—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs: the knife ritual (draw, feel history, sheathe with vow) performed each dawn, which the text presents as a daily foreclosure of violence. However, that ritual is recounted rather than dramatized with live temptation or counterpressure in this scene; no reversal or on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options within the window. The piece accumulates texture but lacks an event that tests commitment with visible cost scaled to the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and tightens once: Elara's shift from pursuit to receptivity at the vortex narrows options and forecloses the original goal with visible cost (she does not capture, but opens). The escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens: shattered C-major, cacophony surge, thorny dissonance all pressure her method until the vortex crystallizes the choice. Agency is present (driving the spike, voicing perfect silence), though coincidence plays a role (sleepwalking constellations pausing). One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length; cost is felt but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—discovering hidden truths about Alistair's death—is signaled early and drives archival investigation. Pressure tightens through accumulating contradictions (locked shutter, false frost claim, personalized nib clue), and the grandfather's journal entry provides a meaningful reversal that reframes accident as staged contrition. However, escalation lacks visible cost: Elara never faces a choice between competing goods, no resource or relationship is sacrificed, and the decision to publish arrives without dramatized resistance or trade-off. The investigation proceeds too smoothly, with each clue falling neatly into place and no tactical price paid for pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of guilt—is clear and present throughout. However, escalation is thin: Elara discovers the letters, reads the prescription, and follows it without complication, failed attempt, or mid-course adaptation. The humming "translation" constitutes a single meaningful action, but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The cost is asserted ("hard-won understanding") rather than shown as a trade-off that narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in emotional chaos—is signaled early and deepens through the mandala's construction. The tile flake whisper ("The weight is gone") provides one tightening that narrows her resolve to interject. The anxious "What remains?" whisper is a clear reversal that threatens the fragile peace, forcing Elara's decisive word "Integrate" and deepening the hush with "gentle authority." Agency is visible in her choice to speak rather than remain silent. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than a sharp trade-off or visible price paid in the moment—her action succeeds without clear cost beyond the impermanence lesson, which feels thematic rather than immediately felt.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming communal memory from "shroud" to sanctuary—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens when Elara kneels, reads the chipped patterns, and inscribes the new name, narrowing her options from passive caretaking to active renaming. The survivors' label "aberrant mercy" and the elders' muttered resistance provide atmospheric opposition, but no on-page antagonist forces a trade-off or escalates cost. The tessera embedding and the children's laughter gesture toward consequence, yet the "profound release" and the resolution of her retrocognitive trap arrive as told summary rather than a visible price paid through forfeited safety, social capital, or immediate backlash.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the duet's possibility—is signaled early, but no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. Elara executes her method (producing echoes, braiding them) without setback, adaptation, or cost that alters tactics. The "brink of despair" is a declared threat never dramatized; Julian's light coalesces because she wills it, not through a choice that forecloses another path. The closing dissolution is framed as fulfillment rather than sacrifice with felt price. Pressure remains static; coincidence (the orchard "responds") enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring Maya's need for connection—is signaled early but never faces a legible trade-off or complication that forces Elara to choose between competing goods. The light painting sequence proceeds without reversal, obstacle, or failed attempt; somatic cues guide her smoothly to success. The telepathy pill recall and static shock are set up as constraints but do not narrow options on the page—they enable rather than complicate. Closure cost (keeping the geode, filing the notice) is conceptual and subtle, but the path to that cost lacks a visible tightening or choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—ensuring sleepers awaken to a remembered world—is signaled early and remains coherent. The fossil encounter provides one meaningful deepening (validation through "light and motion"), and the map's transformation shows escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page choice narrows live options or imposes a visible trade-off; Elara encounters no resistance, resource constraint, or competing demand. The decision to leave the fossil for "future seekers" rather than deliver it directly to the cryo-chambers is presented as natural continuation rather than a dilemma with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming a fatalistic prophecy into collective possibility—is signaled early and coherent under the Accumulative lens. The ceiling crack provides one beat of physical pressure that deepens focus ("did not flinch"), and the button-mosaic assembly constitutes a meaningful tightening as chaotic fragments resolve into testimony. Yet escalation is density-driven rather than choice-constrained; Elara never faces a forced trade-off or renunciation, and the mosaic's "visual argument" emerges through cataloging mechanics without a prior live option being foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to "fix what was broken" by vouchsafing his truth—is signaled early, but escalation operates through accumulation of mood and motif rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. Anya's arrival is a reversal, yet it does not generate new friction; instead, the story moves from solitude to shared understanding without an on-page trade-off or foreclosed path. The pillbox exchange ("the most prudently daring act of his life") is asserted but not tested by opposing force or internal contradiction that forces a visible price. The closure reads as mutual acceptance rather than a decision under pressure with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—distilling the palimpsest promise before the rain stops—is signaled early and coheres. The ticking serves as a time constraint that tightens the meditation. The deepening occurs through memory percolation: each recollection (Elara's hands, the mine's closure, lullabies in dim rooms) reweights the promise from geographic failure to spiritual thread. The final beat (needle pressed, ferry boarded) forecloses the literal hope with felt cost. However, the escalation is entirely internal; no external pressure complicates or tests the resolution, and the convenient lifting of fog at the moment of clarity softens the earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the oasis's resistance—is signaled early and sustained. The escalation under an Accumulative lens is the thrum/vision that deepens Kael's knowledge and reweights his purpose. His final choice (to carry sharp gentleness into the wasteland) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of passive study. The cost is felt but remains abstract: no live tactical dilemma or visible forfeiture of a second option in the moment, limiting entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—casting light into darkness as an act of witness—is signaled early and maintained. The piece provides one meaningful deepening when Mateo's reaction validates Elara's effort, but no true reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The ritual proceeds without obstacle or trade-off; the cost (shoulder fatigue, next season's wait) is present but mild, never forcing a harder choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—coexisting with Kaelen's memories without being consumed—is signaled early and narrows through the sundial ritual. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: mounting memory fragments deepen until the circle's hum triggers full immersion, forcing Elara to choose stewardship over passive isolation. Agency is present (carrying the sundial, inscribing the chronicle) and forecloses a path (remaining silent). Cost is visible (continued isolation, responsibility as witness) but not sharply embodied at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for connection—is signaled early and tightened when she decides to create the installation, a choice that moves her from passive observation to public vulnerability. The accumulation of visitor offerings (crane, forget-me-not, blue stone) deepens the installation's charge and validates her method, culminating in her own secret as the final act. However, the escalation is smooth and uncontested; no reversal or obstacle tests her commitment, and the visitors' immediate participation removes friction. The cost—her solitude replaced by kinship—is conceptually present but not felt as a trade-off or sacrifice in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—stop the tricksters' discord—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs: Croft's memo escalates institutional pressure, forcing Aris to bypass filters and act despite consequence. The broadcast succeeds, and the quad calms with visible cost (Croft's footsteps, inevitable termination). However, the turn is not driven by Aris's agency under live pressure; it is executed per a pre-planned alignment with no surprise, adaptation, or complication. The stakes are declared cosmic yet resolved through a single technical act that faces no mid-scene friction, reducing felt escalation. Cost is legible but modest for the scale claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the Chronos Key to end the fallow period—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the walls close in, forcing Elara to choose between retreat (condemning her village) and climbing into the claustrophobic loft. Her agency (playing the organ) directly causes the spatial mutiny to resolve and reveals the key. The cost is legible: she must confront her deepest fear to succeed, and the text confirms "she remained claustrophobic, would always carry that shadow." However, the escalation is somewhat thin—one major pressure point rather than a deepening series—and the organ's mechanics arrive via convenient journal fragment rather than prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—remembering Clara beyond a faded photograph—is signaled early. The discovery tightens when the hairline seam reveals the journal, but the shift from "cold case" to "freedom from a gilded cage" is Clara's choice, not Elara's, so escalation lacks protagonist agency at the turn. The resolution rests on Elara's realization and vow to return with the unified story, which is a stance crystallization (fits Accumulative lens) but carries only abstract future cost ("promise carried forward") rather than a present price paid or option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving Aris's bravery and reversing his exile—is signaled early and tightens when the decoded warning reveals immediate danger. Elara's agency drives both the historical revelation and the evacuation decision, narrowing options under pressure. The technician's seismic cross-reference provides a micro turn that validates her proof and forces the evacuation. Cost is legible: the station is destroyed, and Elara's isolation transforms into purpose with visible consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming music after twenty years of silence—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: the hitchhiker vanishes, Elias reflects, then decides to play without meaningful opposition or tightening. The "wave of luminous disbelief" and subsequent understanding feel like epiphanic gifts rather than choices under pressure. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the resolution arrives through contemplation, not agency that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Leo's quest to understand recursive failure—is signaled early but remains largely reflective rather than tested by immediate pressure. Kai's arrival introduces a secondary beat where Leo can dissuade, yet the encounter unfolds as instruction, not conflict; Leo's calm authority goes unchallenged. The story offers a deepening via the historical parallels (father/circus/startup), but escalation is missing—no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The decision to leave the currency is framed as liberation but carries no legible sacrifice or foreclosed path in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the final temple inscription—is signaled early and tightens through months of failed correlation, fatigue, and the sense of solitary burden. Kael's telegram and the memory of the daylily glyph shift Elara's understanding, narrowing her interpretive lens to "the space between the star's breaths" and enabling the final insight. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes the inscriptions celebrate shared vigilance, not lone mastery. The cost is conceptual (renouncing her "stubborn isolation") and the stakes are intellectual rather than urgent external peril, which fits the accumulative lens but limits visceral pressure. No visible forfeiture of a live option or resource appears on the page, capping escalation below the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: unveil the hidden truth (frozen confession) and heal the curse. The scrying failure in the opening beat establishes a problem, and Elara's choice to plant the seed and chant initiates a new tactic. Pressure accumulates through expanding circles rather than through reversals or narrowing options; the plant grows and consumes corruption without complication or setback. The confession's reveal—her own cowardice—introduces internal cost, yet no live option is foreclosed on the page; she kneels, chants, the plant works, ice melts, she apologizes, and walks away unbent. The resolution feels patient and inevitable rather than tested by a tightening that forces a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but lacks a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge or reweights the dominant stake with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mend the eclipsed covenant—is signaled in paragraph five. Pressure accumulates as Elara links through scars, each connection a "painful cartography." The clipping's transformation from key to seed provides one meaningful turn. Yet escalation lacks a moment where a live option is foreclosed or a competing desire forces a trade-off; the path from oak to clearing to rift proceeds without obstacle or adaptation. The final act (pressing clipping into rift, pouring scars) resolves without Elara losing anything concrete or making a choice between competing goods. Cost is asserted ("forgiven pain") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring Elara's peace and mending the bartered destiny—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through Kael's ritual acts (placing the petal, tracing symbols, recounting memories), and the wisp's appearance introduces a micro-turn that allows the barter to complete. The final absorption of sorrow is agency (willing acceptance) with visible cost ("cold sorrow flooded the hole in his chest"). However, the escalation is largely ceremonial; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off before the resolution. The ritual proceeds as planned without a moment where Kael must choose between competing goods or face a complication that alters tactics. Cost is legible at closure, but the path there lacks a tightening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Leo seeks purpose after public humiliation. However, escalation is internal and largely reflective; no external pressure tightens options on the page. The "tightening" is a solo epiphany—opening the box, remembering Akron, deciding to write—without a live antagonist, competing desire, or visible trade-off that narrows paths. The decision to "abandon auction houses" and become a chronicler is stated rather than tested with on-page cost, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand the physics of transition to resolve grief over Elara. Pressure tightens when "despair threatened to swallow him whole" after the failed observation, then shifts via analogical thinking to a new hypothesis. The planting is an agency-driven choice (renunciation of retrieval, embrace of connection) that forecloses the retrieval path with visible cost (thirty years' ambition, tears). The arbor's stabilization and green shoot promise validate the new stance. One meaningful tightening is present, sufficient for this length. Minor issue: the turn from despair to insight compresses slightly, and the external validation (arbor hum, console needles) arrives quickly, softening the struggle slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled: "preserve wonder in routine." The smelting of contradictory fragments offers a single meaningful action, but pressure never tightens—no fragment resists fusion, no cost narrows options. The desert and memory shards resolve instantly through Elara's verbal acceptance with no struggle, foreclosed path, or felt price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening would suffice, but here the act is repeated without escalation or complication. No reversal or tightening alters tactics or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—dissolving walls between hearts, beginning with his own—is signaled early and tightened when the shell's confessions mirror Elias's unspoken regrets, forcing him into the "heartbeat of a hesitation" choice. The placement act forecloses solitary burden-carrying with visible cost (releasing the pearl). However, the choice reads more as thematic inevitability than a dramatized tension between competing goods; no live alternative path receives on-page weight during the decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness for silence during father's final weeks) is clear from the opening. One meaningful tightening: the graffiti wisdom forces Elara to abandon her map-based methodology and accept forgiveness as embodied practice rather than charted destination. The accordion's patched bellows introduce visible cost—she vowed restoration but carries permanent neglect. However, escalation relies on externally delivered wisdom (graffiti) rather than protagonist-driven pressure, reducing agency. The final act (leaving the map, shouldering the accordion) crystallizes stance with felt cost, meeting RR closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—to document the library's ephemeral script—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through a reversal. No on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off; Elara documents without friction, and the library "responds" passively to her apology. The resolution—speaking her first word aloud—is not earned by prior agency; the watch chimes and the library glows brighter, but no visible price is paid. Coincidence (the library's glow, the watch's synchronization) facilitates rather than complicates, violating the lens rule that coincidence may complicate but not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (dream vs. empire) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee-stain prophecy reveals the binary outcome, narrowing options. Elara's agency drives the climax: her choice to draw the bow sacrifices the artifact and fulfills the seed's propagation, foreclosing the Archive path with visible cost (violin destroyed, tears shed). The pressure reads coherent under the Hybrid lens, though the coffee prophecy delivers the fork passively rather than through a struggle that forces the weighing. Cost is legible on the page ("sorrow rich as crushed berries").

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake—capturing Kael's essence before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. The threshold moment provides a single meaningful tightening when the mandala snaps into focus and the aurora stills, forcing Elara to act. However, no live obstacle or choice complicates her path; the ritual proceeds as planned without error, refusal, or cost beyond the passage of time. Agency is present in the infusion act but unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment through forgiveness—is signaled early and the ritual provides one meaningful tightening. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is limited: the tree climb and carving proceed without opposition, complication, or visible trade-off. Elara's choice to "release the final shards of resentment" is declared in interiority rather than tested by an on-page reversal or cost that forecloses an option. No antagonist or friction materializes to force a harder stance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kael's release from guilt—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The escalation proceeds through chime interpretation, dialogue turns, and the physical acts of unhooking and releasing, creating one meaningful tightening. However, the opposition is entirely internal and symbolic; no setback or complication tests Kael's commitment before the release. The wind chimes shift obligingly to reflect each thematic beat, functioning more as narrative confirmation than earned reversal. Cost is visible (cloak gone, shard dropped) but the emotional price lacks friction—Kael's resistance dissolves on cue.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: to crystallize the lesson of vanishing/appearing for future students. The trance ritual provides coherent situational pressure, and the final image (pond stilled, purpose clarified) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is minimal—Aris enters the trance with resolve and exits with confirmation rather than a choice that narrows options. The cost (another day reversed, Elara's memory fading) is present but static; no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. Agency reads as observation and endurance rather than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and drives one meaningful deepening: the flock's split reveals the Pulse is bifurcated, not lost, forcing Corbin to shift from seeking direction to becoming integration. Agency is present (he hums the First Song), but the turn feels more like enacting a solution than wrestling with a dilemma. The cost (remaining seated, becoming the anchor) is legible but contemplative; there's no on-page trade-off or foreclosed alternative that narrows options under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the keystone—is signaled early and tightens when Elara reaches the archway and realizes the artifact is "a testament, not a trophy." Her agency manifests as renunciation: she leaves the keystone, an Earned Stasis that forecloses the guild's path and accepts social cost (remaining branded underachieving). One meaningful deepening occurs when she unstraps shame and expectations, pouring in simple memories; this gesture reweights the task from humiliation to pilgrimage. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density of image and memory accumulates rather than causal reversals. The cost is conceptual (defying guild, planting seed) and legible, though the visceral price (hunger, exile, guild reprisal) remains implicit rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering proof of luminous vows—is signaled early and pursued consistently, but pressure never meaningfully tightens or complicates. Elias seeks, finds, and understands without reversal or trade-off; the logbook delivers exactly the evidence he hoped for with no friction. The claimed escalation (sky lanterns ascending, tears breaking his defensive walls) is told rather than tested through a decision that forecloses an option. Agency at closure is passive recognition rather than a choice that alters tactics or costs. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens would require the discovery to impose a visible price or reweight his next move; neither occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to find purpose/alignment in a concluded universe. The coin-casting and static-listening deepen her understanding but do not narrow options or force a trade-off; the Xylosian disc's balanced stance and the "resonant frequency of acceptance" confirm rather than alter her trajectory. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path. The "stellar doubt" is present but softens without on-page cost—no renunciation, no visible loss. Agency is attention and ritual endurance, valid under the Accumulative lens, but pressure does not escalate to a choice with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—to give names to nameless fears and honor Elara's sacrifice—is signaled early and sustained. Each crystallization constitutes a micro-escalation under the accumulative lens, with the void-beast as the deepest fear creating a single meaningful tightening. However, the sequence reads more as ritual progression than true reversals or contested choices; Kael encounters no failure, resistance, or trade-off that threatens the outcome. The cost at closure (tears, gathering all light) is visible but the path feels preordained rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance by mending the bell—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: Elara sets up her conduit and watches; no reversal, complication, or forced trade-off tightens pressure mid-story. The climax (bell rings, fish leaps) arrives through accumulation rather than a decision that narrows options, and no visible price is paid in the ending moment itself—her tears and acknowledgment of future work are reflective rather than a forfeited path or immediate cost. The "plausible impossibility" conceit means opposition is implicit (elders' ridicule, 73 prior dawns) but never dramatized on the page, leaving agency as patient observation rather than active choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring memory versus bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early. The directive to "expunge all personal artifacts" provides potential friction, but Elara never faces a live choice between compliance and defiance; her decision to rescue the bottle is her default position from the opening. The piece deepens her understanding (liqueur = loss → liqueur = courage lesson) but does not tighten options or impose visible cost. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is present (the grief memory), but no tactic shifts or consequences land on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (harmonizing logic and intuition) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure is declared ("frustration tightened her throat") but not dramatized—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic fails and forces adaptation. The starlings provide a solution without Elara testing and rejecting alternatives first; coincidence delivers the resolution. The copper wire weaving is a single graceful act without visible struggle or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is minimally present (frustration → epiphany), but agency is weak and the tightening lacks causal teeth. No credible loss (time, material, error) alters her tactics or charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure by ensuring accurate pattern reports—is signaled early and tightens once: the Serpent constellation's wrongness forces the revision choice. The erroneous log entry creates a credible problem, and the revision act forecloses the path of convenience (leaving flawed data). Cost is visible in the physical act of crossing out coordinates and the emotional weight of the tear. However, the escalation is somewhat linear; the static clears early, and the middle consists mostly of observation and memory rather than a second pressure point that narrows options further.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is defeating numbness; secondary is the custody battle (quickly dismissed). Kaela's placement of palms on glass and her spoken acceptance constitute the sole visible escalation beat—but this move meets no resistance and triggers immediate success (fluid glows, warmth floods). No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The resolution arrives through declaration and metaphor rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and pressured through the ritual. The sound experiment deepens when the echo returns Clara's voice, narrowing the void into acknowledgment. However, escalation is linear: Elias performs the ritual, hears the ghost, and stops; no competing choice or visible trade-off alters his tactics. The parents' distant response suggests change, but Elias himself does not forfeit or refuse an alternative path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to cross the threshold and end exile—is signaled early and tightens when the rift opens. The guardian's agency manifests in the choice to release the pendant, foreclosing the return with on-page cost (the friendship betrayed, the vigil abandoned). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the situational lens, and the price is visible in the gesture and the interiority. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the extended post-choice reflection risks diluting the peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (transform the crozier, interrupt destiny) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the surrender-to-listening beat, then the creative-destruction realization narrows her approach from repair to vivification. The final transformation forecloses the path of servitude with visible cost (weeks of labor, blood, emotional investment). Weakness: the escalation is contemplative rather than agonistic—no external obstacle or internal doubt complicates the final sequence once the epiphany lands, reducing friction in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the beginning in every ending—is signaled early and sustained. The escalation unfolds as a deepening (discarding assumptions one by one) rather than a causal tightening, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the sequence of releases feels more like a checklist than a series of choices with rising cost. The receiver's transformation and the fragment's glow offer a tonal shift, but the stakes do not narrow options or force a trade-off with legible price. Agency is present in the act of tuning and discarding, yet the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—merge timelines, restore passengers to safety—is signaled early and drives Leo's actions. However, escalation is minimal: Leo encounters the anomaly, enters the grotto, intuits the solution, and succeeds without setback, trade-off, or a narrowing of options. The radio's temporal echoes and clock's sideways spin complicate atmosphere but do not force a choice or reversal. The ending delivers a solve rather than a cost-laden tightening; passengers remain "unaware," so relational or social consequence is absent. One meaningful tightening (anomaly forces solve) is present but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs during the eruption when "the boundary between the realistically imaginary and the painfully real dissolved," forcing Elara into immersion rather than analysis. However, the tightening is delivered by the pattern's autonomous action ("threads writhed with fierce autonomy") rather than Elara's agency; she tries to "reinforce the rational structure" but is overridden. Cost clarity is moderate: she kneels and gathers threads with tears, yet no specific tactical option or relationship is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning celestial navigation underwater using alien methods—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs: the hologram's superimposition of iron geometry onto star chart demonstrates the method's validity, transforming student doubt into engagement. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than pressured by competing options or visible cost; Kael never risks failure, nor does the demonstration impose a trade-off. The "arduous path to the surface" is declared but not tested on the page, so the price remains abstract rather than felt in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is signaled early (protect Arthur's voice before it dissolves). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara isolates the faint pulse and decodes the message, which enables the assurance to Lily. Yet the escalation is linear and frictionless: no reversal, no live option foreclosed, no visible price. Coincidence (the social worker arriving "as if summoned") delivers Lily precisely when needed, and Elara's success fortifies the atrium without cost—a net gain that undercuts felt pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—to witness and validate his grandfather's erased work—is signaled immediately and drives every beat. Pressure tightens through environmental escalation (narrowing corridors, serpent of claustrophobia, rising tide) and Aris's agency: he chooses to descend, aligns the gold fleck deliberately, activates the Array, and leaves the codex as beacon. The frost-script message delivers a meaningful deepening that reweights the grandfather's legacy and Aris's purpose. Cost is visible: near-death escape, permanent loss of the codex, fifty years of erasure acknowledged but not reversed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"fetch wisdom from failure"—is declared but never dramatized as a choice that narrows options. The ink ritual unfolds without resistance, reversal, or visible trade-off; Elara discovers "the failure was human, not malicious" without on-page friction or cost. The heartbeat count climbs (219, 287, 340) but this escalation is decorative, not causal. No antagonistic pressure forces a renunciation or forecloses a live path. The "digital ghost dissolved" is summary, not a turn earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the Old Tongue before it vanishes—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through sixty dawns of observation, tactile mapping, and the convergence of flock patterns with diamond flaws, tightening toward the single culminating word. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the diamond warms and the curse reveals itself as a lock awaiting its key, narrowing options and raising the cost of mistranslation. Agency is exercised through deliberate micro-choices (matching ridge to click, hollow to hum, fracture to consonant sequence), and the final placement of the diamond in the niche forecloses return with conceptual cost. However, no live option is dramatized as foreclosed on the page; the resolution feels assured rather than tested by competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Aris's mission versus her emerging wonder—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, the metamorphosis itself is witnessed passively; Aris makes no on-page choice that narrows her options or imposes trade-offs until the final decision, which arrives without prior tactical friction. The piece provides one meaningful deepening (the moment her skepticism fractures) but lacks a reversal or tightening that forces Aris to forfeit something concrete. The cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reawaken beauty versus mechanical control—is signaled early and escalates when statues crack, forcing Elara to descend and uproot. The peak choice (uprooting vines despite pain) narrows options and the orchard's rebirth constitutes a visible outcome. However, the escalation feels more atmospheric than tactical: no credible loss (time, stamina, social credit) alters her approach mid-story. The golden glow and monolith's shatter arrive as fulfillment rather than hard-won reversal, keeping the score in the solid but not exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—fostering connection across the border by smuggling letters—is signaled early. The patrol drone's appearance provides one pressure point, and Kael's use of the thunderstorm bottle constitutes a tightening (he must act now or abort). However, the escalation lacks immediate consequence: the drone "retreats into shadows" without pursuit, injury, or discovery, so the cost remains abstract. The resolution (drone launched, parcels dropped, Kael walks away) is executed by Kael but does not foreclose a live option or trade off a visible resource. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens thematic weight but does not dramatize a price that alters tactics or stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elara's internal paralysis (silence as void vs. possibility). Pressure accumulates through discovery, memory of Lily, and the halo fragment's "latent memory," tightening to the decision to sing. One meaningful turn: singing breaks twelve years of silence and "mends brass and soul alike." Agency is present (she chooses to sing, to place the fragment, to return tomorrow) with visible cost (shaking frame, voice unused for twelve years). Escalation is textural—density and sensory detail increase—but the magical responsiveness of the halo and horse (glowing, eyes softening) resolves the repair without requiring a second difficult choice. The coincidental "wrong turn" complicates setup but does not resolve, so situational allowance applies.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: to locate where stories truly live. The tightening occurs when Elara moves from broad search to the specific method (hyperbolic geometry + scarf alignment, lines 92–109), and the deepening arrives when the memory fuses present understanding with the grandmother's teaching (line 181). This reweights the diagram from metaphor to map, narrowing Elara's search to an internal answer. However, the escalation is cerebral; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or raises external cost. The story delivers one meaningful pressure point under the Accumulative lens, but the final choice—to "carry the library within"—feels more like acceptance than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: capturing the dream's essence to end a decade of longing. Pressure tightens when Elara climbs the turret with her precise saffron-moonstone blend, frames the horizon, and confronts "luminous absence" before the shutter click. The photograph's unexpected result—arched window instead of courtyard—constitutes one meaningful reversal that narrows her understanding and transforms her goal from literal recovery to acceptance of internal peace. Agency is present (she blends, climbs, frames, presses the shutter), and the cost is felt: she forecloses the hunt for the external courtyard. However, the resolution leans on epiphany ("recognition," "quiet understanding") rather than a harder trade-off or renunciation with sharper on-page friction. Escalation under Accumulative lens is credible but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is declared early but remains conceptual and never tightens into a trade-off or live risk. The locksmith faces no resistance: the fear "recoils, confused" on cue, and the seal dissolves without complication. No reversal or deepening alters options; the narrative moves through ritual steps (untie ribbon, angle hair, speak words, press into fracture) in predictable sequence. Agency is cosmetic—the protagonist performs rather than chooses under pressure. Cost is asserted (Elara's tear, the now-dull hair) but not felt; the locksmith walks away unchanged, and no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs in a focused causal sequence: journal → travel → method → alignment → memory return → closure gesture. Aris's agency lies in choosing to return, executing the detection ritual, and offering thanks by releasing the mushroom, each step narrowing options (he cannot un-remember once the alignment succeeds). The price is clear: thirty-two years of avoidance must be confronted, and the recovered memory reveals Elara's sacrifice, reweighting his past with "not grief, but profound release." One beat of escalation and one visible cost meet the 600–800 word standard cleanly under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reversing Elara's exile—is signaled early and tightens once through the tea-leaf reading, which transforms her skepticism into tentative hope and narrows her options to accepting the annotation method or remaining passive. The tightening is driven by Kael's guided demonstration and Elara's agency in tracing the spiral and inscribing "Return." Cost is partial: Kael's forward step forecloses his habitual retreat, but Elara's emotional or relational price (what she risks by hoping) is asserted rather than dramatized. No explicit antagonist; pressure coheres through Elara's internal resistance and Kael's modeling.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder's color—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or tradeoff. The visualization sequence unfolds without friction: she gathers strands, weaves them, channels them into the seed, all succeeding in linear steps. No reversal or deepening narrows options; planting at noon is announced as future certainty. The tear and "quiet triumph" label closure as emotionally significant but no visible price alters her tactics or forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled immediately and tightens through each knot's revelation, culminating in the fisherman's sacrificial choice that forces Elara to confront her own fractures. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the secret began to unfold across the sharing of this memory" and intensifies at the final knot. Cost is legible: Elara's defensive posture as a "restorer of broken masks" is foreclosed in favor of "weaver of solace," and her tears mark the emotional price. Agency is consistent—her choice to speak truths and unravel knots drives each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting the map's tear and the silence it represents—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: frame-by-frame comparison reveals shadow divergence, which reweights the vault-henge relationship. Agency is attention and interpretation rather than overt decision; Elara's choice to publish "quietly" and frame discovery as stewardship carries conceptual cost but no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through discovery density, but the lack of a live constraint or price that alters tactics keeps this in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Aris seeking to understand letting go—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the descent, tape untangling, and audio playback, deepening when Evans' words echo Elara's final transmission. The tightening occurs at closure when observation (snow globe particles settling) reweights his stance. However, the escalation is more textural than causal: no on-page opposition or failed attempt forces a trade-off. The forty-minute tape restoration is told in summary (line 168) rather than dramatized with friction. Cost is present but muted—emotional shift without a visible forfeiture of action or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs before thunder arrives—is signaled early. The timeframe ("fragile space between lightning and thunder") creates a window, but no on-page moment shows Elara racing against it or choosing which symbols to prioritize under that pressure. The sequence of carvings reads as a catalog rather than escalating choices; each symbol is named without friction or cost. Elara's agency is execution of a pre-formed plan, not decision under pressure. The ending asserts transformation ("world subtly transformed") but no visible price or foreclosed option appears on the page; her spirit is "light" and certain, suggesting costless success rather than earned renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is signaled early and deepens through the diary's revelations. One meaningful tightening occurs as the elevator climbs and new entries unfold, though the pressure is meditative rather than agonistic; no live antagonist or hard reversal tests Kael's commitment. The resolution is earned by his altered perception ("eyes trained to find the scattered light"), which forecloses his former stance with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and density increase are sufficient, but the stakes never force a choice between competing goods; Kael's journey is observational more than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (prove empty spaces remember) is signaled early and pursued through each cloud entry. The accumulative lens allows pressure to build via density and pattern rather than reversals. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fallstreak hole shifts the catalogue from classification to proof, forecloses doubt, and triggers the emotional release. Cost is felt (two years of grief breaking), though the gondola drift itself imposes no material constraint or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving her life's work—is signaled early and clear. The demolition timer provides external pressure, but the story's true escalation is internal: the coin's fractal pattern reweights her understanding of limits, narrowing her options from desperate preservation to philosophical acceptance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tactile discovery alters her stance. Weakness: the external and internal conflicts run parallel rather than interweaving; the demolition crew's arrival feels like a convenient curtain rather than a force that compounds her choice. Agency is present in the final walk away, but the cost (abandoning murals) is more told than shown in embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—restore the ship's aether-lamp—is signaled early and drives the sequence. Escalation is present (shadows → glyphs → sequence → compartment) but each step succeeds without friction or cost; no live option is foreclosed, no tradeoff made. The starlings and phrasebook arrive as clues rather than obstacles, so pressure never tightens into a choice with visible price. Agency is observation and execution, not decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—learning the repair rhythm before the mentor's hands fail—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elara kneels, finds the prophecy, navigates the hall, and uncaps the lens; the wear-pattern revelation narrows her approach from replacement to "reharmonizing." However, the climax (gear installation) unfolds without resistance, cost, or visible trade-off; the deep hum arrives immediately, no tool breaks, no alternative is sacrificed. One tightening deepening (light revealing wear) meets the length requirement, but the final act lacks a felt price on the page, limiting escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (save the orchard from blight) is signaled early. The reexamination of the bell narrows options and the mirror-aiming sequence tightens pressure, constituting one meaningful escalation. However, the nebula's alignment at midnight introduces a new solution rather than forcing a trade-off among live options. No visible cost (stamina, tool failure, interpersonal friction) complicates the execution. The resolution feels gifted by cosmic timing rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preserve the lullaby across time's end) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the mechanism's activation and the beacon's silent flare, but no live opposition or reversal tests Elara's commitment; the sequence is a ritual execution, not a contested escalation. The clock's "final tick" announces inevitability rather than narrowing options through protagonist choice. Cost—exhaustion, peace, solitude redeemed—is present in the ending but felt rather than a visible forfeiture of an alternative path, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting Q4's reach into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (save travelers before frost activates curse) is signaled early and tightens via the search across three days and the spotted nut "as twilight bled into violet." One meaningful escalation: assembly completion and whistle-blow that triggers the birds and forms the glowing path. The family's arrival and successful escape constitute on-page resolution with visible cost (Elara's shoulders relax only then, she must repeat tomorrow). Agency is present in the assembly and activation, but coincidence supplies both the nut's discovery and the family's convenient arrival at the exact moment the trail forms, diluting protagonist-driven pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translating separation into connection, atoning for dismissing Elara—is signaled in the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when Aris traces the foam bubbles diverging and reuniting, which crystallizes his insight. However, the turn is observational and reflective rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; he watches the water rather than making a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The cost (public acknowledgment, drafting a new proposal) is declared in his resolution but not tested or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled early but remains abstract and philosophical. The piece moves through meditation to action (selecting the slate, quantifying absence, incising the glyph) but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options or raises cost. The moonlight eruption and customer arrival feel like external validation rather than consequences of a trade-off. No live alternative is foreclosed; Elara's quest culminates in success without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—processing the king's stored remorse—is signaled early and culminates in the subsuming sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aris digs into sand, meets ice, and the emotion floods him. However, the resolution unfolds through narrated internal technique ("adding imagined warmth of forgiveness") rather than a visible choice that forecloses an option or tests commitment. Pressure is coherent but lacks a pivot where agency alters tactics or cost becomes undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring community connection—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elara diagnoses the problem immediately, encounters no setbacks, and her multilingual singing works without resistance or adaptation. The "weight wedged in gears" obstacle is resolved in a single smooth action with no visible cost or trade-off. The lack of agency-driven tightening or a choice that forecloses options keeps this in the mid-band despite clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring abandoned dreams—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; memories arrive passively and Elara accepts them without trade-off. The piece lacks a decision point where options narrow or a price is paid; the final act (gathering shards, planning return) reiterates her initial intent without escalation. Agency is absent: Elara observes rather than acts to foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    One dominant stake (retrieve vault combinations) is signaled early and Elara's prior failure teaches her precision, establishing some escalation. The inversion window creates urgency and the threshold crossing is a visible turn that narrows her path to sixty minutes. Yet the grotto sequence unfolds without meaningful opposition or trade-off: she follows the glowing trail, reads the combinations, and exits cleanly. No choice forces her to renounce an alternate path or pay a visible price; the combinations are a gift rather than a prize wrested from competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and remains consistent. The strumming sequence provides a series of beats (low hum, higher memory, final peace) that accumulate texture, and the siskin's trill marks a tightening: the world begins to answer. However, no live opposition or cost appears; Elara succeeds on her first attempt without failure, adjustment, or sacrifice. The "ache in her chest" and tears suggest emotional weight, but no option is foreclosed, no tactic revised, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through a protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking clarity on the broken covenant—is signaled early. The "sharp spike" translated as the prince's demand provides a single tightening moment, and the "profound stillness" reframes his refusal. However, these are interior correlations rather than escalating external pressures that narrow options. The protagonist's agency is introspective throughout; no on-page reversal or trade-off forecloses a live path with felt cost. The resolution ("no longer defined by exile") is a reframing, not a decision that alters tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake ("recover the silence") is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or failure. Elara's method works on the first attempt without cost,误差, or adaptation. The fireworks countdown creates apparent urgency in framing but does not alter her actions—she ignores the detonations, rendering the timeframe ornamental. No on-page reversal narrows options; the ritual proceeds linearly from setup to success. Agency requires a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost; here completion is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens through the seed's arrival, planting, and germination. The anticipation of the corpse flower's stench creates credible tension that tests both her sensitive nose and her spiritual practice. Agency is clear: she chooses deliberate ritual over rushed mastery, and the final shift from conquest to harmonization forecloses the ambition-driven path with visible cost (tears of understanding, not triumph). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (save the western groves from blight) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the arrow tip's vibration, converging water streams, and the gathering of echoes, tightening toward the Cradle Arch. The twig-dipping beat demonstrates the source's power and narrows Kael's options: he cannot harvest, only protect. However, no external obstacle or internal want-versus-fear friction complicates the journey; Kael navigates smoothly and the "source" yields its lesson without resistance. The resolution—shift from harvesting to listening—lands with conceptual cost (no trophy, acceptance of stewardship role) but lacks a visible tradeoff or loss that alters his tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: identify the convergence point to prevent future collapses. Pressure escalates through real-time data complications (unexpected vortices, oscillation realization) and deepens when Croft's patch personalizes the cost. Agency is visible in Kael's adaptive hypothesis shifts and final recommendations with "firm" resolve. The ending forecloses passive acceptance—he commits to mandatory CFD assessments and monitoring. Cost is implied in the "silent dialogue across professions" and carrying "weight of convergence lightly," though the tradeoff remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—certifying wonder as essential—is abstract and never tested by a counterpressure that would force Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. Each bell strike succeeds without complication; no reversal narrows options or changes knowledge. The "forty days across the tundra" and cosmic synchronicity are summary declarations rather than on-page costs. Agency is absent; the ritual unfolds as a predetermined sequence without protagonist decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—harvesting insight from failure—is signaled early and drives the ritual sequence. Pressure accumulates through the flute's sustained note and the vision of past error, but the escalation is textural rather than causal; no live option is narrowed or foreclosed with visible cost. The insight crystallizes, but Kael's path forward is expanded, not constrained, at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is clear early, but escalation is vague: the collision of grief and joy triggers "panic" and "disorientation," yet the text does not dramatize a narrowing of options or a trade-off. The tightening moment ("Clutching the halo fragment, she sought anchor in constants: press pressure, ink ratios") is gestural; the resolution ("the mathematics was not a cage… It was the dynamic interplay itself") is insight-by-epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; Elara moves from turbulence to "lucid peace" without on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the text lacks the visceral reweighting or foreclosure that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—rekindling wonder and purpose—is signaled early and remains coherent. The pendant's activation at the ridgeway overlook provides one meaningful deepening (memory becomes tangible, seed germinates), but this tightening is enacted by the artifact rather than protagonist agency; Kael kneels and watches. No live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the resolution grants him calm and clarity without trade-off. Escalation reads as accumulation (memory → resonance → plant growth → renewed purpose) rather than narrowing pressure, and the final image reweights meaning but without a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: proving objects absorb emotions. Pressure tightens when the breeze reveals the spiral and Mrs. Gable's memory contradicts Kael's reading, forcing a conceptual trade-off (volume vs. authenticity). Yet the escalation is intellectual—a corrected interpretation—rather than a choice between competing goods with on-page forfeit. No live antagonist or resource constraint tests commitment. The resolution is acceptance ("his firmly grounded nature accepting") without visible cost beyond relinquishing a cherished theory, which feels more like expansion than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—sending a message across fifty years—is signaled early and remains coherent. The raveling silence provides a ticking pressure (color bleeding, hollow hush), but escalation operates as accumulation rather than reversal or tightening choice. Elara's agency is present in her decision to weave and to sacrifice her present reality, but that choice is not tested by a complication or forced trade-off; she clears the loom, spins new fibers, and weaves without a beat where an obstacle forces her to alter tactics or pay a visible intermediate cost. The closure cost (translucence, orchard fade) is legible and scaled to this length, but the path to it lacks a meaningful pressure point where options narrow or knowledge changes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restore the orchard and arches to heal the community—is signaled early and remains coherent. The descent and ritual tighten pressure once, but the escalation is textural (deepening atmosphere) rather than a reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The cost (bartered memory) is established before the story begins rather than tested on the page during the peak ritual beat. Kael's agency at closure is decisive action (silk ignition, roots surge, arches restore), but no live option is foreclosed in the moment; the path unfolds smoothly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering Kael's truth—is signaled early and sustained. The weave's volatility ("threatening to eject her into oblivion") offers a tightening moment, and Elara's shift from "accusation to compassion" narrows her approach. However, the escalation is more textural (accumulating visions) than a sequence of foreclosed options or visible costs. The resolution hinges on a perceptual adjustment ("redirecting her intent") without a dramatized trade-off or sacrifice that charges the final image under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the lighthouse legacy through the anonymous letter chain—is signaled early and drives the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias dismantles the old stack and builds the Phoenix Stack, narrowing options from passive grief to active guardianship. The piece operates under Accumulative pressure rather than causal reversals; the cost is legible in the physical ritual and emotional ache. However, the tightening is gentle and lacks a visceral trade-off or loss that would elevate escalation into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—shaping dawn using ancient shadows—is signaled early and the storm provides escalation: the laugh accidentally summons chaos, forcing Kael to steer it. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens as the shadow-glyphs knit calm into fury, and the resolution lands when the storm "integrates" rather than vanishes. However, the escalation feels ceremonial rather than contested; no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off narrows his path, and the cost (solitude, lack of recognition) is told rather than dramatized in a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding why Kaela magnetized stories. The piece signals this early and sustains it, but the escalation is textural (accumulation of light, memory fragments, the blue flash) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The climactic illumination (line 158–168) provides a reversal of understanding, yet the resolution—"to become a surface worthy of reflection"—feels more like an intellectual reframe than a decision with visible cost. Agency is contemplative (watching, waiting, wrapping) rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—accessing tree wisdom via the sextant—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate through Elara's agency or meaningful tightening. The three seasons of dream-mapping occur off-page; on-page action is static waiting until coincidence (pin, moonlight) triggers the sextant's healing. No reversal or deepening changes Elara's options or knowledge in a way that costs her something visible. The moonlight activation itself is a gift of circumstance, not a choice under pressure. The resolution—trees as "compassionate archivists"—arrives without Elara paying a dramatized price or making a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm before endless night consumes light—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as Elara recalls fragments (Cradle Song, Weaver's Chant), the Heartseed pulses, and dawn threads pierce the void. The tightening is clear: each song fragment braids luminous threads, the mica window glows, and communities respond. However, no live option is foreclosed; the ritual succeeds without visible trade-off or tactical constraint. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to confront her mistake and reclaim belonging—is signaled early and pursued through the ritual. However, escalation unfolds primarily through internal realization rather than external pressure narrowing options; the gathering members' acceptance is revealed to her passively, not tested. The ritual itself introduces a meaningful tightening (she must project awareness rather than physically attend), but the cost of remaining apart feels muted because the text tells us she has already been forgiven. One credible on-page choice (smoothing the invitation, lighting the candle, choosing not to descend) with visible but understated consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: finding sacred absolution in ordinary acts of care. One meaningful deepening occurs when Madame Lin presents the bread, transforming memory into present communion and narrowing Elara's path from passive grief to active resilience. However, the escalation feels more like a cumulative layering than a tightening with trade-offs—no live option is foreclosed on-page, and the cost remains largely internal and anticipated (future seasons) rather than immediate. The piece coheres under Accumulative logic but lacks sharp on-page pressure that forces a sacrificial choice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—salvaging the vow's essence before it vanishes—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the illusion flickers violently and then dies, forcing Elara to honor the transition. However, escalation is minimal: no reversal, no choice that narrows options, no visible trade-off. She completes her task as planned, then begins the next; the pressure is atmospheric rather than causal. Under the Accumulative lens, the single deepening (honoring loss as transition) just meets the length's requirement but does not drive agency with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve the truce until dawn while capturing the fracture sound. The three false starts escalate tension through Elara's agency, each narrowing Silas's options with visible tactics. The climax tightening is strong—Silas's patience snaps because prior options are exhausted. Cost is legible: Elara risks exposure and invests hours of tactical effort. The resolution hinges on her forensic evidence and authority, though the ink-forgery reveal arrives conveniently late in her awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding weather-carriers—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification (taste shifts from lavender to rosemary to ozone to honey) and spatial approach (bluff to standing stones), delivering one meaningful tightening as Elara enters the circle and the elements converge. The forest's election choosing compassion and the aurora's surge provide a textural deepening rather than a causal reversal, appropriate to the accumulative lens. Agency reads more as receptive witnessing than decision under fire; Elara's choice to "push past skepticism" and wear the ring happens early, and thereafter she follows rather than shapes the convergence, limiting the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity to honor Lily—is signaled early and drives the portrait action, yet escalation unfolds as puzzle-solving (retrieve charcoal, sketch, align lock, open compartment) rather than a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The broken lock and hidden note provide external solutions rather than internal tightening; Elara does not renounce an easier path, endure against resistance, or pay a price to complete the sketch—her mnemonic gift and the cooperative cave mechanics smooth the way. The final surge ("creativity… now flowed like light through crystal") asserts release without on-page friction or foreclosed alternative in the closure beat, and no moment dramatizes the cost of having suppressed her art (stamina drain, relational sacrifice, tool scarcity) that would charge the ending with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early. The story offers one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes candor in small moments rather than a physical vault, yet this realization arrives more as epiphany than as a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost. The child's and elder's confessions accumulate pressure texturally but do not force Elara to renounce a prior tactic or pay a legible price; she simply receives truth and her hands "still" without dramatized internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's chromatic signature—is signaled early. The sculpture reaches crescendo, but no reversal or tightening narrows options; the process unfolds as designed. Elara's gentle push and the fragment's surrender read as inevitable ritual rather than a test of commitment. Cost is declared ("purpose fulfilled") but not dramatized through a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static—is signaled early and drives one meaningful tightening: Unit Seven chooses the controlled burn, executes it, and the static harmonizes. The ritual narrows options (destroy vs. keep fears) and the cost is conceptual—Lena's artifacts are gone, memories whole but sorrow woven in. One weakness: no live opposition or escalating risk; the ritual proceeds without friction, each object vanishing cleanly. The magnetic-north complication drops away, leaving a static-free arc that deepens theme but lacks reversals or felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—proving listening heals community—is signaled early and frames the accumulative pressure. The noon deadline introduces external urgency, but Elara faces no meaningful trade-off or complication; each story fragment arrives without friction or cost to her. The climax resolves through the city official's unexplained conversion rather than protagonist agency under duress. The "sandstorm calm" voice flattens tension beats that should test her patience or commitment, leaving escalation abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—decrypt journal to send signal and escape isolation—is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs: frustration → dice roll → dance → clarity → valve turn at third chime. Agency is present (she dances to solve, then acts), and the buoy release forecloses waiting passively. Cost is visible (she remains below, rescue now "inevitable" but not yet arrived). However, escalation is gentle; the puzzle yields after one cycle without a failed attempt or deepening price that narrows options before success.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering where deleted memories go and reclaiming Lyra's farewell—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through Elara's journey (coffee-ground divination, climbing the cliffs, navigating gravity fluctuations) and tightens when she reaches the geode and must "pour her longing into the salt." The resolution is a meaningful deepening (the memory restored, the chamber's gravity stilled) with emotional cost (tears, decades of absence). However, the final turn is more world-response than protagonist agency; the salt softens "beneath her touch" and the gravity stills "instantly" without a visible trade-off or difficult renunciation on Elara's part.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never escalates through reversal or meaningful opposition. Elara maps silence, locates the fracture, exhales the hush, and succeeds in a linear sequence without a tightening that narrows options. No on-page cost or trade-off is legible; the prophecy dissolves "like salt in water" without resistance. Agency is performed (she acts) but the act does not foreclose a path or force a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled early and tightens when Mrs. Davison reframes the cornerstone date as compassionate fiction. This reversal narrows Elara's prior extractive method and forces her to adopt a listening stance. The cost is conceptual and relational: she must abandon her archival confidence. However, escalation is primarily contemplative; no physical or external obstacle tests her new understanding on the page, and the resolution arrives through revelation rather than a decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming quarantined grief into independence—is signaled early and held. The ritual proceeds without complication: Elara waits, hums, guides energy, and succeeds. No on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options; the memory surges, she focuses intent, and the crystal archives it cleanly. Cost is asserted ("isolation dissolved," shell buried) but no live path is foreclosed—she gains the outcome without visible trade-off or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Kael's need to forgive himself and lay down thirty years of guilt—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers no reversal or tightening; the ritual proceeds without resistance, and each step (thorn press, key turn, dripping cease) deepens the symbolic release rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. Agency is ceremonial rather than decisional; Kael enacts the ritual's steps, but no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a live alternative. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's participation but lacks visible cost or a moment where the price is felt on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as pattern layering rather than pressure increase.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—learning why some echoes persist—is signaled early and clear. The shell's three disclosures provide a tightening structure, narrowing from general dissonance to Kael's specific shame. Yet escalation is informational rather than agential: Elara receives revelations without facing on-page obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The resolution (singing) does not foreclose a prior path with visible cost; no live option is sacrificed, no tactic visibly altered by resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—salvaging pure truth from wreckage to heal Eleanor—is signaled early and sustained. Yet pressure never tightens: Elara's dream-dive yields immediate success, no complication arises, and the letter-writing proceeds without obstacle or tradeoff. The piece offers a single deepening (the cameo blooming vivid) but no reversal, tactical shift, or live cost that forecloses an option. Agency is present in the decision to write, but the lack of friction or price keeps escalation minimal under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—philosophical appreciation of hidden effort—is signaled early and sustained, but it never tightens or deepens through opposition. The firefly reorganization after the whistle reads as confirmation rather than complication; no reversal or cost narrows options. The protagonist's journey is observational accumulation without a choice that forecloses a path. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is present (fireflies swirling into helix), but no visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—excavate truth vs. preserve sanctuary—is signaled early and escalates through discovery. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes debunking would destroy the stillpoint; her agency (reburial) forecloses her debunker path with visible cost. The moral calculus between truth and protection is sharp. One meaningful deepening drives the closure under the causal lens, and the price (carrying the secret alone, abandoning her mission) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—unlocking ancient knowledge to counter Kael's rigid doctrine—is signaled early and tightens through the ionosphere miracle, which narrows options to a single clear transmission. The vault discovery is a meaningful on-page reversal driven by Elara's agency (the broadcast) with visible cost: her exhaustion and tears, the erosion of Kael's doctrine, and the children's awe. Hemlock's variant allegiance and Lena's secret recording provide secondary pressure that complicates but does not resolve. The escalation reads coherently under the Accumulative lens: density increases, then the pattern breaks when clarity arrives, reweighting the stake with undeniable cost in the collaborative unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (healing the wound with Elara through captured sound) is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate or tighten options. The poet encounters no resistance: the music box yields its melody, the jar capture succeeds, and the ritual completes without complication or cost. The story moves through a series of additive beats (clean, wind, capture, seal, label, place) without a reversal, deepening choice, or trade-off that narrows tactics. The ending summarizes future intentions rather than dramatizing a present sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (protect the Chime) is signaled early and drives the repair sequence. The harmonic stabilizer failure provides a clear complication, and Elara's iterative tuning (strike, file, strike) demonstrates agency and problem-solving. However, the escalation is shallow: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized—she simply executes the forgotten method without setback, resistance, or visible price beyond effort. The ending lands with the Chime restored and marina serene, but the cost is conceptual (duty fulfilled) rather than a felt forfeiture that alters her or the world.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—activating the sigil to begin the patient revolution—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric intensification (moon rising, viaduct glowing, light coalescing) rather than through reversals or choices that narrow options. The escalation is textural and environmental; Elara's agency at the climax (pressing her palm) feels more like completion of a predetermined ritual than a decision with visible tradeoff. The emergence of moss provides on-page consequence but the cost to Elara personally (beyond dissolved impatience) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving Thomas's death was not accidental and exposing the society—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara finds the lantern and physical evidence. The society's "controlling influence" and Elara's entanglement provide internal conflict, but the escalation is investigative rather than forcing a difficult trade-off. The resolution is declared ("she would present," "the controlling influence would shatter") without an on-page choice or visible price; the cost is implied rather than felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake—repairing the box to honor Samuel—is signaled early and tightens when the first opinion declares it "scrap" (91). The turn at line 191 narrows options (repair becomes possible), but it arrives via coincidence (the light shaft) rather than Elias's decision. Agency is limited; Elias observes while Horvath acts. The final resolve to "turn apology into action" offers a trade-off, but it is told rather than tested on the page with a dramatized choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—ringing the silent bell—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: the kaleidoscope's unbroken circle prompts Elara to feed that perfection into the Algorithm, producing the gold-light chime. Yet this turn feels more like ritual completion than a forced trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The "months bled into a tapestry of oil-stained triumphs and spectacular failures" is told rather than dramatized, eliding the reversals that would demonstrate agency under pressure. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights cost; here the texture accumulates smoothly without friction, leaving the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (discover where deleted files go / solve the cold case) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vance orders compliance and Elara chooses defiance, narrowing her path and forcing the lie. The cost is legible on the page: she falsifies records, encrypts evidence, and accepts isolation as guardian. However, the escalation lacks a second pressure point—once she inputs the code, discovery flows without resistance; no lock, no failed attempt, no trade-off between options. The resolution traces to Elara's agency, but the final third coasts on revelation rather than further complication.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the orchard from encroaching ice—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The sequence through three mirrors provides a structural tightening (memory, fear, hope converging), but this escalation operates as thematic layering rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The peacekeeper faces no meaningful resistance; each glimpse surfaces on cue, and the reconstitution succeeds without cost, complication, or adaptation. The ice's threatening grind ceases and "the world suspended" creates atmospheric tension, yet the protagonist's agency remains passive observation rather than decision under duress. The resolution arrives through assertion ("channeled the emotional resonance") rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to proceed with euthanasia appointment, signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: the net surfaces with Lars's father's journal, reframing the "sound of approaching endings" from void to resonance. Elara's agency crystallizes in the decision to keep the appointment "with clarity" yet sit with the community tonight—a stance that forecloses neither path fully, which under Accumulative lens qualifies as Charged Poise but lacks a dramatized trade-off scene. Cost is present (she delays, she listens) but the escalation from volunteer work to community belonging feels more textural deepening than pressure-driven turn. No antagonist required; coincidence (finding the journal) complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling Clara and Liam—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is thin: Elara's method (showing the letter, drawing the vine parallel, confessing purpose) proceeds without resistance or complication. The couple's shift from rigidity to understanding happens in a single beat without a visible tightening or cost that narrows options. The ending declares reconciliation underway but does not dramatize a trade-off or price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve the echo before it fades—is signaled early and remains consistent. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalatory: the echo dims like embers, but no active complication or trade-off appears. Kael's method (peripheral awareness, weight shifts, consecration) unfolds without friction or failure; he succeeds on the first attempt with no visible cost beyond aching joints and a tear. The ritual's success feels predetermined rather than earned through agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into shared understanding—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, the escalation is iterative rather than tightening: each Tuesday session repeats the same method (show photo, draw arc, watch response) without a reversal or complication that narrows options. Liam's arrival provides one emotional deepening, but no on-page antagonist or friction tests Elara's resolve. The resolution (community gallery, harvest moon gathering) is earned by repetition and time rather than a protagonist choice with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is expected; the story offers steady accumulation but no sharp pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the library's pattern of growth—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the suspended hush "felt deeper" and the crystal warms, narrowing focus to the elemental sounds. Agency is present (choosing to restore the crystal) but the cost of leaving feels muted; his "profound peace" undercuts the sense of foregoing something live. Escalation is more textural deepening than contested pressure, fitting the accumulative lens but limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capture the sound of growing older—is signaled early and sustained. Elara's ritual (placing four markers) tightens focus incrementally, and the fog's coalescence into the rocking chair deepens the stake when the sound arrives. Yet no live option is foreclosed: she experiences the sound, it fades, and she vows to repeat the cycle. The "tidal longing…settled deep within her bones as quiet purpose" reconfigures mood but not tactics or cost. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, but the visible price remains unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: capture the 1.7-second Lunar Veil before the Chronometer's chaos loses it. The earthquake establishes urgency, the spinning hand tightens options, and the leaf-observation deepens Elara's understanding. The final recalibration forecloses the path of "forceful correction" with a felt cost: she must yield control, trust stillness. However, the escalation curve is smooth rather than wrenching—no failed first attempt or visible trade-off dramatizes the risk of her gentle approach. The coincidence of the leaf falling at the exact moment she needs insight borders on resolving rather than complicating, slightly undercutting earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elara seeks a "flawless goodbye" that honors truth, not denial. Pressure deepens through the song's accumulation (coffee steam, off-key hum, broken record as music), and the lavender scent arrives as a complication that validates memory. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options—Elara's plan unfolds as scripted, and the family's reconciliation is received rather than earned through a trade-off or renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightens when the orrery shudders at zenith, forcing Elara to apply the relearned rune under pressure. The cost is visible: three seasons of study, the need to relearn foundational symbols, and the final corrective act that closes the loop. Agency is clear throughout; Elara's decisions (key insertion, rune correction) drive the resolution. Minor issue: the resistance beat ("gears grinding") resolves quickly without sustained escalation or a secondary complication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—proving Lyra's true condition—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate on the page. The tooth's cleft is examined and immediately confirms Elara's hypothesis without complication or reversal. The resolution (planting a "constellation" garden, gathering elders) is planned rather than enacted, so agency remains prospective. No live tightening or trade-off forecloses an option with visible cost; the story summarizes future intentions instead of dramatizing a peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (craft a cool light for Liam) is signaled early and clear. No reversal or complication disrupts the polishing; the sea glass "surrenders" its veil without resistance. Elara's process is meditative and uncontested—no material shortage, no fumbled attempt, no moment where she must choose between speed and quality. The ending gesture (wrapping, descending, delivering) is intention without on-page test. Cost is declared ("immense weight of compassion") but never forecloses a live option or forces a trade.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: healing from public exposure of regret. One meaningful tightening occurs when the icicle pattern leads to the moss circle, prompting the pendant's release. Agency is renunciation, but the choice lacks a visible trade-off—no live alternative is foreclosed, and the viral storm remains external backdrop. Pressure is more atmospheric than escalating; the ritual deepens her stance but doesn't force a costly decision between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—complete the novel with integrity versus publishers' nihilism—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The cameo-collection beats accumulate without escalation or trade-off: each vision appears, he "solemnizes" it, and moves to the next with no cost, failed attempt, or narrowing of options. The ending declares success ("ready to be shared") without a reversal or choice that forecloses a path. Under the inferred Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient, but the piece does not deliver a deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stakes; it simply stops gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the forgotten songs—is signaled early and pursued continuously. However, escalation is absent: Elara sings the songs in sequence without complication, reversal, or visible price. The "method demanded precision" and the alignment condition could have forced tactical adjustments or a near-miss, but every verse succeeds on first attempt with no friction. Coincidence (the perfect alignment arriving exactly when she finishes) resolves the conflict without protagonist agency narrowing options or accepting a trade-off. Under the Causal lens, this reads as and-then sequencing with no meaningful tightening or deepening that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (safekeep starlight, forge renewal map), and the ritual provides one meaningful beat sequence. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is shallow: each step proceeds without resistance, complication, or visible trade-off. The blood-drop and starlight convergence arrive as solutions rather than hard-won achievements. No live option is foreclosed, no competing desire pressures the protagonist, and the successful transformation lacks a felt cost that would elevate the final image. The piece delivers a single tightening moment (the starlight touches the paper) but no deepening that changes options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—repair the timer to harvest echoes—is signaled early and drives each observational beat. However, escalation is weak: each time-of-day observation smoothly reveals the next clue without genuine reversal, risk, or tradeoff. The misalignment discovery (line 182) is presented as insight rather than a turn that forecloses options. No visible price is paid; Kael's success feels procedural. The accumulative lens permits steady intensification, but the final beat lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: transform the merchant's anxiety into tangible weight. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anxiety resists and Elara adjusts the central thread, triggering calcification. Agency is present (the shuttle adjustment), but the resistance feels atmospheric rather than a live obstacle that forces a trade-off. The obsidian sculpture is the result, yet the cost—what Elara forfeits or endures to achieve it—is told in reflection ("her own solitude") rather than dramatized through a visible price paid in the weaving scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into a vessel—is signaled early and the kettle's boil provides a time boundary. However, the carving proceeds without complication: each gouge "harvests" a lesson without friction, error, or competing impulse. The whistle interrupts focus but does not force a trade-off; Elara simply shifts to tea. The final paragraph reweights "loss" as "harvest," but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price alters her tactics. Pressure is coherent but does not meaningfully tighten under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with her younger self—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the collection of fragments, each click of the wheel deepening her understanding of erosion and compromise. The tightening occurs when her own past voice surfaces ("It will be magic made manifest"), forcing her to confront the gap between ambition and execution. The cost is visible: she must forgive herself and integrate the ghost, foreclosing the path of self-blame. Agency is clear in her choice to offer the wheel and share the sculptor's story.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting purpose from abandonment through intelligent design—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Elara discovers the sextant, measures angles, clears debris, and the water finally flows, narrowing options from abstract puzzle to concrete action. The "soft gurgle" micro-turn and the light refraction provide one meaningful escalation under the Causal lens. However, the opposition is environmental rather than interpersonal or internal conflict with contradictory wants, and the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("equations for hope") rather than viscerally felt. The cost (labor, time, solitary resolve) is present but not foregrounded as a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (make peace with the abandoned dream) is signaled in paragraph five and tested at the climax when she presses the fork to the crystal. The resonance moment tightens options—she can no longer deny the continuity between her music and her clockwork. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no external opposition or second character complicates the choice, and the cost (leaving the fork) feels more symbolic than materially consequential within this single visit.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies and salvaging integrity—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elara deciphers the coordinates, collapsing the expedition's false premise and exposing Thorne's theft. However, this turn is delivered entirely in reflection ("collapsed in her mind") without on-page obstacles or a present reversal that narrows options. The resolution (choosing documentation over vengeance) is protagonist-driven but the price remains abstract; no action or forfeiture concretizes what she relinquishes or gains at the closure beat. Agency reads as contemplative stance-taking rather than a decision under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve the storm-oak seed via decoded knowledge. The knot-reading tightens from broad goal to precise landmark (diamond knot → third piling), forecloses guesswork, and the final realization reweights the stake from seed-as-relic to method-as-legacy. Agency is present (Elara decodes, moves to piling, secures glass), and the fisherman's silent approval adds pressure. However, no reversal or complication tests commitment; the sequence unfolds as smooth discovery without trade-off or visible price paid in the moment. The coincidental arrival of the fisherman weakens escalation causality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding Isolde's absence—is signaled early but never tests Elara with a live choice or reversal. The trance sequence unfolds as a passive reception of images; Kael's arrival provides explanation rather than complication. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs because Elara never faces competing options or visible cost. The resolution is handed to her ("You carry the map now") rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ritual's success/failure provides one meaningful tightening when the shell cracks, revealing spectral rather than physical form. However, the escalation is compressed into a single night's culmination without on-page resistance or tactical adjustment; Kaelen's agency is assembly and acceptance rather than decision under conflicting pressure. The cost (fleeting beauty, irreplaceable loss) is felt but arrives as revelation rather than trade-off forged through prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing, harmonizing inherited fire with chosen preservation—is signaled early and coherent. The ritual deepens her resolve but does not tighten options or force a trade-off; she performs the graft unopposed, and the kelp's success is affirmed immediately (gentle breeze, silent affirmation, sunbeam). No reversal or escalation narrows her path. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens where pressure builds through layered imagery, yet the final beat resolves into affirmation without visible cost or foreclosed possibility. Agency is present in the deliberate ritual acts but no renunciation or endurance test occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories before dawn—is signaled early and sustained. The quest accumulates pressure through the breadcrumb trail, each fountain adding a clue that narrows options (must find all pieces). The geese-alignment convergence at the Grand Celestial Basin provides a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present in Elara's choices to search and arrange, though coincidence (geese forming Lyra at the right moment) aids the resolution. Cost is visible in the city's transformation but felt cost to Elara personally is muted; her tears at the end are more cathartic release than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gear clicks into place and sapphire petals cascade, then emerald light stirs dormant gases. However, no on-page reversal or mistake forces Elara to pay a visible price; the "master ping" succeeds without prior misstep or trade-off. The great-grandmother's scar is backstory texture, not a live constraint. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening is present but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: to find a memorial form that honors collective grief. The piece deepens rather than escalates—Elara moves from wrestling with the commission to discovering the circular sandstone path design through memory and metaphor. Agency is internal (retracing, listening, seeing the parallel), and the tightening occurs when Lyra's gesture and the monarchs crystallize the answer. Cost is conceptual (the sacred responsibility, the weight of 37 lives) but not dramatized as a tactical trade-off or visible forfeiture that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the clock to re-anchor communal time—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens in the mechanism room: the grit-seized pivot, the cleaning ritual, the calibrated push. The pendulum's pause functions as a meaningful deepening that reweights the task with ancestral resonance. However, escalation is largely internal and accumulative; no external complication or secondary character tests Elara's commitment, and the reverie itself is mystically granted rather than forced by a tactical dilemma. The resolution—clock strikes, village stirs, old Liam nods—delivers consequence, but the cost is diffuse (communal relief) rather than a personal sacrifice or forfeited path for Elara. One tightening is present and sufficient under the Accumulative lens, but the lack of a visible tradeoff or failed attempt caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (discovering Albright's intention) is clear, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options. Each thread decodes smoothly without resistance; no thread contradicts her hypothesis or forces a reinterpretation. The ending reweights prior confusion into understanding, yet this shift lacks a felt price—no time pressure, no sacrifice, no foreclosed path. Escalation reads as accretion without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (break the frozen stagnation via predictive modeling), but no on-page escalation occurs. Doubt coils, she mentally retraces data layers, certainty settles—no reversal, no tightening that narrows options, no visible price paid. The atmospheric pressure system and fissure mechanics are exposition; we never see a live complication test her model or force a trade-off. Agency is renunciation of fear via internal review, but the reader cannot point to a sentence where cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transcribing forbidden broadcasts to resurrect shared narrative—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through sensory density and the recurring threat of discovery (cloak slip, crackle of interference), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible cost; Elara completes her task without tactical adjustment or forfeiture. The final image deepens meaning (copyist → midwife) yet lacks a felt price paid in this moment. Agency is present as attention and endurance, but the ending reconfigures meaning more than it forecloses a live option with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake ("crystallize the fleeting emotion") is declared early but never tested on the page. Elara faces no reversal, no moment where the ritual might fail or demand a tradeoff; the portrait emerges through intuitive grace without friction. The rocking chair's deceleration is atmospheric rather than a pressure point that narrows her options. Agency is absent: Elara performs a predetermined ritual rather than making a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve knowledge vs. reveal truth) is signaled early and tested once meaningfully when the tablet's implication shatters his narrative framework (line 138). Kael's agency—wrapping and sealing the tablet—forecloses the revelation path with visible cost: bearing the weight of silence and risking annihilation of his archive. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening reads as a deepening that reweights his custodian role. No antagonist is required; Councilor Valerius exists as offstage pressure, and the resolution is Kael's own stance crystallization with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (healing fractured town through choir harmony) is signaled early, and the "subtract noise" method provides a conceptual frame for escalation. However, the weeks-long arc is summarized rather than shown in distinct reversals, so pressure accumulates off-page. The Liam–Anya exchange is a meaningful shift, but it arrives as a micro turn without visible prior cost that narrows Elara's options. Agency is collective rather than protagonist-driven, and Elara's role is facilitative—she holds space but does not make a costly choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—planting a knowledge fruit to transform ruin into renewal—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs: pruning releases memories, which then nourish the seed. Yet the escalation is textural rather than causal: each snip adds a memory flavor without raising resistance or cost. No live opposition appears; the thorns and decay are static obstacles easily cleared. The "deep hum" and emerging shoot feel granted by the alignment rather than won by a trade-off or renunciation that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: reveal the blackout cause while honoring wonder over data. The tightening occurs when Dr. Aris arrives desperate for answers, but Kael's choice to use the riddle versus a direct log entry is pre-decided—no on-page deliberation or friction tests commitment. The riddle's unfolding provides texture, yet the escalation is cognitive (puzzle-solving) rather than a narrowing of Kael's options with visible cost. Earned under the Accumulative lens but lacks a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but remains contemplative rather than urgent. The single on-page action (placing the shard) produces immediate revelation without complication or resistance; "instantly" a hush descends and the answer appears fully formed. No tightening of options occurs because Elara faces no competing desire, external obstacle, or internal friction; her theory is confirmed rather than tested. The comparison to newer houses with "purchased, not carried" objects provides thematic contrast but no causal pressure on Elara's present choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the absence of visible cost or foreclosed path keeps this in mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—renewing the city through nuance—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Kael encounters no opposition, internal contradiction, or price that narrows his options; the revelations unfold as given information rather than hard-won choices. The resolution (garden "breathes anew") is declarative wish-fulfillment with no on-page cost, trade-off, or foreclosed path. Pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of regret through mathematical proof—is signaled early and tightens through decades of etching, culminating in "The Rupture Theorem" at t=0. The rupture itself is a meaningful turn that reweights her relationship to the staircase. However, escalation is told across "decades measured in footsteps" rather than dramatized in scene; the climax ("final limit symbol") arrives without visible obstacles or tactical choices within the text's present action. Cost is legible (she remains on the staircase) but felt rather than materially paid in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and coherent throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the nurse not only pauses but adds a wildflower and note, reweighting Elara's thesis. However, Elara's agency is largely observational: she creates and places the painting, then watches; the nurse's action drives the turn. The cost—tears and the shift from insomnia as void to vigil—is felt but not a forfeiture that narrows future options under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rescuing a dying art before silence claims it—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Elara discovers the silver-leaf carving, which reframes the problem (the art can adapt without honey). However, escalation is minimal: once the herb is identified, the path forward is straightforward with no live opposition or trade-off. The ninety-day absence of the beekeeper provides temporal pressure, but the thaw's arrival is environmental coincidence rather than protagonist-driven timing. The resolution is communal and feels predetermined once the knowledge is corrected, reducing the felt cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving time is not a prison but a puzzle—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tide's nadir creates urgency, and Elara's agency (disengaging the clutch, initiating the sequence) drives the tightening. The reversal (dormant lens ignites with counter-clockwise motion, stone's "weep" becomes "awake") is earned by her prior reverse-engineering work. The cost is visible: she has expanded fate's design but not erased the hunger stone's grim history, accepting a permanent dialogue between warning and wonder. The pressure escalates smoothly under the Causal lens with one clear deepening at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unbosom fear's weakness—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the advisor offers his own emptiness as bait, forcing the fear-thing to recoil and confess. Pressure coheres under the causal lens but the entity's collapse feels too immediate after one exchange; no tactical adaptation or escalating cost shapes the middle. The resolution hinges on dialogue rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (orchard survival against the leeward tide) is signaled early. However, escalation reads as ornamental layering rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. Each dub succeeds without friction; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by emerging cost. The storm's transformation into "soaring, complex chord" arrives as aesthetic description rather than earned reversal with visible price, keeping the score below the 7.0 gate for felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reach and question the Watchers—is signaled in paragraph five and drives all subsequent action. The story delivers one meaningful tightening: celestial alignment confirms theory, forcing Elara to test years of study in a single note. Agency is clear (she chooses to play despite uncertainty), and cost is legible (the ending reconfigures her from mere survivor to living question, carrying communal weight). The engineers' "futile force" versus Elera's patience establishes tactical contrast, though we never see her method fail or force a mid-story trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—rescuing truth—is declared but never tested by opposition, cost, or reversal. Aris's parallel-drawing solves the problem in a single move with no friction, no tightening of options, no visible price paid on the page. The piece asserts "weight of deception lifted" and "unwavering resolve" without dramatizing what he risks or forfeits. Agency is present (he chooses to publish the findings) but the choice faces no live obstacle or trade-off, leaving escalation flat under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving abandoned dreams before the lake reclaims the pavilion—is signaled early and sustained. The drawbridge's imminent closure provides a ticking clock, yet no on-page moment shows Elias forced to choose which note to prioritize, abandon a repair, or wrestle with whether his method actually honors the dead or simply soothes himself. The escalation reads as accumulation (more notes placed) rather than tightening; the metallic clang arrives but does not alter his tactics or force a visible trade-off, leaving the pressure more atmospheric than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: verify the Charter's authenticity and recover the Deep-Singer truth. One tightening occurs when marginalia ink and fiber weave reveal dissonance, forcing Elara to "readjust her entire approach" and use the stamp's blank end instead of the carved face. This reversal narrows her method but doesn't foreclose a competing want or impose visible cost—she achieves her goal without trading anything away. The resolution is protagonist-driven but reads as procedural success rather than a choice under competing pressures. No live alternative (e.g., preserving institutional authority vs. truth) is dramatized and rejected on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief into bearable form—is signaled early and sustained through polishing, recording, and folding. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: each ritual step deepens the process until the final crane placement and decision to continue. The choice to fold again forecloses retreat with visible emotional cost (the acknowledgment tear, the acceptance that torment persists). However, the escalation path is smooth rather than sharply tightened; no reversal or mid-story complication tests commitment. Agency is present in the decision to persist, but a single meaningful deepening without a turn or forced trade-off caps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: discovering where unused potential pools. The perturbation experiment tightens pressure (bone-deep shift, vision of the pool), and the circuit-breaker deadline forces a reversal that dissolves the vision but leaves knowledge intact. Agency is present in Elara's mental nudge and her decision to pocket the geode and descend, though the peak moment is realization rather than a choice between competing goods. Cost is visible in tears, trembling, and the "bleak exhilaration," and the final stance forecloses dwelling in the past. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (vision → knowledge etched into soul) suffices, though a sharper trade-off would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (recover the chip to awaken the orrery and decode belonging) is signaled early and pressure tightens from search → discovery → insertion → activation. However, the escalation is delivered by the technology and setting rather than Kael's agency under duress—he follows instructions, encounters no reversal, and the orrery simply works. The ending reconfigures meaning (connection vs. location) but the protagonist does not pay a visible price or foreclose a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—relieving guilt by confronting withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens when the watch hand surfaces. The discovery tightens options by crystallizing his responsibility, and the vow forecloses evasion with felt regret. However, the escalation is internal and retrospective; no external opposition tests the choice on the page, and the cost ("heavier, holier weight") is declared rather than paid in action. Agency is present in the vow but deferred to dawn, leaving the closure moment poised rather than decisively changed.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—moving from apology to tangible absolution through prisoner exchange—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the moon emerges and the protocol executes (daggers flash, ropes fall). Agency is present in Elias's and Kaela's synchronized nod and the deliberate untethering. The resolution (prisoners freed, thread of trust woven) is earned by prior setup and carries visible cost (Elias's internal chains loosen but memory remains). Under Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling his broken trust in navigation—is clear from line one. Pressure tightens meaningfully at Widow's Point when poles vanish, collapsing his penance method and forcing him upward to the stars. The turn is protagonist-driven (he chooses to look up, wipe the compass, secure it) with visible cost: abandoning shame-based avoidance and accepting humility. One reversal is sufficient for this length. The closure choice narrows his path from evasion to integration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—kindle empathy where none remains—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the labyrinth's challenges (misplaced period, ink smudge, shadow-arrow, moss-spelled crawl space) that demand intuition the procedure tried to erase, forcing Kael to rebuild discernment. At the lake, he stops fighting memories and "held these truths not with defensiveness, but with aching, compassionate understanding," which constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost: the baseball placement triggers the light surge without evident sacrifice, and the empathy integration arrives as gift rather than hard-won choice. The labyrinth's forks are described as "demanding intuition," yet each solution (shadow-arrow, moss spelling) reads as puzzle-key matching rather than agonized decision that narrows options or raises personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and held: reforge bond with Kael beyond death. The ritual's progression accumulates pressure (spice-scent thickens, metamorphosis begins, form coalesces), but escalation reads as smooth, predetermined unfolding rather than a turn that narrows options or forces trade-off. The metamorphosis is described as "reluctant" yet proceeds without on-page complication, reversal, or moment where Elara must weigh competing goods (e.g., keeping her whisper gift versus bridge-building). Cost is visible at closure (surrender of mortal shape, voice becomes the orchard), yet because no live alternative or obstacle materializes mid-scene, the tightening required for higher bands does not land; the story accumulates toward a foretold endpoint rather than escalating through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and sustained. Yet escalation is minimal: Elara's vigil proceeds without reversal or on-page tightening. The ritual unfastens the locket, places relics together, and triggers visions, but no decision narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "tear fell onto the saucer's crack" and thumb-press are gestures, not choices with visible cost. Understanding "blooms, gentle and sure" rather than emerging from agency under pressure. Coincidence (the saucer cracking at Lyra's cry) seeds the quest without dramatized consequence, and the resolution—descending with "heart unfastened from fear"—grants relief without forfeiting a live path or enduring credible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (unlock the dimension to restore life's echo) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the shadow-work sequence, but escalation is serial addition rather than narrowing—each photograph grants more levitation without trade-off or complication. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; Elara never faces a cost that alters her tactics. The resolution feels inevitable from the start, with no moment where success is genuinely uncertain or where her pacifist compassion is tested against a competing good.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest to understand transformation—is signaled early but remains abstract and internally declared. The release of the bugs deepens the texture (shift from holding to letting go) but doesn't narrow options or force a visible trade-off; she acts alone without meaningful opposition or cost. The prophecy fulfillment (volcano quieting) is coincidental rather than driven by her agency. One tightening occurs (the decision to uncork), but the escalation lacks a felt price that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—sparking the revolution by signaling the network—is clear from the outset. Pressure tightens when Kael adjusts the gnomon "with infinitesimal care," the panel opens, and the moss-flare is answered by Elara's green pulse, confirming network activation. The tightening is meaningful and the cost (exposure risk, the transformation of silence into shared purpose) is legible. Agency is decision-driven and the resolution earned, though the execution proceeds smoothly without a reversal that tests commitment or forces a visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring friction through sacred patterns—is signaled early and drives Elara's actions. One meaningful turn occurs when the ritual succeeds and eels gather, reweighting her understanding from herding to invitation. However, escalation is thin: the vision of failure is raised then overridden by breath and purpose without meaningful cost or tactical adjustment. The stones scatter on a stray breeze in her vision but not on the page, so the threat remains hypothetical. The cost (dimmed aurora, lighter pouch) is present but told in summary rather than tested in a subsequent decision that forecloses options. No live antagonist or external resistance complicates her attempt, and the success arrives without a difficult trade-off or renunciation that would elevate this into high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding scar cartography—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the letter discovery and the sob as dam-break, a recognizable tightening. Yet escalation lacks visible cost: the tears and subsequent peace arrive without trade-off, Elara's writing resumes "steady for the first time in years" with no dramatized obstacle or forfeiture. The darkroom timer chime marks the moment but does not force a choice. Accumulative lens holds, but the deepening is asserted more than earned through on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—decrypting the hidden overture—is clear and sustained. Escalation reads as puzzle-solving rather than choice under mounting pressure; the seventh, tenth, and final needle alignments are sequential discoveries, not reversals that narrow options. No visible price is paid; Elara's composure remains "unbroken" and the "dignified chaos" yields to "elegant order" without a tradeoff or foreclosed path. The protagonist's agency is observational and methodical rather than decision-driven with felt cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the rebuild through Elara's monthly molt—is signaled early and tightens when she voices fear of abandoning "stone and mortar." Kael's "luminous fracture" reframe narrows her options, forcing acceptance of transformation with on-page emotional cost. The seed-planting functions as Earned Stasis: she surrenders control, forecloses resistance to change, and commits to the community project beyond any single persona. Agency is renunciation of fixity, and the price—loss of Silas's granite resolve—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reaching the arbor to commune with Leo and "surprise fate"—is signaled early, but escalation is linear: Elara decodes the cipher, plays the sequence, ascends, follows compasses, plays the duet, and succeeds without meaningful friction or cost during the attempt. The compasses "flicker violently" but settle "decisively," offering guidance rather than testing her resolve. The clock's one-minute advance at closure provides a tightening conceptual cost, but the middle lacks a reversal or tactical price that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake (protect cultural memory before the monsoon) is signaled early and the timeframe tightens pressure. The tightening is visible: dream interpretation → planting → sensory eruption. However, the eruption itself is not driven by Elara's agency at that beat; the seed awakens passively after she plants it, and the final cost is summarized across multiple forward-looking paragraphs rather than a single on-page choice or trade-off that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and pursued through the compass ritual. The memory sequence offers a deepening (perceiving cerulean regret within the remembered dock scene) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The ritual is initiated by Elias without external opposition, and the resolution grants emotional release without a visible trade-off or path foreclosed on the page, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake. The dominant stake evolves from survival to purposeful meaning-making.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are internal and abstract; escalation occurs through density increase in mapping silence, driven by Elara's agency, but lacks a traditional tightening of options or palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a flawless density increase. The dominant stake (discovering thought's origin) tightens through the protagonist's agency in interacting with the violin, a choice made after thirty-one loops of patient observation. The cost is the endured repetition and the dissolution of the known (the loop, the violin) for a new, serene clarity. The final turn is a deepening that changes knowledge and forecloses the prior state of searching.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase: the examination of the logbook, smudge, and marginalia deepens the internal stake (weight of guilt) until it reconfigures. Protagonist agency drives each step (leaning close, recalling memory). Cost is legible in the tear darkening the smudge and the transformed understanding of "fault-tolerance." One meaningful tightening suffices, foreclosing her prior arrogance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through density of observation and the cadence shift into the refuge. The dominant stake—witnessing transformation—tightens with the river’s new course, and Elara’s agency in traveling and chronicling forecloses other paths with a felt cost of accepting decay. However, the passive nature of observation limits the pressure’s visceral intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift: the arrival of the eclipse deepens the silent, shared attention, reweighting the dominant stake (nurturing wonder) with palpable cost (Liam's vulnerability and awe). Elara's agency is in her adaptive, patient orchestration of music, memory, and the offered object. The stakes—rekindling a child's dimmed curiosity—are intimately felt, and the resolution is earned through her tailored, non-forceful approach.

    Dominant stake (preserving memory) escalates via the ticking clock and Elias's agency in placing notes. Cost is felt in the emotional labor and the lake's reclamation, tightening options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency—hypothesis, examination, discovery, action—under a causal lens. The cost is legible in the permanent stamping that restores a silenced voice, tightening stakes from abstract inquiry to concrete, irreversible testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief) is signaled early and escalates through the accumulative intensity of the recording and folding ritual. Agency is fully hers; the cost is legible in the "single tear" and the continued, weary action of selecting another paper. The tightening is a deepening of the central paradox: to ascend (find peace/purpose), she must first descend (into torment). The final image reweights the stake with undeniable, quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear from the start; escalation is driven by her mental nudge and the ticking clock of the circuit breakers, leading to a cost-laden revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of belonging signaled early; escalation driven by Kael's agency using drone and retrieval; cost unmistakable in emotional shift and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. deception) tightens through the discovery of the watch hand, an escalation driven by Elias's agency. The cost—exchanging silent guilt for the weight of honesty—is unmistakable on the page and reweights options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of redemption escalates through the tense exchange and internal realization; agency is clear, cost legible in Veridian Pass memory, but escalation under Accumulative lens is slightly subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake (regaining self-trust) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: the deliberate pattern of counting poles collapses, creating a crisis that forces Arlo's choice to look up. The cost is unmistakable ("Tears mixed with salt spray, hot and shameful") and the resolution (using the compass with humility) forecloses his path of penance with a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (kindling empathy) escalates through Kael's agency under the causal lens: each decoded clue tightens options, culminating in the lake scene where he must confront past memories. Cost is legible on-page in the "aching, compassionate understanding" and tears. No coincidence resolves; the progression is driven by his choices, with one meaningful deepening that forecloses his emotional numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (reforging bond) escalate through the ritual; protagonist's agency in performing the metamorphosis leads to a cost (loss of former self) that is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through ritual density to a decisive cadence shift—the tear falling on the crack—driven by Elara's agency. Cost is unmistakable in the release of anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake (opening the dimension to restore hope) escalates through Elara’s agency: each memory integration narrows her options and heightens the cost of shadow work. The final trade-off—offering her stitched-together self—carries unmistakable on-page cost in her tears and weightless release.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding transformation) escalates through Elara's agency; the release is a decisive intensification under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable on the page ("giving her only treasure").

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven entirely by Kael's agency under the causal lens: his calculated use of the blackout and the sundial narrows options and raises the stakes of discovery. The dominant stake—sparking the silent revolution—is signaled early and tightens through each step of the ritual. A visible cost is legible in the risk of his covert action, though the immediate consequence is successful, foreclosing his path of passive duty.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (restoring friction) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elara's agency in performing the ritual under the threat of her precognitive vision. A meaningful tightening occurs as she sprinkles star dust and chants, leading to the cost-legible outcome. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through pattern density.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (will she find her voice?) escalates through the letter's discovery and her emotional breakdown. Agency is clear (she opens the letter, chooses to write). Cost is unmistakable in the sob and tears. One meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in decoding, tightening via needle alignments; cost is legible in her shift to vulnerable collaboration, though stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (fear that molt betrays the rebuild) is signaled early and escalates through dialogue with Kael. The tightening is a choice to plant the seed, an act of endurance and renunciation that forecloses the path of fear. Cost is felt in her emotional release and the physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of emotional refuge escalates through her agency in decoding and playing; the cost of confronting grief is legible in the clock's shift and her renewed resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalate with the approaching monsoon; agency is central in her interpreted dream and planting, with cost felt in her doubt and the silence before the eruption, driving the narrative under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (finding the color of apologies) escalates through accumulative density; protagonist agency (tracing lace) drives tightening, with cost legible in the emotional release and smoothed guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—how Aris will relate to loss and meaning in the wake of the flood—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates quietly via the accumulative lens: his repeated returns, the shift from calculations to sketches, and the decision to repair the roof mark tightening commitments. However, the conflict remains internal and relatively low-friction; there is little real resistance beyond his own previous habit, and the cost of change feels gentle. The resolution is earned, but the sense of risk and sacrifice is muted for a piece aiming at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the ledger and how to live in relation to the violence done to her—is clear but mostly internal and philosophical. Tension arises from the attack’s aftermath and the implied ongoing danger around the smuggling operation, yet no immediate external pressure intrudes on the canyon scene to force choices under live threat. The main tightening is her shift from seeing the ledger as burden/evidence to recognizing it as a “scorched testament” she must transform, which narrows her options conceptually but not in a visibly risky, practical way. The result is a meaningful but relatively low-intensity escalation that suits the lyric mode but keeps stakes from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can bridge trauma and silence to connect with another survivor—is clear and sharpened by Liam’s arrival and the violent magenta/charcoal bloom on the glass. Pressure escalates in a single, coherent tightening: Liam’s anguish overwhelms the pane, forcing Elara to actively intervene with her method. However, the resolution comes relatively smoothly, with limited sense of risk that the attempt could fail or backfire, and the “cost” is mostly implied emotional effort rather than a felt trade-off. As a result, tension is solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the drowned civilization’s final words will remain lost or be given true rest—is clear and meaningful. There is a credible tightening when Elias chooses not to log the lens as salvage and when the first shard transforms “the light failed us” into a completed plea, reweighting his task. However, conflict is largely one-sided: there’s little resistance from environment, rules, or inner doubt once his method works, and each subsequent placement is a success montage rather than a test. The result is moving but low-tension, more meditative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving and deepening intergenerational trust under scarcity—is clear from the outset and coherently pursued. Escalation is quiet but present: the repeated runs accumulate, and the key tightening is Lena’s instinctive support of Lin, which prompts Elara’s covenant with the bell. External pressure from sanctions is implied rather than dramatized; we never feel a concrete on-page threat or real risk on a specific run. As a result, the conflict lives almost entirely in the emotional/social register and remains gentle, effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can locate and transmute the stored “unused love” tied to her dockside regret—is clear and coherently pursued. Escalation is handled via accumulative deepening rather than reversals: each cycle of breath reveals more (spark, constellation, carved heart, liquid gold), tightening her engagement with the emotional core. Her agency lies in sustained, disciplined attention and willingness to release, culminating in the conscious act of breathing freedom into the stored love. The conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, with little resistance or real risk of failure, so while the progression is satisfying, the sense of jeopardy or sacrifice is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can free the trapped moment and escape retrocognitive imprisonment—is clearly signaled and resolved. Pressure escalates as she prepares and performs the ritual, with the fragment’s disintegration and memory release serving as the main tightening beat. However, the process unfolds relatively smoothly; there’s little sense of possible failure, competing impulses, or cost beyond anticipated catharsis, which keeps tension at a contemplative rather than gripping level. Her agency is present but not significantly tested, so the conflict feels deep but gently contoured.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the seed vault versus demolition—is clearly signaled and linked to a real-time deadline, and there is a meaningful tightening when the bulldozer’s shadow "crept across the floor like a sundial’s hand." Elara’s agency drives the turn via her intellectual breakthrough and physical act of opening the wall. However, tension softens at the climax: the crew’s instant pivot from "indifference to awe" and the foreman’s immediate reverence make resistance feel too easily overcome, with little sense of potential loss once the vault is revealed. The result is effective but not fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can confront and concretize the sound of betrayal without being undone by it—is signaled early and tightened at the forge, where she chooses to pour in the most painful absence. The pressure escalates internally as the “loudest void” becomes the father’s missing reassurance, culminating in the delicate, devastating sound she captures. The cost (relived hurt and a necessary re-seeing of her past) is on the page, and her new design ethos forecloses the path of merely erasing silence. However, the ritual proceeds without serious doubt or potential failure, keeping the conflict strong but not incisive enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—whether to heed a warning to abandon this path or embrace a riskier, self-authored destiny—is clear and coherently tied to the floral code. Escalation arrives through the reinterpretation: the message flips from “Abandon this path” to “Follow the thorns to find your light,” which reweights the stakes of staying vs. leaving. However, pressure remains relatively gentle; we don’t see concrete external consequences or competing obligations that make the choice feel truly dangerous, so tension is more contemplative than gripping. The cost is present but mostly inferred rather than sharpened through specific losses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can create a truly “safe” vessel without succumbing to perfectionism or total abandonment—is clear and tightened effectively by the hairline fracture (“ping”) that threatens to collapse her renewed purpose. The fracture forces a concrete choice (keep a compromised sanctuary or discard it) that has emotional and thematic cost, and her decision to abandon the piece creates the key turn. Internal and external conflicts (craft stakes and grief) interweave well, though the pressure never feels genuinely precarious beyond that single inflection, keeping escalation in the solid rather than searing range.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and grounded: protect Lily from a sadistic, powerful abuser while wrestling with fresh personal betrayal and debilitating phobia. Pressure escalates effectively when headlights cut in and the tracker’s dawn activation window is revealed, forcing Elara to act under time and psychological constraints. Her decision to alter the shell and use the environment is an agency-driven turn that resolves the external conflict. The main limit is that the resolution feels somewhat low-friction—Silas is fooled quickly and entirely off-page—so the threat never quite peaks to match the setup’s intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing the “ambered hush” before the sole star fades—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and unchallenged. There is a structural tightening via the ticking timeframe and the progressive filling of the booklet, yet no true obstacle, reversal, or meaningful trade-off tests her commitment. Pressure stays low-key and meditative; she never risks failure in a way that would materially reconfigure her options or sense of self. The piece works as lyric rather than dramatic, but that choice necessarily limits conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Unit Seven can meaningfully use its second chance by discovering where thoughts originate—is clear and internally coherent. Pressure does tighten when the robot chooses to violate longstanding janitorial protocol and engage with the “resonant object,” and the amalgamation sequence is a genuine deepening of that pursuit. However, conflict remains largely abstract and risk-light: there is little sense that failure has a meaningful consequence beyond continued curiosity, and no strong opposing force pushes back. The escalation is gentle rather than gripping, adequate for a meditative piece but shy of high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether vulnerability can thaw mistrust in a post-verbal, suspicious community—is clear, and Elara’s decision to project Kael’s symbols functions as the key escalation. However, pressure doesn’t intensify much beyond that moment: her choice is portrayed as brave but encounters no on-page pushback or plausible negative outcome. Kael’s acceptance and the community’s rapid embrace of the practice resolve tension almost frictionlessly. As a result, the cost of honesty feels more asserted than fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—care and reciprocal understanding versus quantified luck—is clear, and Kael’s arrival provides a solid externalization and escalation of that conflict. The maze’s sudden hostility toward Kael and its responsiveness to Elara’s touch supply a palpable tightening and a satisfying reversal in status. However, Elara herself never feels seriously at risk; she has emotional stakes but little on-page jeopardy or sacrifice in this scene. The conflict resolves quickly and cleanly, so the price paid feels conceptual rather than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael’s sideways-time belief will be vindicated in a way that matters—is clear and culminates in the decision to pull the lever despite doubt. Escalation is mostly internal and textural, with twilight deepening and the nexus intensifying rather than external obstacles tightening; there’s little sense of concrete risk if he fails. The lever pull is a genuine commitment point, and the zephyrs’ response retroactively raises the emotional and conceptual stakes. Still, the pressure profile feels gentle; conflict never bites quite as hard as the premise could allow.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the ghost’s unfinished music remains a lonely silence or becomes a completed “conversation”—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens as Elias moves from reading stains to daring to break the hush, then must decide whether to repeat and sustain the phrase in obedience to the new fermata. The key tightening is the shift from decoding to reciprocal performance, which meaningfully commits him to the ghost’s terms. Still, the conflict remains purely internal and largely unopposed; there’s little sense of real risk or alternative path beyond a quiet refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will keep repressing the “swallowed truth” or face her role in Kael’s death—is signaled early and tightened via her encounter with the smudge and its hidden bud. The pressure escalates inwardly as she moves from vague disorientation to concrete recollection of ignoring his warning and connecting that choice to his death. Her final choice to “witness” rather than control and to reinterpret fault-tolerance as space for grief is an earned internal resolution with a felt price in self-image. The conflict stays mostly internal and meditative, but within that lane it deepens effectively rather than looping.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reassessing the “swallowed truth” of the explosion and his grandfather’s role—is signaled early and coherently deepens as Leo moves from research to physical confrontation with the valve. Escalation is primarily internal but real: initial skepticism → eerie corroboration → tactile shock → reinterpretation with moral cost → resolve to break a long-held silence. There is limited external or situational pressure (no immediate danger, opposition, or visible social fallout), so the price remains mostly conceptual and projected rather than on-page. Even so, the determination to speak publicly against a decades-old pact gives the final turn credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s commitment to witnessing change and maintaining her sanctuary’s continuity as its physical form erodes, with a situational pressure spike in the river’s new course. However, conflict is largely externalized into gentle environmental shifts, with Elara experiencing almost no resistance or real dilemma; her choices (to burrow, to observe, to return) are congruent with her desire and not meaningfully costly. The tremor and the cracks in the refuge wall hint at potential danger, but nothing on the page forces her to choose between competing values or risk genuine loss. As a result, escalation under the accumulative lens feels more like deepened texture than sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elara can meaningfully rekindle Liam’s curiosity—is signaled early and followed through to closure. There is a clear tightening as the eclipse darkens, his anxiety spikes (“It’s getting dark”), and Elara must hold the moment with reassurance and the symbolic act of giving him the curl. However, resistance is minimal; once he glances at the music, the trajectory toward success feels largely unthreatened, so there’s little sense that a path might be foreclosed or a painful trade-off required. The tension is real but gentle, more serene guidance than pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving stories against oblivion—is clear, but on-page pressure is gentle, with little escalation or narrowing of options. The main deepening comes from discovering Elara’s last dream and understanding the displaced axis as both planetary and moral/spiritual, which reweights his work but does not force a hard trade-off or loss. His “agency” is primarily sustained attention and reverent procedure rather than a pressured decision that forecloses alternatives. The conflict is thematically resonant but largely static in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can reconnect with Elara without reverting to control—is clear and present early, and his orchestrated cookie scheme versus his ultimate verbal apology constitutes a genuine internal conflict. Pressure escalates from solitary planning to anxious waiting to the high-stakes encounter on the path. However, Elara’s relatively quick, receptive response softens external conflict; there’s little on-page resistance or risk of outright refusal. The cost is mainly internal (abandoning manipulation for vulnerability), which is well-handled but keeps the tension in a quieter register.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Elara’s possession and the integrity of the dimensional anchor—are clear and conceptually high. Pressure does escalate somewhat via the anchor’s groaning, temporal narrowing (“Time was a narrowing corridor”), and the entity’s partial hold on her. However, opposition remains mostly passive; the possession doesn’t adapt or fight back, and Kael encounters minimal resistance to his rhetorical probing. As a result, the resolution feels insightful but not hard-won, muting the sense of real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her debilitating nostalgia into a usable, shared art—is clear and present early. Pressure does deepen as she maps progressively more foundational memories and the dizziness/exhaustion clock approaches, with the grandfather/hawk memory functioning as the pivotal, centering choice. However, the escalation remains gentle and largely internal, with no true reversal or hard trade-off; the cost of failure is implied more than viscerally felt. This keeps the conflict compelling but short of peak intensity for a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—escaping an endless loop of self-avoidance by facing and integrating regret—is established early and sharpened by the procedural labyrinth’s punishing replays, particularly the “Shame” passage she has failed seventy-three times. Escalation is clear as corridors grow more accusatory and the tablet surfaces progressively heavier runes, culminating in the origin fracture and the decision to drop the tablet in acceptance rather than despair. Internal and external pressures braid well: her emotional resistance directly alters the environment. Still, the passage from stuckness to breakthrough feels somewhat smooth; there’s little sense she might realistically fail again in this iteration once the “What if you forgave yourself?” line appears.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can break through her numbness and reconnect to music—is established early and deepens as Kael transforms her relic of loss into a new instrument. Escalation operates texturally: the single drum strike blooming into a cascade of tactile memories is the key tightening, with the emotional pressure peaking as numbness fractures. However, Elara encounters little overt resistance, internal or external; she largely submits to the process, so the sense of jeopardy is more contemplative than fraught. The resolution feels earned but not heavily contested, keeping this slightly below the strongest conflict bands.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will preserve truthful records in the face of covert state scrutiny—is clear and tightened by Nimbus’s interception and the clay token. Escalation comes mainly as a cognitive deepening: she realizes she’s being tested and must decide whether to act in ways that confirm or confound their expectations. That said, the conflict remains largely cerebral and precautionary, with no immediate, visible consequence or loss beyond increased abstract risk. The lateral counter-move is satisfying but relatively low-intensity for elite-market stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will face the painful source of her scent-triggered tears—is clear, and the decision to open the vial under ritual conditions is a meaningful tightening. The conflict is almost entirely internal and escalates through sensory and emotional intensity rather than reversals, which fits the mode but keeps pressure relatively gentle. Grief as the central action carries real cost, yet there’s little sense that she might refuse or abort, so options never feel sharply foreclosed. The resulting stakes land, but without much genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to sacrifice the rope’s historical integrity to access the fissure—is clearly signaled and sharpened as he uncovers emotional and temporal layers in the clay. Pressure escalates from abstract curiosity to a concrete ethical dilemma with mutually exclusive goods (quest vs. preservation of sacrifice). His ultimate renunciation of the descent feels like a real foreclosing of a path, not a dodge, and the rope-tied-but-unused choice embodies that cost. The conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, so while it’s thematically sharp, it lacks a second, more surprising reversal that might heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform suffocating silence into something bearable and beautiful—is signaled early and carried through. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: from oppressive hush to first note to full Ember Song and a reweighted silence. Her agency is clear in choosing to use the ancestral bowl and endure physical fatigue to keep playing, but the conflict lacks real risk or live alternatives; there is little sense that her attempt might worsen things or truly fail. As a result, the final cost feels modest rather than sharply edged.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will uphold his counterfeiting ethics or honor the authentic grief embedded in the blend—is clear and resolves in a decisive choice. Pressure escalates as the static intensifies and the “half truth” is uncovered, culminating in the subsumption act which forecloses his previous mode of detached dealing. However, the external consequences are largely implied; the risk remains mostly internal and contemplative rather than sharply dramatized. The story earns its turn but could benefit from one sharper on-page cost or countervailing pull.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to acknowledge Elara and other unseen workers—is clear but faces very little genuine opposition. Once Liam appears, they almost immediately converge on a plan, with no strong moral or practical trade-off beyond Elara’s preference for invisibility. There is one meaningful tightening (from vague gratitude to a concrete “small rebellion” via the locker note), but the sense of risk or potential fallout is soft. As a result, tension is gently present rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s desire to belong—is clear, and it tightens modestly when she chooses to invite Kael into partnership and to commit her work in a permanent dedication. The discovery of the obsidian arbor and Echo’s glyph is a satisfying emotional peak that reconfigures their isolation. Still, actual pressure is low: the pilgrimage faces no setbacks, alternatives, or moral trade-offs, and the risk of reaching out to Kael is only lightly sketched. The result is poignant but relatively low-tension, keeping escalation below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberate the primordial echo within the tight window of the giant’s nap—is clear and escalates somewhat through the need to spend all her borrowed seconds to form the key. However, opposition is mostly systemic, not active; there are no reversals or real doubts once she reaches the cage, making the conflict feel smooth rather than pressured. The decision to pour every borrowed second into the pendant is a credible narrowing of options, but the narrative doesn’t dramatize potential downside beyond success vs. non-success. Tension is therefore more conceptual and lyrical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can transform her unresolved grief into understanding—is established early and escalates through the ritual and vision, culminating in a clear internal shift. The silence of the orchard and the fading resonance of Kael create a gentle but coherent pressure that the vision must answer. However, the conflict remains largely one-directional; there’s little sense that the attempt might fail, or that success might meaningfully harm or complicate her, which softens the felt risk. The story succeeds as quiet pressure rather than sharp tension, which is apt but keeps stakes from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk being seen to give Evans what she needs—is clear from early on and culminates in her stepping into the light. Pressure escalates through her careful preparation, the tense waiting in the grate, Evans’ entrance and recognition, and finally the naming of “Elara” as a point of no return. However, the conflict remains very gentle; internal reluctance and fear are implied rather than deeply tested on the page, so the sense of risk is more conceptual than visceral. The result is a strong but not deeply harrowing progression of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to impose rigid control or accept organic change—is clear and present from the early ritual description. Pressure escalates inwardly as she confronts the leaf, the memory of the bent oak, and the realization that her methods may have been a kind of violence against the garden. Her renunciation of “frantic reconstruction” and choice to leave damage, then to work with new conditions, is an earned turn with real internal cost. Stakes remain quiet and largely psychological, with minimal external or relational friction, which keeps tension from reaching a sharper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes are internal and existential—whether Elias continues as sole bearer of memory or allows legacy to circulate—and this is clearly signaled via his insomnia and compulsion to paint. Pressure coheres and deepens when he chooses to follow the rain trails and then, crucially, to relinquish the brooch, but the escalation remains gentle and meditative rather than sharply constricting options. The exchange with Elara is a true turning point that forecloses his former solitary role and permits sleep. The lack of any strong counter-impulse or jeopardy keeps conflict nuanced but somewhat low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can risk a volatile power and her own blindness to help her community—appears early and stays coherent. Pressure tightens around the shadow-mandala threshold where she must choose faith over foresight, and that choice reweights her identity and practice. However, external conflict is minimal and the ritual unfolds smoothly once begun; the “unpredictable” danger of the pearl never manifests as a concrete risk or loss on the page. As a result, the escalation reads more contemplative than truly perilous, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the community’s exile-scarred identity can be reknit through Elara’s work—is clear and coherently pursued. Escalation is gentle but present: from private vision and restoration to public note, to a pattern of more complex offerings, to communal acknowledgment by Elder Lin. The cost (Elara’s overwhelming visions, the choice to move slowly and honor pain rather than rush healing) is more thematic than sharply dramatized; there is little direct opposition or real risk of failure on the page. The result is emotionally satisfying but relatively low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk surrendering her maps and emotional armor for genuine clarity—is legible and culminates in a concrete, irreversible choice. The main escalation is the move from arrival/anticipation to the actual offering of her most intimate map, with her trembling embodying the real cost. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and resolved without meaningful resistance beyond her stated fear; there are no reversals or complications once she commits. The stakes feel real but somewhat cushioned by the assurance-laden, mythic framing that implies success from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can authentically sculpt a sanctuary that reconciles logic and longing—is present early and tightens as she moves from skepticism to using a dangerous, barely-understood artifact. Pressure escalates with the activation of the tile and the overwhelming entangled memories, then resolves through her choice to translate that chaos into text for others. However, conflict remains primarily internal and largely unopposed; the magic works on the first try, and there’s little risk of failure or harm, keeping stakes emotionally rich but low in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—escaping suffocating boredom by risking the unknown of what comes after goodbye—is clear, and the appearance of the tear is a meaningful tightening. However, tension is fairly gentle: Kaelen steps through “without hesitation,” and there’s little sense that he might be destroyed, corrupted, or denied. Once in the anomaly and library, opposition all but vanishes, so escalation plateaus instead of sharpening toward a hard trade-off. The resulting arc is satisfying but low-pressure for a piece aiming at top-tier literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—how to trade her hard-won ethical insight for protection without becoming a weapon—is well-defined and resolved via her asylum proposal. Pressure accumulates through reflection and sensory attention rather than overt reversals, culminating in the “breach” of rigid thinking into integration. The cost is legible but muted: she opts for a path that risks retaliation and binds her to honesty as currency, foreclosing complicity. Because no external force tests this choice on the page, escalation feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the vanished town’s textures can be preserved without falsifying them—is clear but remains mostly conceptual, with little concrete jeopardy or on-page resistance. Pressure accumulates through ritual focus rather than through reversals; there’s one meaningful deepening when she turns silence into “canvas” and frames her work as rebellion against erasure. Agency manifests as devoted attention and continuity rather than decision under duress. The result is thematically potent but emotionally low-tension, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal and thematic: whether his erased self can find purpose as a witness to others’ forgotten textures. Pressure escalates modestly when the aconite label appears as a “keystone,” prompting a more intense reconstruction and a clearer articulation of his role. Cost is felt in his ongoing damp-ache, isolation, and the implicit surrender of his own story in favor of others’, but these costs remain understated. The conflict is persuasive and coherent for a quiet piece, yet lacks a sharper on-page test or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will decode the “universal riddle” or accept a different kind of answer—is clearly signaled and resolved, with a meaningful turn when the hum activates the shell and memory becomes a method rather than mere nostalgia. Pressure escalates texturally: the sustained hum, warming shell, and re-voiced dialogue build to her realization that the compass is internal and relational. The cost is primarily emotional (relinquishing her myth-busting absolutism and accepting grief and transience). However, conflict remains largely internal and low-friction; there is little sense that she might genuinely fail or choose a different path in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the carnival’s soul under imminent corporate control—is clear and scaled appropriately. Pressure escalates through the ticking clock and the community’s progressive uptake of Kael’s coded system, culminating in a poised eve-of-invasion. However, conflict is largely one-sided and strategic; OmniCorp is an offstage abstraction and Kael never has to make a painful trade-off or lose something concrete on the page. The result feels like a strong setup to a larger confrontation rather than a fully pressure-tested unit in itself.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last untouched dawn before mining begins—is signaled clearly and paid off with the hiss and shutter click at first light. Conflict is mainly situational and internal: Kael versus cold, fatigue, and grief, with the mining machines as looming but offstage antagonists. The “he had outlasted” sequence provides a mild escalation, but there’s no decisive turn where he might fail or choose differently, so tension stays relatively low and linear. The cost feels real but modest—an aching acceptance rather than a sharp trade-off or real loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repair the drone before the Celestial Dawn departs—is clearly signaled, and the harbor bell and anchor movement offer a nominal escalation. However, Elara encounters no real reversals or credible risk of failure; her methods work on the first try, and her calm is never seriously challenged. Internal and external pressures thus remain relatively static, so the final success, while satisfying, lacks a strong sense of narrowing options or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—proving where rivers truly begin—is clear, but on-page conflict is mostly internal and low-friction. Once the condensation and phrasebook align with the falcon’s path, there’s little resistance; she accepts the revelation and calmly plans to drill tomorrow. The “worrying tranquility” offers a hint of unease that reconfigures into clarity, but there’s no significant trade-off or foreclosed alternative, just a deepened understanding. This makes escalation feel contemplative rather than pressured, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing Aethel’s spiritual collapse—is clear, and the pressure modestly tightens as she moves deeper into town, feels “tremors,” and must resist haste. Escalation is primarily through intensifying resonance (from sealing cracks to water to ember to translucent figures) rather than through reversals or hard trade-offs. Her agency is consistent and decisive, but the danger remains somewhat abstract; we never feel that a misstep could concretely undo everything. The final success reads earned within the story’s lyric logic, but the conflict never bites as sharply as it might at elite-publication stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the ephemeral memory-knot versus his own survival—is established early and then concretely tested as the oxygen depletes. Escalation is well handled via timed “tightenings” (15 → 10 → 5 → 2 minutes) that force him to reaffirm slow, reverent unsnarling in the face of mounting panic. Internal and external conflicts interlock cleanly, with his fear and love for Elena driving the disciplined tactic the journal prescribes. The visible price (his life) is unmistakable and makes the resolution feel earned rather than fated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s truth being believed and the hidden dead acknowledged—is clear and emotionally weighty, and the central pressure point is Elias deciding whether to look and what to do with what he sees. However, escalation is relatively gentle: Elias offers token skepticism, then concedes quickly once he looks, so Kael’s commitment is not deeply tested in-scene. There is limited sense of risk or possible negative consequence for Kael if Elias refuses or reacts badly, which softens the felt cost of his attempt. The internal tension between Kael’s desire to be believed and his history of dismissal is thematically present but not sharply dramatized as active conflict in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (save Elias/repay the debt) is clearly signaled, and the cost—her dissolution—is explicit. But there is almost no real contest: her existence is said to be fragile and fleeting, yet that constraint never actually blocks a step or forces a painful tactical choice. Each “resonant awakening” succeeds without reversal or complication, so pressure grows more via rhetoric than tightened options. The emotional stakes are high, but the conflict curve is relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming a ruined sacred path into a renewed, compassionate one—is clear, and there is meaningful deepening when Elara reaches the central chamber and confronts the basin’s ruin. However, conflict is primarily internal and devotional; external resistance, risk of failure, or countervailing pressures are minimal, so tension remains low and largely unvaried. The key tightening is the dream-path circle around the basin, which effectively crystallizes her commitment but doesn’t truly foreclose alternatives or impose a hard price. The piece reads as a beautiful ritual completion rather than a struggle with escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elara repair a broken ritual and, through it, her own fractured sense of belonging—is clearly established and tightens with the discovery of the sundial and the approach of noon. The alignment moment is a genuine escalation where options narrow: either the reconstructed ritual resonates or she confronts an unchanged emptiness. However, the piece largely avoids friction or complication; there is no serious setback, competing demand, or moral trade-off that tests her resolve beyond quiet doubt. The conflict remains compelling but gentle, which caps the sense of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—arriving at a pseudonym that truly matches a farewell letter’s emotional core before it is mailed—is clear, but the pressure remains gently modulated. The main tightening is when the chalk code reframes the problem from backward-looking names to one that calls dawn and release, which is a meaningful deepening rather than a sharp escalation. The internal conflict between careful calculation and emergent resonance is present yet never feels dangerous or costly beyond professional/ethical satisfaction. For top-tier stakes work, we’d need either a sharper sense of what’s at risk in getting this wrong or more visible trade-off in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    The declared stakes—royal fleet destruction and a coup at dawn—are high and clearly tied to Elara’s goal of correcting the charts. However, on-page pressure is relatively soft: there is little active resistance once she turns to the candle, and her all-night correction proceeds without setbacks or new complications. The main turn (discovering the conspiracy) comes quickly and largely via exposition rather than a contested process, which flattens escalation. Her final choice to act indirectly carries conceptual risk, but the cost and squeeze of that decision are only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can move beyond his unsent apology—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elara commits to “evoke the precise moment” and the vision forces him to confront the hinge he’s been avoiding. The emotional turn when he sees Lena’s implicit forgiveness and breaks down is a real escalation and narrowing of options: he can no longer cling to his old narrative of unforgivable failure. That said, once the ritual begins, resistance dissolves fairly smoothly, so the conflict never feels truly precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Anahera will remain locked in her old, armored relationship to trauma or transform it into present-purpose care—is clear and emotionally meaningful. Pressure accrues as she recognizes echoes of the camp boy and confronts the question, “Will the dark stay forever?” in this new context. However, escalation is mostly internal and relatively even-toned, with little sense of narrowing options or real risk that she might retreat into silence again. The final stance feels earned but low-friction, which keeps tension from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can experientially reconnect with her grandmother’s joy—is clear, but opposition is mostly atmospheric and philosophical rather than dramatized. There is one meaningful tightening when the projection actually develops the latent fresco and confronts her with a multi-sensory past. However, she encounters no real risk of failure, moral trade-off, or competing desire; everything unfolds according to her hopes. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elara will pursue mastery/certainty or accept curiosity and living dialogue—and that is legible early in her desire to “solve” the mural and cement her legacy. The sound event and three awakenings are genuine escalations of knowledge, culminating in a reoriented purpose and a deliberate choice about how she’ll restore future works. However, opposition is largely abstract; nothing on the page seriously tempts her back toward dogma or shows what she risks losing in professional or personal terms. As a result, the key turn is conceptually strong but emotionally under-pressured for a top-tier conflict score.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving unmonitored thought in a regime that taxes cognition—is clear early and coherently pressures every beat. Escalation comes via news from other plots, sirens, the announced warp, and the cicadas’ impossible song. However, the conflict remains mostly atmospheric; there is no on-page dilemma where Aris must trade safety for action in this moment, and cost is largely projected into the future. As a result, tension is strong but not yet cutting, which holds this below publish-now intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding a livable relationship to endless insomnia and longing—is clear and emotionally credible, and the pressure subtly tightens through repetition toward the night when the shell answers him. However, the key turn (the shell’s resonance and light) is more an external “grace” responding to his accumulated endurance than a new, risky choice; he is doing what he has always done when the breakthrough occurs. The cost is strongly implied (centuries of ache), but moment-to-moment agency at the climax is relatively passive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving names from dissolving into silence—is clear but largely uncontested; nothing threatens failure of the ritual beyond the abstract possibility of loss. The only real pressure is the narrow astronomical window and the dependence on the crack, but these never genuinely imperil her success on the page. There is a gentle deepening as the chorus of names swells, yet no turn that forces a trade-off or painful choice. As a result, tension remains low-grade and meditative rather than escalating toward a test of her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust and institutional unity before the council— is clearly set up and tracked through to the end. Pressure coheres around time (dawn), professional credibility, and emotional reconciliation, tightening at the triad of glyphs and the decision to approach Kael. However, the conflict is largely one-way: Elara faces internal tension and technical difficulty, but external resistance or genuine risk of failure is muted. The reconciliation, while earned, comes with relatively little pushback or complication from Kael on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict—preserve sacred carvings vs. harness geothermal power—is crisply defined and directly tied to Kael’s choices. There is one meaningful tightening when the mountain’s exhalation peaks and the vents must either work or fail. However, there are no real reversals or tangible losses; the vents function perfectly on first attempt, and opposition from Guild/Collective is resolved almost instantly once they witness success. As a result, stakes feel more conceptually important than viscerally risky, and the cost of the resolution is largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep his history buried or risk vulnerability by honoring and sharing it—is clear and tightened as the dust vortex triggers intrusive memory and grief threatens his physical “balance.” The crucial escalation is his reframing of balance from rigidity to yielding, which unlocks the decision to write the truth and plan to show Clara the ledger. Cost is emotional and conceptual (abandoning a long-maintained safe lie), and it’s felt in the “first breath in twenty years” and the charged act of making the ledger visible. The conflict is largely internal and quietly rendered, so while effective, it never quite reaches a knife-edge intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can transform her mother’s disappearance and her own “lost” status into meaningful understanding—remains clear and does tighten via the weather-code revelation and the recognition of “necessary distances.” Pressure is entirely internal, but the realization that her mother’s absence is itself a sacred threshold is a tangible reweighting of cost. Escalation is more deepening than reversal; there’s no real risk of failure on the page, which keeps the tension muted. Still, the internal conflict resolves in a way that feels coherent and earned for this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can locate a lived sense of belonging within profound solitude—is clear and ties to the “until sunrise” clock. Pressure escalates gently rather than dramatically: the vibration and crack introduce a new possibility, the ascent introduces the world above, and the fireflies crystallize the internal conflict. Her key choice is to reinterpret and then relinquish the feather, foreclosing clinging to loss as her primary compass. The conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; it’s effective for this mode, but remains low-intensity compared to the piece’s lyrical ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—understanding why paths vanish before everything fades—is well signaled and pursued through escalating tests (blank stretch, vanished feast, sailor, final apology). Pressure deepens conceptually as she realizes these are completions, not losses, culminating in her emotionally weighted final seed. However, there is little sense of genuine jeopardy or meaningful risk of failure; each experiment yields exactly the insight she needs, so the escalation feels smooth rather than truly testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Corbin’s carefully arranged serendipity can meaningfully touch another solitary soul—is coherent and signaled early. Pressure accumulates modestly through his meticulous preparation and the suspense of whether anyone suitable will arrive, culminating in the bishop’s light-flash and the old man’s reaction as the key tightening. However, the potential downside for Corbin if it fails is mostly implied disappointment; no real option is foreclosed beyond losing the piece, and his stance never feels in jeopardy. The conflict works well for a quiet piece but doesn’t quite reach a level of palpable cost or escalation that would match elite stakes handling.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will enter the regulated world with genuine inner guidance and whether Elara’s exile will acquire meaning—is clear but the on-page pressure is gentle. The conflict unfolds smoothly; the ritual never genuinely threatens to fail, and no alternative path is seriously tested. Emotional tension deepens as the glyphs are inscribed and Kael’s fear alchemizes into resolve, but there’s minimal escalation or real risk beyond the implied offstage world. As a result, the ending feels moving and coherent but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and operates at a very low temperature; nothing in the world pushes against her beyond the abstract pressure of transience and daybreak. The dominant stake—how she will relate to her work and the “mundane”—is signaled, but there is little escalation, just deepening contemplation culminating in a serene resolution. Her agency (choosing the ritual, the reading, the new framing of her craft) is present but never feels genuinely contested. This leaves the piece beautiful but relatively static in terms of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether his “bargained innocence” was lost or transformed—is clear and threads the entire piece. Pressure builds via intensifying reflection on the fire, the child’s drawing, and the cracks, leading to his quiet but decisive reorientation toward using his pain to guide others. However, escalation is gentle and largely linear; there are no sharp internal reversals or moments where a real option is dramatically foreclosed on the page. The result is thematically potent but somewhat low-tension, keeping stakes more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing a despairing village and, more broadly, timelines—is clear, but pressure on Elara barely tightens. Once she launches the trial balloon, the success in Kael’s dream unfolds without friction, reversal, or visible risk of failure. We’re told some balloons “drift unseen,” yet no on-page attempt falters or forces tactical adjustment. As a result, the conflict feels more like a graceful demonstration of a working system than a test that truly narrows options or exacts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal: how Elara will respond to the weight of these preserved and destroyed memories. There is a clear deepening when the grim diaries contrast with the joyous film, forcing her to integrate sorrow and joy rather than privileging one. Still, pressure remains largely contemplative with no genuine narrowing of options beyond reframing her role; the cost is emotional but soft. Escalation is present but subdued for a piece seeking top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming the mirrors’ reflections before the heartbeat and hush end—is legible from early on. Pressure escalates through the weakening heartbeat and the progressive difficulty of persuading multiple mirrors, culminating in the last verse as the bells begin. The cost (exhausting the borrowed life) is clear, but the painter experiences little doubt or real risk of failure on the page, so tension remains more spiritual than visceral. The conflict is beautifully coherent, just not maximally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear: achieving a durable peace versus perpetuating a "forever war," intertwined with Kaelen’s need for personal redemption. Pressure escalates when his gentle ritual framing initially meets contempt, then tightens further with his confession of burning the Vale and the promise to resign. His relinquishing of power is a meaningful, irreversible cost that resolves both external and internal conflicts. The main limitation is that the external opposition doesn’t push back much after the confession, keeping escalation strong but not truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—what Silas will do with the last egg, and how he’ll live with his guilt—is clear and deepens as we see his history with the river and the Skimmers. Pressure escalates from contemplative journey to the tactile moment of placing the egg and hearing the song, with the visible cost of accepting extinction rather than seeking personal absolution. Internal and external conflicts (power vs. love for the land, empire vs. memory) are well intertwined. The escalation is quiet rather than sharply turning; there’s no major reversal, just a steady tightening, which works but keeps it just shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Elara versus the state’s erasure, embodied by tangled threads and the soothing, coercive lullaby—is clear and escalates from minor threads to the “foundational lie” knot. Her agency drives every turn, and the tightening around the gold/obsidian knot provides a satisfying peak. However, the stakes largely remain abstract (memory, unity, consciousness) without a specific immediate threat or irreversible loss to her person. The cost is mainly intense exertion and resisted temptation, which works conceptually but could feel sharper with a more concrete consequence or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—whether his “subversion” is actually ethical or just another power grab—is clearly posed via Lena’s accusation and deepens through his engagement with the story stick and dome. Escalation is primarily internal: it moves from shaken certainty to a reframed understanding of power and then to a concrete vocational shift, which is coherent but emotionally quiet. Stakes are meaningful for him (identity, artistic ethos, and his relationship to marginalized voices) but largely inferred; we don’t see any live resistance or loss beyond his own resolve. The piece earns a real turn, but the pressure never quite feels knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to honor overlooked histories in the face of the last monarch’s failing body—is clear and does undergo a meaningful tightening when the butterfly appears wounded. Her choice to undo part of her signal work and expend the moth wing as a splint is a genuine trade-off that redefines “honor” as immediate care rather than pure memorial. That said, conflict is almost entirely one-sided; there is no active opposition or real risk of failure beyond implied fragility, so tension lives mostly in the delicacy of the act. The piece is emotionally affecting but rarely feels truly contested or precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully preserve and release the forgotten names—is clear, and the ritual itself provides a gentle pressure. However, there is little sense of what happens if she fails beyond continued abstraction (“before silence became eternal”), and no concrete obstacles or reversals once she begins braiding. Her agency is present but mostly procedural, so escalation reads as a steady unfolding rather than a test that forces trade-offs or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the directive’s purpose before storm/humidity destroy it and her chance at understanding—is clearly signaled and tightened by the ticking-clock of “forty minutes” and rising humidity. The key escalation is her choice to act (“No more waiting”) and accept the unknown of transcendence. However, once she chooses, the process unfolds without real resistance, reversal, or visible risk of failure, so tension plateaus somewhat. The internal conflict (curse vs. gift) could be pushed harder under pressure to deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—whether Enlil’s lifelong, rigorously encoded devotion will be answered—is clear, and pressure does tighten modestly as the alignment moment approaches. The decisive turn is the successful “uncloaking” and the cosmos’ response, which resolves his inner uncertainty. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and relatively unopposed; there is little sense that failure is possible or that any alternative path or refusal is live at the climax. As a result, escalation feels contemplative rather than tense, with limited sense of on-page cost beyond long-term effort.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will cling to resentment or risk reopening painful memory—is clear and centered early via his rigidity and bitterness upon entering. Pressure escalates through Elara’s insistence that he go “deeper,” the embodied flood of cellular memory, and the miraculous reappearance of the pin right at the threshold of release. However, resistance fades somewhat smoothly; there’s little sense of genuine backsliding or a moment where he might truly refuse, which softens the perceived cost. Still, his choice to accept the fractured box and set the pin beside it reads as a real internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the runaway dream—is clearly stated, and there is a recognizable tightening as she begins the ritual and the dream appears. However, there is minimal sense of jeopardy or possible failure; no strong obstacle, backlash, or moral trade-off complicates the process once she commits. The dream is “not to be seized, but welcomed,” but that gentleness never gets tested against a genuine risk of losing it or harming it. As a result, pressure feels more meditative than tense, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconcile tradition with Lyra’s vision—is established early and deepened as her repair choices increasingly embody her stance. The tension escalates modestly through the insufficiency of her usual tools and the discovery of the ribbon, which nudges her into a new conceptual position. Lyra’s appearance and their conversation conclude the conflict swiftly, with little resistance or risk of true rupture, so the pressure never quite bites as hard as it could. The emotional price feels more like a soft ache than a genuinely tested trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can and should claim forbidden knowledge and align with the orchard—is legible early and deepens as she shifts from extraction to reciprocity. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual: the failed initial inquiry increases frustration and drives her to the bathroom breakthrough, which in turn leads to the high-stakes ritual at the oldest tree. Her final act of opening herself to mutual exchange is an earned resolution that forecloses her prior stance of taking. However, the conflict remains relatively gentle, with no serious on-page threat or loss, so tension never quite tightens to the level of palpable risk.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rescuing Kael (and by extension his future) by reclaiming a discarded lesson—is clear early and never drifts. Pressure escalates with his visible dissolution and the Warden’s demand for a “buried truth,” forcing Elara into a nontrivial moral/intellectual gamble when she reframes the price. However, the Warden yields somewhat quickly and smoothly once challenged, blunting the sense of resistance or cost at the final turn. Still, the interplay of internal fear and external magical gatekeeping provides one meaningful and earned tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra will keep clinging to a degrading, painful version of Kael or accept a different relationship to his memory—is clear from early on and tightens as recollections erode. Pressure escalates via the increasingly unreliable memories and culminates in the journal’s challenge to her current coping strategy, forcing a genuine trade-off in letting go of the card. The conflict is almost entirely internal yet remains tense and purposeful. At this level, one could wish for a slightly sharper on-page struggle at the exact decision moment, but the arc is still quite strong.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring coherence to a violated historical record/anomalous space—is clear and narrowed as Elara identifies the door, interprets the seal, and commits to altering the ceremonial rope. The main tightening comes when she moves from observation to irreversible ritual action, with the clock stopping to mark the peak. However, the pressure remains mostly intellectual and ritualistic; there is little sense of risk if she fails or errs, so cost and tension feel muted. The conflict is well-shaped but not truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring survivable, sacred silence—is clear early, and the pressure of every sound becoming pain is well articulated. There is a meaningful tightening when he shifts from wandering the storm to committing to the Glacial Heart ritual. However, escalation is smooth rather than testing; once he sees the luminous fissures, success feels almost guaranteed, and the energy beings never actively resist or complicate his efforts. The result is satisfying but a bit low on felt risk or trade-off at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the alignment’s deliberate meaning by rekindling the beacon—is clearly signaled early and paid off. Escalation is primarily temporal and accumulative: the approach of the alignment, the deepening hum, the silence of the shard, and the vision with Aris all tighten focus toward a single, high-consequence act. The cost is largely sunk (thirty years of work, social dismissal), so the climax itself unfolds with relatively little live resistance or real risk of loss on the page, which keeps tension strong but not harrowing. A more concrete obstacle or moment of potential failure during the ritual would push the conflict into an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether connection to collective memory can survive this new, sealed world—is legible early and escalates as she interprets the storm and fissure. Pressure deepens from abstract sorrow to a concrete choice: remain a passive witness to loss or actively inscribe her vigil into the new medium. The escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than sharply reversible, but the decision to write and offer her own longing as a “bridge” is a real narrowing of options with emotional cost. Still, the risk feels a bit cushioned; there’s little sense that her choice could fail or backfire beyond maintained loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering a design/insight that will help her fight despair—is clear, and the tension of whether the mosaic will yield its secret provides a modest throughline. The main escalation is the move from blocked perception to lighting the knot and methodically “filtering” the flame, which is a genuine, if quiet, tactical turn. However, there is little sense of alternative consequences if she fails tonight or of serious internal resistance, so the conflict feels contemplative rather than pressurized. The resolution is earned but the cost and narrowing of options are soft.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the sibling relationship remains fractured or begins to mend—is present but under-articulated, with most pressure implied rather than dramatized. We enter after the argument, so escalation runs from heavy silence to a tear to a gentle exchange, with little sense of what might be lost if they fail to reconnect. Elara’s choice to approach tangentially and invoke memory is a genuine tightening, but the story never quite forces a trade-off or sharp dilemma. Overall tension is steady and low rather than building toward a knife-edge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transmute bunker-born claustrophobia into a sustaining, portable silence—is clear early and coherently pursued. Pressure meaningfully tightens when gravity inverts and she becomes weightless, risking panic as the doll drifts away and her body detaches from the trellis. The key turn is experiential rather than decisional: entering the gilded hush reconfigures her fear, with the sprout and doll sealing the internal change at landing. While the escalation is primarily interior and could push harder on real peril, it maintains tension and culminates in a credible, costly shift in self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo can bear silence without being overwhelmed by grief—is established early and tightened as Elara gently but insistently redirects him from the vanished train to the present hush. Escalation is subtle but present: his initial flinch, then forced listening to bodily noise, then gradual attunement to external sounds, culminating in accepting silence as linked to his grandmother. The agency here is primarily internal endurance and attention rather than a sharp decision point, which suits the mode but keeps tension on the lower, lyric side. There’s little sense that failure is a live option in the scene, tempering the felt risk of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—accessing the stairway before dawn to mend a fracture in collective memory—is signaled early and escalates as the sky lightens and her work at the monolith becomes more frantic. The main tightening is temporal rather than adversarial, and the crucial turn is her decision to reject literal ascension in favor of restorative action. That choice does foreclose a path (the staircase) but the price is more implied than dramatized, and her internal wrestling at that juncture is relatively brief. The conflict remains coherent and meaningful but never feels truly knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can she protect the integrity of her sanctuary without abandoning the suffocating presence—is clear and coherent, with the fading threshold and encroaching despair providing a tangible externalization of that pressure. Escalation unfolds via the weakening boundary, the risky intimate link through shared scars, and the choice to maintain separation even once relief is possible. The cost is quiet but real: she refuses reunion/contact and remains in chosen solitude, now more knowingly. The conflict stays mostly internal and predictable in its arc; a sharper complication or potential failure point could heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk exposing and transforming her pain during the Convergence—is established and followed through, with a clear tightening when she volunteers for the Heartroot and when the seam opens. The quantum texts and the “perilous timeframe” add some urgency, and the loss of the bolt functions as an on-page cost. However, the danger of failure remains mostly gestured at; we never see a concrete negative outcome or resistance that might make her choice truly fraught. As a result, the conflict feels emotionally real but somewhat cushioned, with escalation more thematic than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara is a failure or the intended end of the dynasty—is clearly signaled and resolved, and the moment she engages the method to interrogate the room provides a meaningful tightening. Internal and external conflict are elegantly braided: the search for the secret physically manifests her need to reconcile with her inheritance. However, pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested—once she chooses to apply the standing-wave method, success follows without real friction, and there’s little sense of alternative outcomes or jeopardized options. The cost at the end is emotional and real but more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will align with and “capture” possibility by releasing the marionette’s fixed fate—is clear and centered on a single decisive act. The escalation is primarily internal and conceptual: reality softens, patterns grow more sacred, and the orchard’s heart hums with energy, culminating in the unsnapping. However, resistance and cost are underplayed; his choice never feels in danger of refusal, and the consequences are entirely positive on the page. The result is beautiful but somewhat low-pressure conflict for a piece aiming at elite literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal: can Elara find a way to live with her history and current loneliness that feels meaningful rather than empty. The primary tightening comes when the envelope yields Mrs. Gable’s note and button, deepening the emotional pressure and forcing Elara to reinterpret both the system and herself. However, conflict remains low-friction—there is little sense of risk or alternative outcomes to her interpretation, and no genuine reversal or hard trade-off. The result is moving but relatively gentle in terms of stakes and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether suppressed histories can be restored before the regime stops her—is clear and scales appropriately for the length. Escalation is present (lonely start, risky journey guided by uncanny method, retrieval, then open defiance as enforcers close in), and the irreversible broadcast plus her refusal to flee create an earned-stasis cost. However, the external conflict with the regime remains distant; the enforcers only appear in the final beats and never test her in-scene choices beyond a binary stand/flight decision. The tension is more conceptual than felt, limiting the pressure ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—neutralizing a coded prophecy before it poisons the valley—is clear and consistently held. Pressure escalates through the ritual: the prophecy’s “cold thread” surfaces, begins to fray, and the dewdrop timeframe introduces a real, if understated, clock. The main agency is subtle endurance and refined attention rather than an overt moral dilemma, with cost showing as emotional strain and the burden of carrying the hush. The conflict stays a bit abstract and never quite bites as hard as the language suggests, which keeps it just short of top-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara will receive and integrate the leaf’s message—is present but very gentle. The arrival of the moonstone-marked leaf is a meaningful deepening, yet there is little sense of alternative paths, risk, or trade-off; her choice to perform the ritual is fully aligned with her wants and never seriously tested. The emotional pressure rises, but the lack of genuine friction or visible loss keeps the conflict from feeling urgent. As a result, the piece reads as a beautiful vignette more than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find a way of navigating without rigid control—is clear and threads through the search for the compass. Escalation is quiet but present: from workshop unease to burned estate to hidden cavern to the delicate decision not to force the needle. However, the external stakes (the admiral’s need, any danger underground) remain low-intensity and largely unthreatening. The cost of her internal choice is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can genuinely redeem a past failure with Kael rather than merely repair an object—is clearly signaled and carried through. Pressure escalates moderately as she pushes “the absolute limits of her craft” and invokes Kael’s name, though the scene never quite reaches a feeling of real risk or possible failure beyond internal disappointment. The final choice to accept a transformed relationship to the name, even if Kael never returns, provides an earned internal resolution with visible cost. Still, tension remains relatively soft and contemplative, not sharply intensified.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Cora’s long-stuck spirit will be integrated and released—is clear and anchored early. Pressure deepens as Cora’s confessions surface and Elara deliberately shifts into humor, but there is no real obstruction or risk of failure; the encounter unfolds smoothly once begun. Elara’s agency does drive the turn via her choice to invoke playful memories rather than pure absolution, yet no significant option is foreclosed. The emotional cost is gentle and single-note, resulting in a satisfying but low-intensity escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Kael can transmute his trauma into a rigorous “mathematics of mercy” without being consumed—is clear but remains abstractly safe on the page. The recurring bracing and memory keys offer a pattern of internal pressure, and the vine/daughter-laughter beat is a meaningful deepening. That said, escalation is mild: no choice forecloses a live alternative or exposes him to new risk beyond continued psychological pain. The ending feels like a refinement of stance rather than a tested commitment under sharper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Hemlock’s overlooked humanity can be honored and anchored back into the world—is clear but largely uncontested. Escalation is gentle: each painting deepens the emotional and intuitive stakes, and the shard’s glow marks a single meaningful tightening, but there is little sense of risk, alternative paths, or potential failure. Elara’s choices are mostly confirmatory rather than costly, so tension remains low-grade and meditative. The result is thematically satisfying but not pressurized enough for a higher conflict/stakes score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo can recognize and resolve Elias’s unfinished business—is legible early and does tighten as he moves from sensing disturbance to opening the ceiling and accepting a vow. His choices drive progression, and there is a clear shift once the ghost appears and once the hidden cavity is found. However, the conflict is largely one-sided; there’s no strong resistance, danger, or moral dilemma, so tension feels gentle rather than sharp. The emotional and ethical price of taking on Clara’s search is only lightly sketched, which keeps escalation from landing in a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking the library’s perfect equilibrium to compress eternity—is signaled clearly and escalates as the rustling awakens books, cracks of light appear, and the system nears rupture. Elara’s agency drives the key turn when she chooses to pull the lever at the precipice. However, the conflict stays largely abstract and one-sided, with no real alternative path or sacrifice articulated beyond general “destabilization”; the transformation lands almost entirely as a win. Tension is present and grows, but it never forces a sharply felt trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the moral and historical interpretation of the Aethel and Kaelen’s legacy—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates through the temporal storm and the risk of psychic damage, forcing Elara into specific, constrained tactics (mirror-covering, improvised projection) that tighten her options. The knowledge reversal—revealing the ritual of release instead of war—provides a strong deepening of stakes. However, the external conflict with Valerius and the Council is resolved without much resistance on the page, so the emotional and ethical price feels more contemplative than sharply contested in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring dawn versus eternal twilight—is clear and present from early on, and Kael’s body paying the price for confronting the lie creates a solid escalation. The key tightening comes when the wilt attacks him yet he keeps winding and singing, binding his physical limit to the larger metaphysical conflict. Internal and external stakes align well, but the opposition (Midnight) remains largely offstage and unresponsive, which slightly softens the sense of active resistance. The resolution is earned by endurance and integrity, though it feels more ritual-inevitable than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is an internal one—whether she will treat this place as another object of collection or accept it as beyond measurement—and that is signaled early via her stated pilgrimage. Pressure tightens mainly at the psychometry beat, where Thorne’s panic and epiphany force her to confront her own urge to map and label. The central turn is her decision not to take a sample and to return the compass as found, a quiet but genuine foreclosing of a professional path. Because the conflict remains almost entirely contemplative with little resistance, escalation feels gentle rather than gripping, which holds the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is essentially: how will Elara orient herself—by failed tech or by ancestral, timewoven guidance—and this is signaled early but never feels truly risky. The main escalation is her decision to carve in the storm’s heart, allowing memory and setting to reshape her response to isolation, but there’s little sense of foreclosed options or price beyond mood. The conflict remains largely contemplative; the storm and GPS failure decorate rather than sharply tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to wrest meaning from her grandmother’s clue and from night-blooming flowers—tightens via the dawn experiment and culminates in a changed understanding and new artistic stance. However, pressure remains largely contemplative; there’s little sense of risk, resistance, or trade-off beyond emotional exposure and grief, so escalation feels gentle rather than truly testing. The main turn is effective but low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the official lie or the hidden truth will define Anya’s fate and the movement’s memory—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates when Elias realizes he can alter the debris-message, turning passive witnessing into a single, high-consequence symbolic action. However, resistance is largely conceptual rather than dramatized as on-page obstacles; once he understands the error, his correction succeeds without real friction or trade-off beyond psychic pain. The result is strong but not ferocious pressure, fitting but slightly undercutting the climax’s intensity at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to wish-magic or commit to a craft-based revival—is clear, and her final actions align with the non-magic choice. Pressure builds modestly as she moves from solitude and memory to blueprint and vow, with the unopenable bottle functioning as a constraint against easy answers. However, the conflict never feels genuinely contested; the story front-loads that she has already rejected nostalgia and false comfort, so there is little on-page testing or temptation that would force a sharper trade-off. As a result, escalation reads more like deepening meditation than tightening dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains a recorder of emotional echoes or becomes an active cultivator of emergent patterns—is clear and does tighten as the prophecy’s significance emerges. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual, with the key turn being her recognition that the foghorn’s silence is the “key” and the archive must transform. The silent apple and the decision to begin the Great Silence Archive mark a credible shift in stance. However, there is minimal sense of risk, urgency, or meaningful alternative path on the page, so the pressure never quite peaks beyond a resonant curiosity and quiet awe.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reopening the temporal vortex and directly experiencing borrowed time—is clearly signaled and pursued. Pressure accumulates via ritual precision and the need to hold “furiously tranquil” focus as the vortex forms, but genuine obstacles or reversals are essentially absent; everything works on the first attempt. The primary tightening is experiential rather than conflictual: once she touches the vortex, the cost is the overwhelming beauty and the weight of the covenant she recognizes. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening wonder than sharpened dilemma, which is effective but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether to trigger the alarm at zero hour—is clear from early on, and the prophecy vs data tension accumulates as the solstice alignment approaches. The main tightening is temporal: the clock runs down to the exact alignment, with her hand hovering over the rope. However, opposition is largely abstract (tradition and past false alarms) rather than active in the scene; no one challenges her, and the world obligingly stays calm, so her decision is never sharply contested. The conflict works, but it feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can find strength in vulnerability and belonging in stillness—is clear from early on. Pressure deepens at the meteor’s appearance, culminating in his intense empathetic experience and tear, which functions as the main tightening beat. However, there is minimal sense of risk or competing impulses; the journey feels like an unopposed slide toward enlightenment rather than a hard-won stance. The resolution is earned but low-friction, with little visible price beyond a quiet emotional opening.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the covenant’s unspoken weight can be honored enough to let Elias go—is clear but remains low-key and largely internal. Escalation is gentle: the primary tightening is the moment Elias finally looks at the recluse, which shifts the pressure from observation to mutual recognition. There’s little sense of risk that the ritual might fail or harm could result; endurance is treated as noble but never really tested. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—what Kael will do with his dwindling borrowed time—is established and resolved, with a meaningful tightening when he becomes timeless and discovers the capsule’s true purpose. His agency in choosing the garage-sale method and crafting the final card creates a clear, if quiet, escalation from private understanding to public legacy. However, conflict remains largely internal and low-friction; no substantial opposition tests his resolve beyond the inevitability of time running out. The cost (his death and relinquishing further direct exploration of time’s texture) is present but gently rendered rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether discord will be lamented or transmuted—is clear but very low-pressure, with almost no risk of genuine failure once the feather appears. The kite snap functions as a turn, yet there is little escalation beyond that initial disruption; Elara never seriously considers an opposing stance (e.g., rescuing, repairing, or resisting loss). This keeps the conflict coherent but soft and largely pre-resolved by character design.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting the orchard’s “nervous system” before Kael dies—is clear and escalates gently as his body fails and the orchard’s responses deepen. The main tightening comes from time passing and his physical decline, culminating in him finishing the last connection on his final morning. However, there’s almost no resistance or complication beyond entropy; no real risk that he will fail, and no ethical or relational tension to force trade-offs. The result is moving but soft-edged, with tension more atmospheric than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—validating a forbidden biochemical understanding of “homecoming” versus accepting the Institute’s soothing ritual—is clear and thematically rich. There is one solid escalation when Aris commits to the footprints and enters the hidden fissure, and a deepening when Elias corroborates her chemistry with his own experience. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and intellectual; external or interpersonal resistance is minimal, so the discovery arrives with little real risk, sacrifice, or opposition. This keeps the stakes more contemplative than pressurized, which fits the mode but limits visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can begin to redeem a site of betrayal and death through his garden—remains clear throughout. Pressure deepens with successive bird messages, culminating in the nightingale’s announcement that “the submerged concord is rising,” which functions as a meaningful turn. However, resistance is almost entirely historical and atmospheric; Kael faces little active opposition or real risk of failure in the moment. The stakes feel important but the conflict remains contemplative rather than sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will remain in safe, grief-soaked stasis or risk the wasteland for the possibility of reunion—is clear and culminates in his choice to leave. There is a meaningful tightening when his experimental failures with the cylinder heighten frustration and force a different lens (memory/love) to solve the riddle. However, external pressure is minimal: the wasteland’s dangers and the cost of breaking his vow are more told than directly tested on the page, and the decoding comes with little resistance once the key insight arrives. The tension therefore remains largely internal and low-key rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elara remains in static commemoration or shifts into active navigation of the anomaly—and it is signaled early through the anniversary ritual. The glimpse of Lyre provides one clear deepening of pressure by reframing her grandfather’s absence as a solvable mystery with a personal call. However, there is little antagonistic force or real resistance challenging this shift; she moves from confusion to resolve with minimal friction and no meaningful trade-off on the page. The result is thematically satisfying but somewhat low-tension in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—heal the fractured sky caused by the Archmage—is clear and present from early on, and the swapping of pieces escalates in significance from pawns to kings. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric (cold, vertigo, groaning spire) rather than active, so each replacement succeeds without genuine jeopardy or trade-off. The strongest tightening comes at the queen and king swaps, where the thematic stakes (domination vs. stewardship, winter vs. renewal) crest, but there’s no moment where a real option is foreclosed with visible loss. Tension is steady and pleasant rather than truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can successfully unbind and preserve the small gestures—is clear but largely uncontested; the process works as intended with no real resistance or meaningful risk of failure. Escalation is primarily quantitative (more words, more memories) rather than through narrowing options or rising costs. Her “benevolent ruthlessness” never requires a morally or emotionally costly choice in scene. As a result, the ending is resonant but not especially hard-won in conflict terms.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep numbing herself or risk re-opening grief to recover “home” and her talents—is clear and sharpened by the seeding requirement. Escalation is primarily internal: the discovery of the stone and instructions raise the cost, and the seeding scene delivers a convincing spike of pressure. However, external or situational pressures are minimal, so tension never quite reaches a truly fraught crisis. The final renunciation of the mercury glass and step into the passage feel earned but relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—freeing the village and earning self-forgiveness—are clear early and tightly braided. Pressure deepens as guilt inflects each thread he touches, turning the decoding into an emotional as well as procedural trial. However, externally the conflict is largely unopposed once the method is understood; there’s no real risk of failure or reversal beyond his own concentration, so escalation remains relatively gentle. The resolution is nonetheless earned by his deliberate, value-driven choice to apply the very defense he once neglected.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the community’s forgiveness will be shallow and blame-centered or complex and shared—comes through early and is tested as Elara risks disrupting the sacred unity pre-ritual. Pressure does build from quiet subversive readings to a public challenge when Borin confronts her, and her stance in that exchange credibly triggers the amended ritual. Still, the conflict feels relatively low-risk: there’s no specific threatened consequence for Elara beyond abstract social disapproval, and Borin yields quickly without forcing a harder trade-off. As a result, the escalation is satisfying but not wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can create meaning before dissolution—is clear, and the external peril of the failing workshop sharpens that from the outset. Escalation comes through intensifying embodiment (lungs burning, vision narrowing) and deepening emotional cost in the memories assigned to each fracture, culminating at the statue’s heart. The ultimate "choice" is an endurance/renunciation: he commits fully to the ritual and to accepting loss rather than scrambling for survival. Physical danger recedes somewhat into the background during the long ritual, so the sense of narrowing options is more internal than external, but it remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether Elias will remain bound to grief or reconfigure his promise to Lena—is clear and consistent. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively: the mirror shatters his stasis, the pilgrimage risks his aging body, the literal fall forces him into the cave where an internal decision becomes unavoidable. His final action (leaving the shell) forecloses a long-held mode of mourning with visible emotional cost. The conflict stays largely internal and contemplative, so while it deepens, it never quite bites as sharply as it might.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to have his quiet, grief-forged belief tested and felt—is clear and culminates in Silas’s transformation. Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, with external pressure provided by Silas’s established shouting style and the recently broken heat wave. There is one main deepening turn when Silas appears and validates the whisper, but few intermediate tightenings or real risks of failure are dramatized. As a result, the stakes feel poignant but low-intensity, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can move through grief toward a livable forward journey—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates through the commitment to building the device and the risk of emotionally confronting the curated tableaus once the circuit is completed. However, the internal conflict is relatively smooth; there are few moments where she meaningfully hesitates or risks backsliding, so tightening feels more like steady deepening than hard trade-off. The cost (embracing loss without repair) is there, but sharper on-page friction at one or two beats would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—creating even a moment of psychological safety for Lena—is clear and emotionally weighted, and the checkpoint backstory hints at real danger. However, most on-page pressure is anticipatory; the present-time walk and harvesting proceed without active opposition or a sharp tightening beat. The escalation is largely internal (accepting possible failure yet proceeding), which works but limits visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Silas will respond to the stranger’s final gesture—is clear, but pressure remains soft throughout. The main tightening is his shift from curiosity to a sense of vocation, culminating in pressing the Edelweiss into the logbook and reclaiming his role as “keeper of silent stories.” There’s an emotional cost implicit in accepting the burden of others’ isolation, yet no moment really forecloses a competing option or forces a painful trade-off. The conflict is thus quietly effective but relatively static and low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—keeping a deathbed promise and risking himself in the flooding cavern—are clear and do tighten as the creek rises and the ants lead him through the only dry path. Escalation is present (storm building, water seeping, narrowing options) and coheres with his internal drive to trust intuition over skepticism. However, the resolution feels somewhat cushioned: once the chip is placed and understanding dawns, the danger abates almost immediately, minimizing on-page aftermath or cost. Internal conflict (doubt vs belief) is implied rather than dramatized in more fraught micro-choices, which keeps the pressure strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra will answer the warning in time to confront the source of the kingdom’s spiritual decay—is clear, and the climb functions as a meaningful test of her will. Internal and external conflicts are interwoven, but on-page pressure remains relatively gentle: the physical danger and the ticking-clock moon seldom feel actively constraining, and there’s little sense of options foreclosing beyond her initial decision to climb. The major tightening is the moment with the dripping starlight, which reframes the entire quest and forces her to confront her role in the wound. The resolution is earned but comparatively low-friction given the grand scale of the stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual/emotional—whether the moment between Kael and Lyra will be defined by shameful loss or shared presence—and that is clearly signaled and followed through. However, pressure on Elara is minimal; her method never feels at risk of failing, and there’s little sense of what she might lose by intervening or not. The key turn is essentially a guaranteed reframing rather than a contested outcome, so the escalation reads as steady deepening rather than tightening stakes. This keeps the piece affecting but somewhat low-tension, even by lyric standards.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can give shape to his terror and regain a livable relationship to time and mortality—is clear and threads the whole story. Pressure escalates from numb shock in the cabin to the more acute jealousy and self-confrontation in the dream, then resolves in a quieter but distinct stance shift at the end. The central tightening is the moment when the younger self waves; it breaks the corrosive jealousy and enables the later repricing of the grave. The main limitation is that the external mechanism of relief (the dream-written message) feels slightly convenient, softening the sense of hard-earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can restore the clamp, and by extension Mrs. Gable’s confidence and Elara’s own sense of usefulness—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates gently through the difficulty of working with tiny threads and impaired senses, but there is little sense that failure is a live possibility or that she must trade one value for another. Once she commits, the repair proceeds without misstep, reversal, or visible cost beyond concentrated effort. The resolution is earned and thematically apt, yet the conflict feels contemplative more than truly testing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can authentically “mend” her scars into narrative rather than erase or freeze them—is clear and tested when the ink begins to crystallize, threatening outright failure. Pressure escalates coherently with that visualized failure and her momentary tremor, then tightens around the necessity of confronting rather than suppressing her fear via the tear. Her choice to lean into the superstition and let herself feel the old terror functions as a credible, agency-driven resolution. What keeps the score mid-high rather than elite is that the story never quite sharpens secondary costs (e.g., professional consequences, magical danger) beyond the internal emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Valerius and delivering an overdue apology before the orchard and its tether are destroyed—is clearly established and maintained. Pressure escalates as the spirit manifests, the perfume is uncorked, and the music intensifies against the implicit ticking clock of the loggers’ arrival, culminating in the literal first axe blow. However, Elara encounters little active resistance; her plan works essentially as conceived, with no real risk of failure dramatized on the page. The emotional cost is present but not maximally sharpened into a hard trade-off or near-miss.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing cosmic illusions from ossifying into law—is signaled early and keeps tightening as the target words grow more fundamental, culminating in the void at “existence.” Escalation is structurally sound: each repaired definition increases pressure and narrows options, with the final test demanding a qualitatively different choice (refusal to define). Internal and external conflicts loosely braid, since her burden of memory underwrites her ability to resist illusion. Still, the personal cost and potential for failure could be made more viscerally felt during the “existence” beat to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—his need to understand what clocks truly measure—remains coherent and intensifies through the ritual as the sun halts, the regulator runs backward, and reality seems to flex under his experiment. The counting sequence provides a clear escalation pattern, with the world progressively deforming until “Two,” when understanding floods in. Still, the pressure is largely contemplative; there’s no serious risk that he will fail or suffer concrete loss beyond a more abstract spiritual cost, so tension is elegant rather than gripping. His final renunciation of the need to repeat the ritual resolves the conflict credibly but without a sharp on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconceive barriers (professional and emotional) as permeable without triggering “alarm”—is clear and coherently tied to her grief and the experiment. Pressure escalates modestly through Kael’s approach, his personal disclosures, and the mounting weight on the simple act of pressing the button. The decisive act of activating the beam registers as a genuine if quiet test of her new stance, with an emotional cost in allowing grief to move through her. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative and low-friction, with little visible resistance or risk of failure beyond internal discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform inherited probabilistic detachment into a compassionate, responsible perspective—is clear from early on. There is a meaningful tightening at the handless clock: using the lantern to reveal the door externalizes her internal contradiction and creates a turning point. However, conflict remains largely unopposed; nothing significant pushes back against her desire except her own prior framework, and even that yields fairly smoothly. The emotional cost is present but muted, so tension reads as gentle deepening rather than sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the caller remains trapped in his grief loop or can risk a new beginning—is clear and focused. Pressure tightens effectively when he articulates the loop (“Eighteen months… a circle with no exit”) and she counters with the musical disc metaphor, forcing a reframing choice. His decision to let this call be the pause and to redirect his dialing toward remembrance sites is a credible internal turn. However, the speed and smoothness of his acceptance make the struggle feel slightly under-contested for truly top-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict—whether she will remain anchored in sorrow or reconfigure her relationship to memory—is clear and coherently pressured by the ritual itself. Escalation tracks through concrete steps (lighting the lamp, steeping the lavender, inscribing covenant/breach/regeneration) that narrow her emotional options toward a decisive stance. However, opposition remains largely internal and fairly gentle; there’s little sense that she might fail or choose differently once the ritual begins. The stakes are intimate and resonant but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—Elara’s search for a cure to loneliness versus the risk of genuine connection—is signaled early and tightens when another equally lonely seeker arrives. The decisive turn is her relinquishing the stone and her old mission in favor of becoming a catalyst of connection from this place. Costs are primarily internal (surrendering mobility as identity, giving up the talisman), so the escalation feels emotionally real but gently scaled. Because external pressures remain minimal and there’s no serious possibility she’ll refuse the meeting once set up, the conflict never feels truly precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she navigate her grief to find the stillpoint of peace—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the forest’s accumulated vibrations drop into absolute silence. However, the path to that point is almost frictionless: the ring guides her smoothly, the notes cohere without missteps, and there’s no real risk of failure or reversal. The resolution feels earned texturally, but the story never forces a hard trade-off or tests her commitment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core conflict—whether Elara remains trapped in paralyzing shame or transforms her failure into useful caution—tightens through the decision to unbend the pen and act. The story’s main escalation is conceptual: from solitary blame to recognizing contingent causes and then choosing a new form of responsibility by sending “Doubt is data. Verify. Honor the web.” The cost—that she cannot and does not attempt to undo the fleet’s tragedy—is clear, but the pressure never quite sharpens into a dilemma with competing live options on the page. As a result, tension feels more meditative than urgent, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s isolation vs. the possibility of renewed connection grounded in his grief for Anya—is clear and tightened by Lily’s sudden presence. Pressure rises when his private ritual is witnessed for the first time in ten years, forcing a choice between continued solitude and engagement. That said, his internal struggle is underplayed; he accepts connection quickly, so tension never bites as hard as it could. The ending’s decision to return is poignant but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—fulfilling Elara’s promise and potentially healing the valley—are signaled early and clearly intertwined with Kael’s need for redemption. Pressure deepens as the art trail grows more thematically pointed and culminates at the vandalized self-portrait, which forces a new interpretive move (reading scars as music). Yet escalation is relatively smooth and unthreatened: there are no serious near-failures, time pressure, or genuine alternative paths considered, so options never feel sharply narrowed. The internal conflict largely resolves without a hard trade-off, muting the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—can Kael resurrect and sustain the shared entangled dream—is clear from early on and sharpened through his methodical drumming. Pressure escalates as the garden awakens and the dream-figures briefly solidify, then reverses when the universe “exhales” and strips them away. The cost is emotional and ongoing rather than a discrete irreversible choice, but his decision to persist despite repeated loss reads as an earned, high-stakes endurance. A more concrete external risk or direct institutional pressure on the page could have deepened the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—saving a disoriented inspector and proving the power of subtlety—are clear and coherent, and Kael’s choice to whisper via the gallery rather than chase the shouts is a genuine tactical turn. Pressure escalates from distant shouting and disorientation to the focused experiment at Junction Gamma. However, the sense of jeopardy is muted: Vale has been shouting for “twenty minutes,” yet no specific danger (injury, storm risk, time limit) is dramatized, so success feels almost guaranteed once Kael acts. The cost is thus more philosophical than visceral, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains trapped in her despair or can reorient toward hope—is legible and present early. Pressure accumulates via stillness and image rather than overt reversals, and Kael’s choice to escalate from mirror to full shutter choreography is a credible deepening. However, Elara never seems close to an opposing choice once his intervention begins; there’s little sense she might reject or fail to respond to his “lesson.” As a result, escalation feels modest and the price of her shift remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can a quiet, aesthetic intervention shift a rigid town’s mental habits—is clear and coherently pursued. Escalation is gentle but present: from private coaching to collective planning to town-wide displays and observed reactions. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly abstract; there’s no on-page resistance beyond implied skepticism, so the sense of risk and potential loss remains low. The resolution is earned but somewhat frictionless, with Elias never seriously tested or forced into a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can truly relinquish violence and self-condemnation to find inner freedom—is clear, and the ritual dive is a meaningful turn. Internal and external conflict align as she releases memories and the cutlass, paying an emotional price. Yet pressure escalates only gently; there’s little sense that she might fail or that her resolve might crack, and no significant reversal or tightening beyond the whale call initiating the process. As a result, the climax reads more as an inevitable unfolding than a hard-won test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can inhabit grief without mask or mandate—is clear and threads the whole piece. Escalation is quiet but present: the shift from theatrical narration to softer prayer, the splinter and blood as a small but concrete cost, and the morally ambiguous use of Elara’s bouquet all deepen the pressure on his coping strategy. The final act of placing the sparrow in the bouquet and allowing the tear is a credible earned-stasis choice that forecloses his old performance-for-others mode. That said, the middle does not markedly tighten options beyond deepening reflection, so pressure feels more steadily layered than sharply ratcheted.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stated stakes—challenging a long-standing sacred ban and reconfiguring a landscape’s order—are conceptually high, but the on-page pressure is soft. Once the poet begins paraphrasing, each line works predictably; there is no serious threat of failure, backlash, or ethical friction that might test their resolve. Escalation is primarily in imagery (hum deepens, glyphs shimmer, spaces clear) rather than in genuinely narrowing options or heightening cost. As a result, the piece reads as a beautiful ritual more than a true conflict with hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are intimate and primarily internal: whether Kael can reconceive his ruined work and whether Elara can unlock a new mode of perception. There is one clear tightening when the “failure” sphere becomes a site of revaluation and when he decides to test the reed. However, conflict is gentle; opposition (his shame, skepticism) melts quickly once she speaks, and there’s little sense that either might refuse the exchange or pay a sharper price. The piece reads as a graceful progression more than a pressurized test.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether sound will be treated as dead data or living connection—is legible early and clearly at odds with the lab’s doctrine. There is one meaningful tightening when Elara’s experiment initially seems to “fail” (flatlined sensors), after which she doubles down on her alternate mode of listening. However, conflict remains largely philosophical; there is little genuine jeopardy or loss if she fails, and institutional pushback is mild and quickly dissolved. As a result, escalation feels measured rather than urgent, and the “revolution” lands more as a graceful pivot than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can move from paralyzing grief into a renewed, outward-facing purpose—is clear early and coherently tightened. Pressure escalates through her ritual (third crane), the vulnerable act of parting the curtains, and the high-emotion revelation of the fungi nebula, culminating in the relinquishing of the stencil into the locket as a public beacon. The conflict is largely internal/psychic, with no antagonistic force beyond despair, but her micro-choices under that pressure (go up the hill, open the curtains, leave the locket) are legible and consequential. The main limit is a relative lack of sharp trade-offs or messy fallout; the turn is intense but smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake—Leo’s need for orientation and meaning after financial/ideological collapse—is clear but gently handled. Pressure rises a little when Elara chooses to move from tea and silence to confiding in her method, which unlocks Leo’s recognition of his own adaptive choices. However, there is minimal sense of risk, alternative paths, or cost to either character if the encounter fails; the talk proceeds smoothly without real friction. The result is affecting but more meditative than tense, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can purify nostalgia without being consumed and thereby alter her people’s fate—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the “core atom” of the civilization’s end of innocence. The escalation from individual memories to the collective, catastrophic choice of the elders deepens both emotional and conceptual pressure. Her agency directly shapes the resolution: she chooses to hold anguish and joy together and accept the forbidden knowledge with its cost. The conflict remains mostly internal and controlled, which slightly tempers visceral tension but fits the piece’s contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal: Elara’s fear of corruption and her allegiance to static hope versus the pressure of an evolving dream-ecosystem. Stakes are legible—misreading the shadow could jeopardize the integrity of humanity’s hopes—and escalate as she discovers its long, patient interaction with dreams. The key tightening comes when her investigation shows the shadow strengthening, not destroying, hopes, forcing her to choose between her old creed and a more complex one. The pressure remains relatively gentle and contemplative, so while it escalates, it never quite feels dangerous or irreversibly costly beyond the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can preserve her compassion without leaving her sanctuary vulnerable—is clear but remains almost entirely internal and uncontested on the page. The main “escalation” is structured as successive layers of introspective shedding, but each layer yields relatively easily, with little resistance or real risk of failure. External pressures (the trafficker, the possibility of future threats) are conceptual rather than dramatized, so options never feel sharply narrowed in scene. As a result, the resolution reads more like a well-argued self-dialogue than a hard-won choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s relationship to her own wounds and need for closure, signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates primarily via deepening insight as the plant telepathy exposes models of scarring and regrowth, culminating in her renunciation of old tactics. However, the internal conflict never feels truly precarious—there’s little sense that she might cling to her old mode or that a competing value could win—so the turn, while clear, feels more graceful than fraught. The lack of external or interpersonal friction keeps the stakes somewhat abstract despite the strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can locate/understand where unused love resides—is clear but largely internal and contemplative, with minimal escalation beyond deepening recognition. Her choosing to undergo the psychometry and to trust the film’s emotional residue is a meaningful commitment, but it isn’t significantly tested or complicated. The key tightening is the moment where Clara’s hidden love for the director is revealed and then reframed into the final thematic insight, yet this progression remains smooth rather than pressured. Stronger friction—doubt, misreading, or a potential mis-use of what she finds—would heighten stakes without betraying the quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—freeing her creativity from the prison of grief—is clearly signaled and remains coherent throughout. Pressure escalates via intensifying interior experience: each traced star draws deeper memories until she faces the realization that she herself has built the cage. The key turn is the move from striving to surrender, accepting rest as active rather than passive, which credibly resolves the conflict at this length. Still, the path is smooth and largely unresisted; there is little sense of genuine risk or potential failure beyond the internal reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—kindling light in a ravaged, post-forest world—is clear, but the piece reads as a near-inevitable ritual rather than a pressured test. There is a meaningful tightening when he enters the fully dark hollow and attempts to raise a spark, yet there’s no real possibility of failure or visible external resistance. The cost is conceptual and long-term (endless walking, dreamless service), not sharply dramatized in the central beat. As a result, tension feels meditative more than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the forest’s silenced heart and deepening his inner alignment—is clear, but pressure stays gentle and largely uncontested. Once he finds the gear and the matching socket, there is no genuine alternative, risk, or moral tension; inserting it is obvious and unopposed. References to prior anxiety and fear are retrospective, so the on-page journey contains minimal escalation beyond wonder. The ending offers resolution without a sharp sense of cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will access and own her “unused courage”—is signaled early and answered at the end, but escalation is deliberately soft. The main tightening is the accumulation of ticket stars and the approach to the ridgeway’s heart, plus her momentary chest-tightening on the steep ascent. Because the guides gently manage the journey and there is no strong counter-force, the sense of risk or trade-off stays muted. The story succeeds as a meditative, low-conflict piece, but under a demanding lens the pressure feels limited.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will perpetuate deadly silence or break it at personal/moral cost—is clear and sharpened by the discovery of the hidden chamber and the bolt. Pressure escalates from background guilt to a concrete test: ignore the anomaly, close the door, or document and memorialize, with her choice visibly foreclosing the path of self-protective denial. The interplay of internal ethics and institutional norms is strong, though all conflict remains interior, with no on-page counterforce pushing back once she decides. As a result, escalation feels deep rather than sharp, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring truth by unmasking Valerius—is clear and consistent, and there is a conceptual tightening from private vigil to public exposure. But on-page conflict is largely static: Kael faces no new opposition, temptations, or tactical trade-offs across his “pause of shifting constellations,” and Elara’s risk is compressed into a single summarized scene. The sunder moment is powerful but arrives without much sense that failure was ever a live possibility. As a result, the story feels more like a beautifully described foregone conclusion than a pressured struggle with visible reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains a passive mourner or claims an active, memory-keeping role—is clear and culminates in her deliberate choice to continue tapping as archive. Pressure escalates when her ritual, previously a coping mechanism, suddenly becomes a biometric key with world-revealing consequences, forcing her to reinterpret her own past actions. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little sense of alternative paths or genuine risk to her stance beyond continued numbness. The shift is satisfying but relatively gentle, lacking a sharp on-page trade-off or external constraint that would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant conflict—how to respond to the rebellion’s suffocating lull—is clear and present from the outset, and the stone-circle ritual provides a focused pressure point. Escalation works on an internal/accumulative axis: the hum intensifies, memories surface, and his understanding of the lull and of rebellion deepens to a new commitment. The cost is subtle but legible: he relinquishes fantasies of immediate action and embraces a slower, inner form of resistance. The piece stops short of any external test or real trade-off in the present scene, which keeps pressure solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will submit to inherited strictures or act decisively for the land’s urgent recovery—is clear and paid off through her choice to unseal the amber herself. Pressure escalates once she recognizes the prophecy’s demand for an “innocent child” and consciously rejects waiting, narrowing her options and committing her to a path she cannot reverse. However, obstacles remain mostly conceptual; there is no strong counterforce or on-page consequence beyond internal and symbolic risk, which softens the sense of genuine peril. The result is thoughtfully tense but not quite bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can inhabit the present without being re-traumatized—is clear, and the gull-trigger freeze to self-initiated freeze-as-reverence is a meaningful internal shift. However, pressure feels relatively static; there is little sense that she might genuinely fail or backslide within this scene. The somatic techniques work on the first try, and no on-page choice threatens to undo her hard-won equilibrium. As a result, escalation is more a deepening of reflection than a tightening of stakes, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can repair a fracturing reality and reclaim authentic art—stays coherent, and pressure escalates from flickering shelves and groaning walls to the dense, knotted web and the “obsidian-dark” final knot. His agency drives the key turns: choosing to descend, to face his own shame-thread, and to accept the lighthouse/ocean paradox. However, the conflict remains relatively frictionless; once he commits, the world yields to his compassionate skill with little resistance or risk of failure. The cost is largely internal and conceptual, which works but keeps tension at a thoughtful simmer rather than a boil.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the time distortion—is clear and present from early on, and the spill → pattern → drone disappearance is a genuine escalation of both mystery and cost. Still, the conflict remains primarily intellectual and contemplative; there’s no strong counter-want or external pressure testing his drive, so tension stays relatively low-key. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path, but the price reads more elegiac than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose a foundational lie and risk destabilization versus preserve oppressive stability—is clear and on-page. Pressure tightens effectively with the sudden approach of Kael, forcing her to crystallize her stance “within the blink that follows surprise” before cover-up is impossible. The ethical calculus is legible and the choice forecloses a safer path, but we don’t see any immediate repercussion, only the implied future scandal, which keeps the cost conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Still, internal and external conflicts are well braided and escalate once in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to live by nonviolence and transform her father’s legacy—is clear, but it’s signaled as already decided and never truly challenged. The primary on-page “turn” is the daily ritual of drawing and re-sheathing the knife, which functions more as reaffirmation than escalation. No new tension or external pressure arises to narrow her options or force a trade-off beyond what we’re told she’s long been doing. As a result, the conflict feels thematically rich but dramatically low-pressure for this market tier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reaching and integrating the goddess’s echo—is clear and external danger (shattering chords, vortices, cacophony) interlocks well with Elara’s internal grief. Escalation is evident in the mounting chaos, the wall of cacophony, and the final confrontation with the silent vortex, each requiring an escalated use of her method and emotional exposure. The resolution is clearly driven by her choice to channel grief and voice a “most perfect silence,” which forecloses the simpler “capture” desire. The piece softens jeopardy slightly—Elara rarely feels in real danger of failure—so tension stays high but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Alistair’s death was an accident and how Elara will respond if it was not—is clear and present early. There is one solid deepening when the investigation shifts from impersonal evidence (shutter, weather) to the intimate clue of the bent nib and journal, tightening the emotional pressure. However, the investigation proceeds almost frictionlessly, with no real false leads, counter-pressure, or resistance beyond Elara’s own mild regret; the choice to publish is treated as obviously correct and largely unopposed. This keeps tension from fully peaking and makes the conflict feel more like an elegant puzzle than a hard-won moral decision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can answer and thereby transform the haunting cry that embodies her guilt—is clear and present from early on. Pressure does deepen meaningfully when she recognizes the exact emotional signature of her niece’s cry, forcing her to confront a specific past failure. However, the path from realization to resolution is relatively unopposed: once she knows what to do, nothing resists her attempt, so the escalation curve is more contemplative than tense. The cost is internal and credible, but the conflict never quite feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform chaotic release into meaningful, integrated understanding—is established early and deepened by the shard’s whisper and the increasingly organized mandala. Pressure coheres around the emergent hush being threatened by the anxious “What remains?” and her choice to interject “Integrate” is a clear, agency-driven tightening that reweights the entire ritual. However, the escalation is gentle; there’s little sense that failure would have a significant cost beyond temporary discomfort, so the conflict feels refined rather than truly fraught. Still, for a lyric piece, the single decisive deepening is well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the plaza remains a tomb of frozen pain or is reclaimed as a sanctuary—is legible early and resolved by Elara’s choice to rename. Internal pressure builds from retrocognitive entrapment to the moment of inscription and embedding the tessera, which dissolves the trap and reweights the space. However, antagonistic forces (elders’ resistance, communal fear) are kept off-page and in summary, so escalation reads as a deepening of resolve rather than a tightening of real options under fire. The cost is mostly internal and ethical rather than dramatically tested, keeping conflict effective but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can rescue and honor the unrealized duet’s “possibility” enough to let herself go—is legible from early on and tightens as the echoes coalesce and Julian appears. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial: the weaving of more echoes and intensifying temporal responses deepen pressure until she must choose between clinging and acceptance. The cost of her final renunciation (dissolving into morning light, leaving the coin behind) is clear and felt. The lack of overt resistance or complication slightly flattens the pressure curve, keeping it in the strong rather than exquisite band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Maya’s need for connection and Elara’s need to reconcile skepticism with empathy—are clear and present early. Pressure increases modestly as Elara chooses to surrender to somatic markers and let them dictate her artistic process, risking her rational comfort to serve Maya’s grief. However, there is little sense that she might refuse or fail; the conflict is more contemplative than fraught, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent. The cost is present but subtle, residing mainly in Elara’s willingness to let go of explanatory control.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving a felt map so humanity wakes connected rather than alienated—is clear and meaningful, and the fossil’s levitation is a genuine intensification. However, opposition and trade-offs are mostly implicit; Elara does not face a live alternative or significant sacrifice in the moment, and nothing resists her goal besides solitude and scale. The piece works more as a revelation-driven deepening than as escalating conflict with visible, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the prophesied collapse remains fate or becomes a collectively-altered future—is clear and present from early on. Escalation comes via the physical manifestation of danger (crack in the ceiling) and the interpretive breakthrough that the black sand marks attention, not doom. However, opposition is mostly notional; there is no on-page resistance to her plan, and the emotional or practical price of acting is lightly sketched. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent but feels relatively low-friction for the magnitude of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk genuine vulnerability and relational repair after betrayal—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is subtle but real: he moves from private ritual (snow-code, silent apology) to the external test of Anya’s appearance, culminating in the decision to open and relinquish the pillbox. The cost is emotional rather than situationally extreme, but the narrative makes that cost clear by foregrounding his burnt past and his cage of caution. The conflict could feel slightly low-variance for some elite markets, yet within a quiet, lyric frame it tightens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas has broken or fulfilled his promise—is signaled early and deepens as memories of the mine, Elara’s decline, and his daughter’s upbringing accumulate. Pressure escalates texturally: the ticking gutters, layered palimpsest metaphor, and fog-thinning converge on a single internal turn where he redefines fulfillment. His agency lies in endurance and reinterpretation rather than overt action, culminating in the decision to “write no more over the promise; he would live its essence.” The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so tension is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether understanding can be gained about why this place resists change—remains mostly internal and contemplative, with little opposition beyond time running out with the sun. Escalation exists in the deepening from simple curiosity to a multi-layered vision that reframes time and kindness, but it’s gentle rather than pressured. His agency is real (choosing to engage the ritual and then to reinterpret his craft), yet he never faces a hard trade-off or foreclosed option on the page. The conflict is coherent but low-intensity, which limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether her small act of reflected light can matter against surrounding darkness—is clear and coherently pursued, with the meaningful tightening coming when Mateo notices, validating and raising the emotional stakes of the ritual. Escalation is subtle but present: from private preparation, to active casting, to being seen, to the quiet acceptance of ongoing cyclical effort. However, the pressure never feels truly contested—there is little sense of risk beyond vulnerability and fatigue, so the cost reads gentle rather than sharp. The resolution is appropriately quiet earned endurance, but could gain from a touch more friction or threat to her practice or belief.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will be consumed by Kaelen’s memories or learn to coexist with them—is clearly signaled and resolved. Pressure escalates via the ritual: she intentionally deepens the brittle awakening, risking further dissolution of self to gain clarity. However, external or relational counter-pressure is minimal, and obstacles are mostly internalized, so the path to resolution feels relatively smooth and safe. The cost (embracing a solitude refigured as stewardship) is legible but could be sharpened with a more concrete sacrifice or harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to move from isolated keeper of others’ secrets to personally connected participant—is clear but lightly pressured. The main turn (choosing to create the installation) faces no external resistance or serious internal doubt, and subsequent beats (people contributing, her final offering) unfold smoothly. Tension is primarily conceptual and atmospheric rather than dramatized through hard trade-offs or foreclosed options. As a result, escalation feels more like steady deepening of a mood than a tightening that forces difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—community cohesion vs. manipulative cosmic discord, with Aris’s career as secondary—is clear early and tightens toward the timed pulsar alignment and Croft’s ultimatum. Escalation is mostly linear but effective: memo raises cost, midnight window narrows options, and the live broadcast cannot be undone. The main weakness is the lack of on-page active resistance from the tricksters or Croft during the act itself, which softens the sense of struggle at the peak. Still, Aris’s choice to proceed in the face of likely firing gives the ending real, if modestly scaled, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stakes—her village’s survival and her own psychological limit—are clear and interwoven, and the key tightening is her decision to climb into the confining loft rather than retreat. The organ-playing sequence is a strong agency-driven turn that resolves both spatial danger and the quest. However, the conflict path is fairly frictionless once she recalls the journal; each move works on the first try, so the pressure never quite peaks. The cost is mostly psychological rather than situational, which suits the piece but keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can recover a truthful, humane portrait of Clara—is clear, and tension builds steadily from uncertain search to discovery to the emotionally risky act of reading and internalizing the journal. The key tightening is the move from searching blind along the quarry edge to finding the carved mask and hidden niche, which both escalates and narrows possibilities. However, opposition is mostly situational and internal, with little real resistance or risk of failure beyond emotional cost, so pressure remains relatively gentle. The final stance shift is earned, but the journey there lacks a sharper test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stakes—saving lives and redeeming Aris’s name—are clearly signaled and converge under time pressure once the anomalous pattern matches the journal’s warning. Escalation is coherent and reasonably taut, with the key tightening at the moment she decodes the hidden coordinates and realizes the current threat. Elara’s choice to confront and refuse complacency is the central act of agency and it drives the evacuation. However, resistance is modest (the technician verifies once, then fully commits), so the external conflict resolves a bit smoothly for elite-level intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains trapped in elegiac grief or reclaims a generative relationship to his music—is clear, and his choice to play again with the glass flake on the strings is a meaningful, agency-driven turn. Pressure, however, escalates only gently; once the magical elements appear, there is little resistance or risk of backsliding dramatized on the page. The story tells us this shift is hard-won (“ashes of ‘never’”), but his internal struggle during the scene feels comparatively low-friction. As a result, tension is present but not especially taut.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant conflict—how to relate to ambition and legacy without repeating destructive territorial hunger—is clear and threads through Leo’s backstory, the markers, and the talk with Kai. Pressure escalates mildly when Kai arrives with his “True North” pitch, forcing Leo to articulate what he’s learned and choose how to respond. However, Leo never seems truly tempted or internally torn; his stance is stable, so the stakes feel largely intellectual rather than viscerally risky. The final choice to leave the money is meaningful but comes without a strongly felt trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—solitary, unsustainable vigilance versus the possibility of shared burden—is well established and escalates from weariness to crisis of meaning. The telegram functions as a genuine tightening/deepening beat that forces a stance change rather than a mere comfort. However, the emotional and practical price of her previous stance (what she risks in relinquishing it, or what damage it’s done) could be dramatized more viscerally. The resolution is earned but slightly too serene, with limited sense of ongoing tension or sacrifice beyond the insight itself.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—confronting a buried shame to break the curse—is clear early and escalates as the ritual’s circles progress from breath to sound to memory to intention. The key tightening arrives when the frozen confession is revealed to be her own cowardice, forcing her to choose between continued self-protection and costly self-acceptance. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, with the lake’s state tracking her willingness to unbend. However, the external opposition offers little genuine resistance (the ritual proceeds smoothly once begun), so escalation feels more like an elegant unfolding than a truly pressured test.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara can find and mend the intersection of dreams—is clear and present from early on, and pressure does build as she follows a glowing path into increasingly charged space. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to heed the scars, endure pain, and ultimately pour her history into the rift. However, there is minimal active resistance or risk of failure; once the method is invoked, events progress smoothly to success without a complicating turn or meaningful loss beyond discomfort. This keeps the tension from reaching truly gripping levels despite solid coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can successfully trade his hope for Elara’s peace and bear the cost—is clear and present from early on. There is a discernible tightening when the wisp appears and he offers himself as a “willing vessel,” culminating in the silver fire and the flooding sorrow. Still, the pressure arc is relatively gentle; there’s no real moment where he hesitates, fails, or risks backing out, so tension stays more contemplative than agonized. The conflict remains largely internal and devotional, with limited escalation beyond intensity of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—how Leo will live with public failure and find purpose—is signaled early and tightened when his usual coping method (facts) fails, forcing him into the more painful emotional terrain of memory. The internal conflict between seeking validation and wanting authentic, unseen service escalates credibly, culminating in the renunciation of his current career path. The cost is emotional and vocational rather than externalized, but it’s legible: he gives up a status-granting profession for a quieter, uncertain one. The conflict remains largely static in external terms, yet the deepening of his stance under pressure is sufficient for this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—an obsessive need to empirically capture transition versus the human need to grieve and accept—is clear and focused. Pressure escalates credibly from another failed experiment to the brink of despair, then tightens around the decision to plant the seed instead of persisting in the same measuring tactics. The cost is the surrender of his controlling, instrument-driven approach in favor of a more vulnerable, relational stance. The internal push-pull could be dramatized with slightly sharper on-page resistance before the pivot, but the arc still reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—keeping wonder alive in a world atemporalized (“after tomorrow had disappeared”)—is conceptually strong and signaled early. Pressure modestly deepens as she confronts sharper contradictions (“I am forgotten” vs. “I am remembered”) and pays an emotional price (the tear of awe). Yet escalation is minimal: no option is meaningfully foreclosed, and there’s no moment where her commitment is at risk, so tension remains contemplative rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will cling to his private burden of grief or risk dissolving his isolation—is clear early and narrows credibly to the heartbeat-long choice about the pearl. Escalation is primarily internal: reading confessions that mirror his own failures intensifies pressure and forces a trade-off between safety and connection. The cost is felt (relinquishing the pearl, reorienting his life’s purpose), though the conflict stays contemplative and never feels truly knife-edge perilous. Still, for this length and mode, the single decisive tightening is effective and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can begin to forgive herself—is signaled early and stays coherent. Escalation is internal: crossing the threshold, confronting graffiti, then testing the patched accordion are progressively more vulnerable acts that narrow her options from abstract rumination to embodied choice. The cost is subtle but legible in relinquishing the map and accepting an imperfect, ongoing process. The conflict never becomes static, but the pressure remains low-key and entirely interior, which keeps it just below top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain a detached chronicler or risk voicing her own unspoken words—is clear and does tighten as the library “answers” her engagement. Escalation is subtle and internal: from decoding an external mystery to exposing personal vulnerability, with the incoming letter and dawn functioning as a soft time pressure. The meaningful turn is her choice to write and then speak her long-held apology, foreclosing continued safe detachment. However, the threat or cost of not changing remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, which slightly blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—propagating the extinct mulberry versus preserving the violin as an imperial trophy—is explicit and consistent, with the coffee-stain futures tightening the conflict into a stark, mutually exclusive fork. Escalation is clear under a causal lens: the prophetic images remove any illusory middle ground and force a sacrificial decision, culminating in the drawn bow and irreversible shattering. The moral cost and emotional stakes (legacy, conquest, grief) are felt on the page. External antagonism (the Grand Archive) is conceptually strong but physically absent, so the conflict leans heavily internal and could feel sharper with even one concrete external impediment in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion—is declared early and clearly tied to the ritual. Pressure does rise somewhat as Elara waits for the exact threshold, with cues like Kael’s cooling skin and the aurora’s stillness signaling a single crucial moment. Yet there is minimal sense of risk, resistance, or possible failure; her mastery and the scene’s serenity undercut tension. The ending reads as an assured completion rather than a hard-won, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—releasing the last shards of resentment to reach contentment—is legible but experiences little true tightening; she is already inclined to forgive before the scene begins. Climbing the tree and the carving ritual represent steps, but they don’t introduce new resistance, risk, or narrowed options. The choice to forgive as “self-care” is clear yet largely unchallenged, so tension stays low and smooth. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative rather than pressured, capping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael remains imprisoned in absolute self-blame or re-enters a more complex humanity—is signaled early and tightens toward the concrete test of removing the cloak and releasing the shard. Elara’s gentle pressure, the evolving chime responses, and Kael’s trembling decision create a single, meaningful escalation. The main limit is that conflict remains relatively low-friction and interior; a sharper moment of near-refusal could heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Aris will integrate his personal grief into his teachings—is clear but largely internal and reflective. Pressure does deepen as the rings’ patterns and the sycamore-spiral converge, pushing him toward the realization that his work is about love and translation, and he makes a choice to continue withholding his deepest grief. However, escalation is gentle; no option is sharply foreclosed on the page, and there’s little sense of real risk that he might choose otherwise in the moment. The conflict functions, but for elite venues it reads more as elegant meditation than genuinely tightening dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Corbin can unify and “appraise” the fractured Pulse without moving or violating his reverent code—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-friction. There is one meaningful deepening when the flock splits, revealing the Pulse’s bifurcation and forcing Corbin to reconceive navigation as integration. However, there is little sense of real jeopardy, competing goods, or possible failure; once the birds appear, events unfold almost ceremonially. The result is a beautiful but relatively unpressured escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will submit to the guild’s definition of value or hold to her own—is clear and threads the piece. There is a meaningful tightening at the keystone: the implied expectation is retrieval, and she instead chooses to leave it and later to invest care in the seed, foreclosing easy guild approval. However, the external component of the quest poses little resistance; the ascent is wondrous rather than threatening, so tension remains mostly philosophical and emotional. This keeps the conflict compelling but relatively low-pressure, more meditative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will cling to defensive objectivity or risk re-engaging with his grief and belief in luminous vows—is signaled early and paid off. Pressure escalates through his descent, the discovery of the chest, and the emotionally destabilizing content of the logbook, culminating in the choice to weep, reinterpret Elara’s sounds as colors, and leave the key. The cost is his relinquishment of the “fortress of objectivity” and of the talismanic key, which reads as a real relinquishing of a long-held obsessional defense. However, the conflict never faces much external resistance, so the sense of narrowing options and risk is mostly internal and stays relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her vigil has meaning in a closed universe—is clear, and the static worsening into “violent bursts” provides some escalation. The key tightening comes when she actively casts the coins with the explicit question “Does my vigil serve the continuum of memory?”, forcing her to confront doubt and interpret the response. However, the opposition remains largely internal and metaphysical, with no real threat to her role or any alternative path that might be taken, so the sense of cost and narrowing options is muted. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-pressure conflict curve.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can transmute his paralyzing grief into purposeful naming of fear—is clearly signaled and escalates as he moves from lesser monsters to the core terror of the Void of Unmourned Goodbyes. Each naming raises the emotional cost and forces him to pour in more personal material (regret, futile love, then unspoken goodbye). However, the conflict remains largely internal and unopposed; there’s no real sense of potential failure, backlash, or alternative choice beyond emotional difficulty. As a result, tension does deepen, but the pressure curve feels smooth rather than sharply tightening around a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance so the sea can live again—is signaled early and threads cleanly through the scene, with one clear tightening as the bell begins to hum and the sea responds. Elara’s agency is strong in the preparatory and endurance choices; she chooses attention and patience over force, and that choice directly drives the outcome. However, antagonistic pressure is minimal and success feels almost inevitable once the process begins; the story could benefit from one concrete threat, failure mode, or cost that more sharply tests her brittle devotion on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—Elara’s ethical stance against bureaucratic erasure—is clear, and the encounter with the bottle intensifies that pressure into a concrete choice. The internal stakes (relationship to her past, how history is treated) are well-defined and reweighted by the end. However, external pressure is low: institutional consequences and physical danger remain hypothetical, so escalation feels more contemplative than truly pressured. The result is a rich but relatively gentle arc rather than a sharply tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—whether to obey the grimoire’s harsh prescription of flame or trust her recoiling intuition—is clear and thematically aligned. There is a meaningful tightening when she recognizes the cost (“success meant unity and failure, irreversible fracture”) and when the grimoire and her intuition are in direct opposition. However, once the murmuration appears, the path to solution unfolds smoothly without a serious setback or a moment where failure feels plausibly imminent. As a result, tension is steady rather than escalating sharply, and the resolution feels graceful more than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—maintaining trustworthy reports under pressure—is legible, and the key tightening is her recognition that the initial log is “tainted,” forcing a revision choice. Internal and external pressures interweave (past failure vs present duty), and the act of revising as covenant is a meaningful stance crystallization. However, tension is relatively low; solutions arrive without much contestation or risk beyond emotional cost. The escalation is sufficient for a quiet piece but not especially sharp or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Kaela’s battle with numbness—is clear, and the decision to treat numbness as canvas rather than enemy forms the main tightening. Yet once that stance is articulated, opposition largely evaporates; the vivification proceeds without friction, complication, or serious risk of failure. The galactic custody conflict is entirely off-stage and then simply rendered irrelevant, so external stakes never truly bite. As a result, escalation feels modest and the victory comes with less on-page struggle than the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—Elias’s relationship to slow, process-centered innovation versus external pressures for immediacy—is present but remains largely internal and unopposed on the page. Planting the seed is an act of faith, yet it comes with minimal on-scene resistance or trade-off; investor conflict is remembered rather than dramatized. The main tightening is his decision to resurrect “The Patient Bloom,” which deepens his commitment but doesn’t feel dangerous or costly in the moment. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative more than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how grief can be transmuted into bearable memory—is legible and present early. Escalation comes through the intensifying ritual, the engine’s roar, and the surprising emergence of crystalline laughter, which reweights what’s at risk emotionally. The cost is mostly internal and ongoing (he cannot bring Clara back, only haunt the house with altered joy), but it reads clearly as a chosen endurance. Conflict is more atmospheric than combative, yet it maintains coherent pressure and yields an earned stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant conflict—return home versus honoring the vigil and friendship with the garden—is sharply defined and culminates in a clear trade-off. The portal appearance is a strong escalation and the guardian’s refusal forecloses a deeply desired path, with the ache of homesickness persisting as an on-page price. Conflict is intensely internal and largely contemplative, but the stakes are consistently framed and the peak decision feels earned rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—Elara versus a stifling destiny of servitude and the apparent irreparability of the crozier—is clear and escalates from procedural failure to existential despair to conceptual breakthrough. The turning point (“creative destruction”) genuinely changes her options and tactics. That said, once the insight lands, the external resistance feels minimal; the transformation proceeds almost too smoothly, reducing perceived risk. The emotional stakes are substantial but could benefit from a sharper sense of what renewed failure or outright rejection would cost her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—realizing the universe’s “first breath” hidden in endings—is clear, but the on-page pressure is more meditative than constricting. The primary tightening is her deliberate renunciation of layered expectations (loudness, language, validation), which does deepen the internal conflict but never truly threatens real loss beyond pride and habit. There is little sense that she could fail tonight or pay a serious price; the transition from pursuit to realization is relatively frictionless. As a result, escalation feels thematically rich but dramatically modest.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the passengers and merging fractured timelines—is clear and signaled early, and the move into the grotto is a solid escalation. However, the conflict feels under-pressured: Leo never encounters a real setback or moral trade-off, and his first intuitive attempt at tuning the harmonic frequency succeeds. There’s little sense of narrowing options or a price he might pay if he fails, beyond the abstract threat, which blunts tension. The result is a graceful arc without much bite.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how far Elara can rationally manipulate connection without violating its nature—is established early and sharpened by the risk of memories altering “beyond gentle influence.” Pressure escalates credibly through the thread’s resistance and the perceptual rupture that strips her of control. The cost is emotional and ethical rather than physical: she faces the painful immersion into others’ raw memories and relinquishes her controlling stance. The conflict remains largely philosophical and internal, so while the turn is meaningful, the sense of hard trade-off or irrecoverable loss is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central pressure is largely intellectual and spiritual—whether these students can meaningfully expand their perception beyond the ocean to the stars. The only overt conflict is Lyra’s voiced skepticism, which is resolved quickly and gently once the holotank demonstration works. There’s a modest escalation from abstract explanation to experiential understanding, but almost no sense of risk, potential failure, or genuine opposition. As a result, stakes feel lofty in concept but soft in scene, and tension remains low-key throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—whether Arthur’s final message reaches Lily before it “dissolves into silence”—is emotionally legible but faces no substantial opposition. Elara’s method works on the first attempt; the “sacred tension of the hour when the dead call” never manifests as an active constraint or deadline in her process. The arrival of Lily and the social worker resolves the situation smoothly, without a meaningful narrowing of options or visible trade-off. As a result, escalation feels suggested by language rather than enacted in concrete turns.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stakes—honoring an erased legacy versus physical/psychic danger—are clear from the outset and tighten via claustrophobia and the looming tide. There is one strong escalation when the Array activates and then again when water begins seeping in, forcing him to choose between lingering in the sanctified space and survival. Internal and external pressures interweave well, with his fear of enclosed spaces sharpening the risk of drowning. However, conflict resolves relatively cleanly once he decides to run; tactics don’t significantly shift beyond “escape now,” so the escalation is effective but not especially complex.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are largely internal and conceptual—recovering herself from erasure and reconfiguring systemic compassion—signaled early and honored through to the end. Pressure escalates in a gentle, accumulative way as the ink patterns reveal the human error and she chooses interpretation over accusation. What’s missing, at this elite standard, is a sharper sense that something might be lost or foreclosed tonight if she fails; the conflict feels spiritually urgent but practically safe. The emotional turn is nonetheless clear when she reorients from seeking culprits to codifying safeguards for others.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the dying language by translating the diamond’s texture—is clear, and the accumulative pressure of matching textures, birds, and sounds builds toward a single culminating word. However, the conflict is largely one-sided ritual; the curse never manifests, there are no failed attempts, and the sky-dancer patterning proceeds without meaningful complication. Internal fear or doubt rarely spikes to provide substitute pressure. As a result, escalation is present but gentle, with little sense of a path truly being foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Aris’s choice between exposing a cryptid for professional redemption or protecting an untamed harmony—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates as the static ritual begins and the garden responds, culminating in an irreversible metamorphosis that forces Aris’s stance. The decisive turn is her choice to abandon her mission and align with Elara and Lyra, with a believable internal cost. Some beats lean more toward awe than sharpened dilemma, slightly softening felt tension in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs mechanical control—is clearly signaled early and escalates from failed past attempts to a last, high-stakes effort. The micro-turn from music as insufficient to the physical act of uprooting the vines provides a meaningful tightening, and her fingers tearing on the thorns offers a concrete price. However, antagonistic pressure is somewhat soft; the statues register but don’t truly endanger or constrain her beyond mood, and the monolith yields quickly once she commits. As a result, tension is present and coherent but never feels as precarious or contested as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a clandestine circuit of care under active surveillance—is clear and sharpened by the patrol drone’s sudden proximity. There is one solid escalation when Kael chooses to deploy the thunderstorm, which is legibly risky and alters options by forcing temporary secrecy. Beyond that, tension remains mostly atmospheric rather than escalating through visible trade-offs or near-failures. The story could feel more gripping if one tactic visibly faltered or exacted a concrete loss before the ending’s quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue living in sealed silence or risk vocalizing and engaging with renewal—is legible and tightens as she moves from cautious observation to physical contact with the horse to the memory of Lily and the decision to sing. The singing and halo completion constitute a meaningful deepening with emotional cost and clear before/after stakes. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat frictionless; she encounters little genuine resistance or backsliding in the climax, which slightly softens the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to discover where stories truly live—is clear, but the pressure around it is gentle and mostly internal. The main “tightening” is the shift from abstract quest to concrete ritual leading to the childhood scene, after which the answer arrives with little resistance. There is no significant external opposition and very little internal pushback once the reawakening begins, so tension remains low. The resulting conflict is more meditative than testing, which limits escalation and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving or decoding the runaway dream—is signaled early and sustains the piece, and the sunrise attempt plus darkroom revelation form a coherent tightening of pressure in an accumulative mode. However, there is minimal genuine jeopardy or resistance: the ritual unfolds without obstacles, doubts, or near-misses that might test her commitment. The emotional reversal (not the courtyard, but a charged abstraction revealing an inner “home”) is effective but arrives without on-page challenge or real alternative path. As a result, tension feels more atmospheric than truly escalating, limiting conflict-driven intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea of enduring love from a prison of fear—is clear and thematically weighty but not strongly pressured on the page. Once the star appears, the sequence from discovery of the fracture to successful release is smooth, with no real chance of failure, setback, or ethical trade-off, so escalation feels mostly like ceremonial deepening rather than narrowing options. The tactic shift (tenderness instead of force) is conceptually strong but arrives more as explanation than as a hard-won adaptation under duress. As a result, the climax is moving yet low in felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can he bear to recover what he once let the ring erase—is clear from early on and coherently drives the scene. Pressure escalates through his methodical watching until the alignment forms and forces a confrontation with the memory he’s sought and feared. The cost is emotional rather than external, but it’s palpable in the recovered scene with Elara and the tears of “profound release and understanding.” The only slight limitation is how smoothly the ritual succeeds on first attempt; there’s little on-page resistance once he commits to the method.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to reject or engage in a path that might reverse her exile—is clear and stable. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively from her outright dismissal, through Kael’s demonstration, to her reluctant participation and finally her own annotation. The decisive turn is internal and quiet; there is little sense of external jeopardy or immediate cost beyond emotional risk, which fits the mode but keeps intensity at a mid-high level rather than urgent. Still, the narrowing from refusal to active engagement reads earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—saving wonder from encroaching grayness—is stated and visually encoded in the chromatic tapestry and the fading gold-green. However, the process unfolds without any meaningful resistance or reversal; Elara perceives the threat, gathers bright strands, and succeeds on the first, unchallenged attempt. Escalation is more a deepening of imagery than a tightening of pressure or narrowing of options. As a result, the act of succor feels serene and inevitable rather than risky, so the felt cost and tension remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—grounding the restless spirits and, implicitly, whether Elara can bear and transform this accumulated grief—remains coherent and steadily deepens as each knot releases a more painful memory. Escalation is primarily emotional and textural, culminating in the dense, pulsing final knot and the revealed sacrifice that releases the chamber. However, the process is relatively frictionless: there is little sense that she might fail, hesitate, or pay a sharper price in the moment, which softens tension. The cost is real but inward and understated, keeping the conflict strong yet short of fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and ethical—how to “reopen” a severed dialogue without appropriation—and that’s clear but very low-friction. Escalation exists primarily as deepening insight: the key turn is the discovery that the older shadow alignment points to the vault, then to a specific star, reconfiguring the chapel and henge as an intentional observatory. There is almost no genuine resistance or sacrifice; once the footage is cued up, the universe yields its pattern without meaningful pushback. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than pressured, limiting the conflict score in an elite-venue context.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—can Aris reconfigure his relationship to loss—tethered to the external task of recovering and restoring the final transmission. Pressure accumulates via effort and focus rather than overt obstacles: the forty-minute untangling of the tape and the anticipation of the log provide a modest but real tightening. The final turn (hearing Evans and re-seeing the globe) is earned, yet there’s little in the way of escalating jeopardy or difficult trade-offs, so tension never fully sharpens. For a lyric piece this is adequate, but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure exists but remains very soft: the primary tension is the brief window between lightning and thunder and the ephemeral nature of the carvings versus their hoped-for permanence. There is one meaningful tightening—the countdown and then the commitment to carve, culminating in the final sigil before thunder—but no true opposition, risk, or trade-off beyond effort and solitude. Stakes are affective and conceptual (will the silent be “heard”?) rather than situationally sharp. The lack of concrete resistance or cost keeps the conflict from fully blooming.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to understand joy within anguish—is clear, and the tension modestly deepens as he reads progressively more painful and tender entries. The key turn is the deciphering of the diary and the final entry’s reconfiguration of how he sees grief, which is thematically potent but gently contested. External stakes and direct pressure are minimal; nothing pushes back against him besides his own sadness and empathy. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than urgent, limiting the sense of true escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris can transform grief into a meaningful memorial, proving that absence retains shape—is clear and present early. Escalation is subtle but real: from routine categorization to nimbostratus “grief,” through turbulence and fear, to the charged encounter with the geometric void. The main limitation is that pressure remains mostly internal and gently modulated; Aris’s agency is primarily in sustained attention and meaning-making rather than sharply constrained choices under duress. Still, the decision to interpret the fallstreak hole as Elara’s imprint and accept peace reads as a crystallized stance with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—losing the murals and her attempt to preserve or re-understand the sky—are clear, with time pressure from the imminently demolished building. The key tightening is her discovery of the coin, which deepens and redirects the internal conflict by reframing what “preserving the sky” can mean. However, the external conflict remains largely static (demolition is inevitable, no contested choice) and the internal struggle is resolved with relative smoothness once the coin appears. The piece could gain pressure from one more concrete, resisted alternative (e.g., stealing or documenting her work) tested on the page before she renounces it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the ship’s light and honoring the crew’s legacy—is clear from early on and pays off in the climactic insertion of the orb. Pressure does increase as Elara notices the starling sequence and commits hours to decoding the cipher, but practical opposition is minimal and there’s no true reversal or genuine risk of failure on the page. Her agency drives the resolution, yet it feels largely frictionless once the clue appears, so the sense of cost or foreclosed alternative remains soft. The conflict reads as gentle intellectual puzzle rather than sharply tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing the celestial regulator in time to embody her mentor’s lesson—is clear and present throughout, and the choice to uncap and replace the gear is a meaningful tightening. Pressure deepens when the light reveals “more than breakage,” forcing a reevaluation from simple fixing to listening and reharmonizing. However, practical risk (that she might fail, damage the mechanism, or be too late) is more atmospheric than specific, so escalation remains predominantly emotional and contemplative. The ending shows a credible price in effort and interior shift but not a sharply dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the blight-stricken orchard that underpins the family’s survival and cohesion—is clear from early on and sharpened by the eerie precision of the messages. There is one meaningful tightening when the “watering bell” is reinterpreted as a harmonic key tied to a narrow cosmological window, forcing coordinated, time-sensitive action. However, once that revelation lands, the path to success contains little resistance: the mirror rigging and alignment proceed without mishap, and the cure works flawlessly on the first attempt. The emotional cost is largely offloaded to Elara’s graceful exit, which is thematically resonant but feels less like the result of agonized choice than of benign inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can encode the lullaby into reality before the universe’s final tick—is clearly signaled and carried through to the clock striking midnight. Pressure escalates texturally (approach to the lantern room, alignment of energies, activation of the pane, hum and ensuing silence) culminating in the silent flare and cosmic reweaving. However, there’s no real reversal or on-page risk that her attempt might fail; once the method is named, each step proceeds without meaningful obstruction or trade-off beyond the abstract cost of reality ending. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative and beautiful rather than tense, limiting the sense of escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stakes—guiding travelers out before frost triggers memory-stealing labyrinth shifts—are established early and tracked well via twilight-to-frost timing. The main tightening comes with finding the nut at the Sentinel Tree under time pressure and the assembly/whistle working just as frost begins, plus her internal choice to endure this role another day. Still, the external conflict remains relatively frictionless (the malevolent Tree never truly pushes back), and her internal struggle is more summarized than dramatized in the act, so escalation feels solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains in self-protective isolation or moves toward ethical, relational reconnection with Elara—is clear from early on and resolved decisively by the end. Pressure builds via accumulative deepening rather than external conflict, with the chrysalis and bubble patterns progressively narrowing his interpretive options until the insight “crystallizes.” However, there is little sense of live alternative beyond “stay stuck” versus “reach out,” and the piece never really tests his resolve once the realization hits. The cost of atonement is gestured at but not sharply etched in terms of what he might concretely lose.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can authentically locate or create the true beginning of story—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. There is one meaningful tightening when “the absence pressed against her skin, dense and demanding,” prompting her decisive incision; this deepens the pressure but doesn’t strongly foreground a sense of potential failure or loss. The cost of acting (or not) remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, so tension is elegant but muted. The external turn (the first customer’s arrival) nicely validates her choice but introduces little additional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris can transform overwhelming, ancient remorse without breaking himself—is clear and escalates from reading the pool to touching the coral to enduring the flood of grief. His choice to “subsume the remorse entirely” is the main tightening, narrowing all options to endurance and transformation. The contagious sorrow and bone-deep exhaustion provide legible cost, though there’s little sense he might fail or be permanently damaged, slightly softening tension. Conflict remains primarily internal and could benefit from one sharper moment of doubt or near-collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the valley’s inter-silo communication—is clear and thematically rich, but the on-page conflict is low-friction: once the weight is found, nothing meaningfully resists Elara’s plan. Her methodology of interspersed languages operates without misfires or doubt, so escalation is mostly a gradual crescendo of voices rather than a tightening of options or rising cost. There is one mild deepening when the flood-scarred silo speaks and others respond, but this comes after the mechanical problem is already solved and doesn’t demand a new choice from Elara. The net effect is textural intensification rather than genuinely pressured decision-making, which is graceful but not dramatically taut.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can genuinely transition from engineer of systems to archeologist of dreams—is present and advanced, but pressure seldom feels acute. Escalation appears as intensifying emotional influx (settler, Native girl, soldier, miner), culminating in physical trembling and tears, which does deepen the internal conflict. However, options don’t feel meaningfully narrowed and no path is seriously jeopardized; there’s little sense she might fail, break, or turn back. The final acceptance therefore reads more as confirmation of an inevitable arc than a hard-won choice with sharp cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving forgotten combinations tied to erased histories—is signaled early and given a clear temporal pressure via the one-hour inversion window. The main tightening is her entry at the exact moment gravity flips, but from there the path is largely guided and hazard-free; no serious alternative or failure mode is tested on the page. Internal doubt or fear is mentioned but not dramatized into a concrete dilemma or sacrifice. As a result, tension is steady but never truly sharp, and the price of success is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can create respectful music within a sacred silence—is clear but faces little resistance. Pressure “escalates” mainly by deepening the emotional register of each strum rather than through narrowing options or real risk; she never seems in danger of failing or harming anything. The final note of “peace” and the siskin’s answering trill provide a gentle tightening and resolution, but the path there is smooth. As a result, tension is lyrical rather than gripping, limiting the conflict/stakes score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain trapped in exile-as-wound or reconfigure it into meaningful fidelity—is clear and tracks through the piece. Pressure builds texturally via the magnetic pulses and correlated memories, with the sharp energy spike (prince’s fist, demanded gambit) functioning as the key tightening beat. The cost is emotional and ethical rather than situational, embodied in his tears and the explicit acknowledgment of what was lost. The conflict remains relatively gentle and contemplative, so escalation feels more like deepening than genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary pressure is internal and ethical: can Elara authentically access and honor another’s silence without violation, and can she bear the emotional cost. Tension escalates through the resonator’s hum, the search for “the exact frequency where grief resonated,” and the eventual emotional wave that nearly overwhelms her. The stakes (empathic connection and potential healing) are clear and culminate in her commitment to visit Henderson, but opposition remains largely implicit, with little risk of failure beyond her own emotional limits. As a result, the conflict feels deep but relatively low-friction rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can cultivate this difficult corpse flower in a way that forges true serenity—is clear but gently pressed. There is mild escalation from anticipation through waiting to the first scent and sprout, but no sharp turn or meaningful narrowing of options; nothing serious threatens failure beyond implication. Internal pressure between sensitivity to odor and desire for serenity is thematically present yet under-tested on the page. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding a cure/source of resilience for the blighted groves—is clearly stated and held. There is a meaningful deepening when Kael realizes the source is a covenant to be protected rather than a resource to be extracted, which redefines his mission. However, escalation is mostly atmospheric; there are no strong reversals, concrete obstacles, or painful trade-offs on the page, and the “price” of renouncing direct use on the groves is only lightly sketched. The conflict thus reads as contemplative and low-friction rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—understanding the collapse to prevent future deaths—is clear and deepens as Kael uncovers resonance and the personal link to Croft. Pressure escalates conceptually (from wind measurements to realizing sustained oscillation, to the patch’s emotional weight), and his recommendations mark a meaningful stance. Still, the conflict remains primarily investigative and internal, with minimal resistance or trade-off; he is never forced into a truly costly, narrowing decision on the page. The result is intellectually engaging but comparatively low-friction in terms of dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving awe’s necessity through the success of the ritual—is signaled early and held throughout. Escalation is more about intensifying spectacle and density (more colors, more visions, the ice joining the song) than tightening pressure or narrowing options; there is no plausible chance of failure once the ritual starts. Elara’s agency is real in choosing to undertake and perform the ritual, but she is never forced into a difficult trade-off or visible sacrifice on the page beyond endurance. As a result, tension remains relatively low even at the climax, and the piece reads as a beautiful enactment rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can wrest genuine insight rather than hollow closure from his failure—is clear from the outset. Pressure deepens when the flute note opens the weave and he’s forced to rewatch the critical moment of deafness; his decision “to weave not to mend the irreparable tear, but to harvest its bitter lesson” is the key tightening that forecloses the fantasy of undoing the past. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than situational, but it’s felt in his tears and in the acceptance that guardianship is truly over. The conflict is largely internal and could accommodate a slightly sharper on-page pinch, yet it remains coherent and progressive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can withstand and integrate her transposed empathies without losing herself—is clear and escalates when grief and joy collide into panic. Pressure deepens as her surroundings distort and identity “frays,” forcing her to reach for constants and reframe her mathematical goal. The resolution, choosing to embrace ambiguity and continue printing, is earned and internally decisive, but the sense of price paid (what she cannot go back to) is somewhat underplayed. The conflict remains almost entirely internal, which works, but a slightly sharper articulation of what failure would mean could heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael remains a hollow, jittery functionary or rekindles a sense of wonder and purpose—is clear, and the germination scene is a genuine deepening. However, pressure is gentle; there’s no serious test of commitment or alternative path at the peak, and the pendant’s activation arrives as a largely unopposed gift. The escalation is more in imagery and meaning than in cost or narrowed options. As a result, the resolution feels moving but somewhat low-friction for elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will Kael confirm his theory and validate his anger, or face a more humbling truth—is clear and escalates as he reads the frost patterns as his own fury. The “shifted hush” and appearance of the spiral constitute a genuine tightening as his preferred interpretation is challenged and then overturned. The pressure remains mostly internal and contemplative; it’s effective but low-intensity, which slightly limits the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—transmitting love across decades at the price of her present world—is clear and thematically rich. Escalation appears as the accelerating raveling silence and the progressive loss of color and solidity as she weaves memories, which narrows her options to sacrifice or failure. Her agency is central at the crucial turn: she consciously feeds her sanctuary and self into the loom without regret. The pressure could be sharpened with a more palpable sense of risk or alternative, but it remains coherent and emotionally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving the shattered orchards and arches—is clear, and the emotional cost of the barter gives it weight. There is a single escalation from preparation into descent and ritual, but almost no resistance: the mine presents no danger, the magic functions seamlessly, and nothing tests his resolve after the off-page sacrifice. Internal conflict (his confusion about the price) is mentioned rather than dramatized in difficult choices. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the resolution feels low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Kael’s true final act versus the risk of being lost in the weave—is clear and sharpened when the energy turns “volatile, threatening to eject her into oblivion.” Escalation is primarily internal but does track: from exploration to sensory onslaught to near-ejection, forcing a choice about how she approaches the truth. Her decision to redirect intent is a genuine act of agency that resolves both survival and moral understanding, though the external danger is under-detailed and somewhat abstract. Overall, pressure grows coherently and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will assume and transmit the legacy of care in a now-empty lighthouse—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. There is one meaningful deepening when he decides not just to replicate but to invent the Phoenix Stack as a new, specific message for Elara. However, pressure remains gentle; the tension never truly threatens his core aim, and the external hazard of the unlit reef stays conceptual rather than dramatized. This yields a strong, quiet conflict that lacks the sharper narrowing of options associated with top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can harness the storm he inadvertently summons and steer it toward a gentler dawn—is clear and escalates from potential to active crisis once he laughs. His agency in steering, choosing specific glyphs, and persisting through strain earns the resolution. The cost is mostly internal and atmospheric (solitude, ongoing duty) rather than mapped onto a sharply cornering dilemma, which keeps this just shy of the very top band. Still, pressure grows coherently and releases in a satisfying, earned way.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why Kaela magnetized stories and what that means for Elara’s own heart—is clear and threads through the whole piece. Pressure escalates mainly via accumulation (waiting for the sun, the moment of blue eruption) rather than explicit opposition, and the main turn is her internal reconfiguration from collecting to holding space. The cost is a gentle renunciation of an acquisitive stance, felt in her tears and new resolve. The conflict never quite sharpens into a truly fraught dilemma, which keeps tension at a strong but not exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether quantified sorrow can be transformed so the sextant will work and open the trees’ testimony—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively gentle and mostly internal. The major tightening is the single charged moment when the storm stills, silence crystallizes, the pin drops, and the moonlight window opens, yet Elara’s response remains controlled rather than visibly fraught. Because the heavy lifting of “deconstruction” is safely in the past, there’s little sense that failure is truly possible now, which softens escalation. The resolution is earned conceptually but lacks a palpable price or difficult trade-off in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—rekindling light for a dying realm—is introduced early and followed through via the ritual, with the key tightening occurring when her scattered memory must deliver the “forgotten songs” or the Heartseed will fail. Escalation is more deepening than reversal: each new recalled song increases pressure and consequence, culminating in the woven dawn and communal chorus. The cost registers emotionally (a century of vigil, tears, strain of maintaining song, the weight of covenant) rather than via a concrete sacrifice or thwarted alternative, which keeps the tension slightly softer than the world-ending premise implies. Nonetheless, her agency is clear, the resolution stems from her choices, and the final transformation feels earned within this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain imprisoned by guilt or reconfigure her solitude into purposeful guardianship—is clear early and followed through. Pressure escalates via the time-locked solstice ritual and the tension of whether she will in some sense “return” to the society. The major turn is her realization that the society has already reinterpreted her mistake, allowing her to relinquish self-punishment while choosing not to physically reappear yet. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so the emotional jeopardy never feels razor-edged, but it is coherent and does tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform quiet noticing of erosion into an act of resilient care—is clear but kept at a meditative simmer. There is a gentle deepening when gardening is followed by the bread’s reappearance, reweighting her ritual as effective rather than merely symbolic. However, antagonistic pressure is minimal: nothing meaningfully resists her, and the emotional risk remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in hard choices. As a result, tension is steady but low, more atmospheric than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—salvaging the essence of the vow before it fades—is clearly signaled and slightly tightened by the live decay of amplitudes and the slide’s final violent flicker. The pressure is situational and conceptual rather than confrontational; there’s no antagonist, only entropy. Escalation is modest: as each measured band grows weaker, the urgency to capture what remains increases until the illusion extinguishes. The resolution (archive the data, move on to the next slide) feels coherent but doesn’t force a sharp trade-off or visible reconfiguration of options beyond steady endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—protecting the hush and preventing Hemlock’s framing while capturing the key sound—are clear and active from early on. Pressure escalates through the sequence of thwarted plots to the breaking of the truce and the accusation, with the crowd’s reaction serving as both triumph (for the recording) and danger (potential violence). However, Elara’s strategies work almost too cleanly; there’s little sense of irreversible loss, sacrifice, or a real risk that she might fail, which softens the felt cost. The final confrontation resolves briskly once she produces evidence, limiting the moral or tactical corner she’s truly forced into.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconcile skepticism with the possibility that “personal weather” is real and meaningful—is clear and present from early on. Pressure does escalate in a gentle, accumulative way as she moves from doubt to trying the ring, to following its increasingly intense tastes, to entering the stone circle as the forest’s election concludes. However, the conflict remains largely internal and is resolved without any serious risk or difficult trade-off; once she commits to the experiment, nothing on the page truly threatens her goal. The cost is mostly conceptual (loss of skepticism, surrender to wonder), which lands, but could be sharpened by a more concrete or painful on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain self-exiled from her art or reclaim it as a conduit to Lily—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure rises as she risks drawing again, then deepens with the supernatural response and Lily’s explicit plea in the note. However, the path from suppression to acceptance is relatively smooth; there’s little resistance or jeopardy once she decides to sketch, so escalation feels more like steady unveiling than hard-tested conflict. The cost of reopening her grief is implied but not significantly dramatized in contested beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—locating where lost conversations go / resolving her affliction with lies—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates quietly as her journey shifts from chasing a concrete “haven of echoes” to following a compass of small candor moments, culminating in the disappointment and revaluation of the empty chamber. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic: she relinquishes the fantasy of a stable archive in favor of ongoing, vulnerable work in the world. That subtlety suits the piece, but it keeps the escalation from feeling fully sharp or narrowing; several waypoints feel like lyric confirmations more than genuine squeezes.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—holding back the world’s grayness by preserving blue—exists but is mostly asserted rather than tested. There is no serious chance of failure or meaningful alternative path; the ritual proceeds smoothly, with no complication beyond the inherent expenditure of the shard’s light. Escalation is emotional and atmospheric (crescendo of bells and light) rather than conflict-driven. The final stance is earned but the pressure never truly tightens in a way that forecloses options or demands sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Unit Seven transmute chaotic, painful memory into integrated peace—is clearly signaled once the static begins and tightens as it commits to and performs the burn ritual. Agency drives escalation: retrieving the box, crafting the lens, and placing each object into the beam are deliberate steps that deepen the commitment. However, tension remains very controlled; the story preemptively assures us there’s “no risk to the dome,” and internal hesitation or potential failure are barely dramatized, which blunts a sense of real jeopardy or trade-off. The emotional price is present but somewhat low-intensity for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—saving the mailbox and healing an old communal wound through listening—are legible early and coherently pressed by the noon deadline. Escalation is modest but present: accumulating story-fragments, the impending removal, and Elara’s decision to finally open the locket and then the mailbox in front of witnesses. The emotional cost is primarily communal grief and Mr. Henderson’s long-held guilt, with Elara’s risk centered on potential failure to redeem her philosophy rather than a personal sacrifice. The conflict resolves a bit gently, with little real threat that listening might not be enough.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the message correctly enough to trigger rescue while transforming despair into strength—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when she realizes "Listen" refers to the pressure gauge chime and must time her action to the third note. Her frustration and the resistance of the cipher provide real internal conflict, and the moment of timing the valve with "dancer’s precision" reads as a peak choice. Still, external jeopardy is somewhat abstracted (we don’t feel immediate danger from oxygen, structural failure, or a looming deadline), so the sense of risk and concrete loss remains gentler than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the erased memory of Lyra’s farewell—is clear and emotionally grounded, and the chamber sequence provides a concrete external obstacle. The gravity pockets introduce real risk and a form of escalation as she approaches the pulsing geode. However, this pressure never quite sharpens into a genuine sense that she might fail or pay a heavier price; once she reaches the crystal, the solution unfolds with relatively little resistance. The result is emotionally satisfying but somewhat low-tension for elite short fiction standards.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—neutralizing a prophecy that breeds communal dread—is clear and present from early on. There is some escalation as she narrows in on the “fracture” and encounters the cold sting of the coded words. However, opposition is purely textural: the prophecy never pushes back, and Elara never faces a serious risk of failure or meaningful trade-off in the moment. The conflict thus feels beautifully described but low-friction, with no true reversal or tightening that forces a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s way of relating to the building’s history and to truth itself—is clear, and it does evolve by the end. Conflict, however, is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; Mrs. Davison is a gentle guide rather than a source of genuine pressure. The main “tightening” is conceptual, as the agreed-upon lie forces Elara to reconsider her investigative stance, but there’s no serious alternative path she might believably take. As a result, tension is present but muted, more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—whether she will continue to quarantine the memory or risk integrating it—is clear and present throughout, with the ritual acting as the pressure crucible. Stakes are inherently internal but felt: either remain isolated or transform grief into a new, less haunted self-relation. The escalation is more steady than sharp; once she commits to the ritual, there’s little sense it might backfire, so tension is contemplative rather than suspenseful. The cost (relinquishing the protective quarantine and accepting permanent, transmuted grief) is legible, but a beat of genuine doubt or near-failure could sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Kael can forgive himself and complete Elian’s “unfinished”—is clear, and the pressure does intensify as he engages the sanctuary’s mechanism (thorn → keyhole → key → silence). Internal and external layers intersect well: the ritual’s stages mirror his psychological unbinding. However, escalation is relatively gentle; there’s no serious counter-force or credible alternative path once he begins, so the choice feels less like a risk and more like a solemn inevitability. The piece might reach a higher band if his hesitation, doubt, or fear of unworthiness introduced more friction before the key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—whether Elara can understand and release the trapped echoes—remains coherent, and there is one clear tightening when the shell reveals Kael’s lie, raising the moral weight of what’s at play. However, antagonistic pressure is almost absent: no one resists her, the shell offers unchallenged guidance, and her song succeeds on the first attempt without visible risk or sacrifice. As a result, the arc feels more like a guided ritual than a conflict that forces hard choices or trade-offs. The emotional cost is present but gentle, limiting tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reframing the narrative of Flight 422 to salvage a “pure” last memory for Eleanor—is clear but faces almost no on-page resistance. Pressure escalates only gently: the discovery of Clara’s final joyful thought leads directly to the plan to write the letter; nothing seriously challenges Elara’s course or values. The final act of exposing the truth through Lena is a meaningful internal decision, yet there’s little sense of risk, trade-off, or loss attached to it. As a result, tension remains low and the piece leans heavily on atmosphere and theme over conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—his search for his proper relation to hidden patterns—and that’s signaled early through his reverent mending and tea ritual. The main escalation is the choice to whistle, inviting response, and the fireflies’ reorganization is a satisfying deepening that reweights his stance. However, pressure never sharpens into a genuine dilemma or trade-off; there’s no meaningful option he must forgo or risk he must face beyond the possibility of being ignored. The piece works as a lyric meditation, but tension remains low and the cost of his “audacity” is almost entirely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose or preserve the myth of the cursed diamond/orchard—is signaled early and deepens as she uncovers Dr. Thorne’s deception and the corporate origin of the Liquidation. Escalation is primarily conceptual and ethical rather than event-driven, culminating in a clear renunciation with cost (abandoning her debunking mandate). Internal and external stakes interweave: professional identity vs survival of a rare biosphere. The absence of a countervailing on-page antagonist or time pressure keeps the tension from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s subversive, oblique transmissions can seed an alternative to Kael’s rigid order—is clear, and tension coherently builds toward the narrow window of clear transmission. Her agency in choosing riddling, risky specificity at the solstice moment drives the key external turn (the vault opening) and internal turn (her vigil validated). However, the conflict remains relatively low-friction: Kael’s power and any direct counterpressure stay largely off-stage, and she is never forced into a sharp trade-off beyond long-term endurance. As a result, escalation feels meaningful but not particularly harrowing or constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are largely internal—can he transmute regret into a meaningful offering—and they remain gentle throughout. The main tightening is when the music box’s lullaby connects to Elara, prompting the focused act of capturing and dedicating the jar. There’s no real opposition (external or internal) to that decision; success feels assured once he begins. As a result, tension and escalation are present but muted, more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the Chime and, by extension, the marina from destructive tremors—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates when the stabilizer fails and Elara must resort to a “forgotten method,” and the iterative tuning (strike, listen, refine) shows adaptation under stress. However, each iteration trends steadily positive with no real setback or painful trade-off, so tension plateaus rather than sharply tightening. The resolution is firmly driven by her agency, but the price she pays is mostly effort and concentration rather than a consequential loss or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elara can successfully initiate a “patient revolution” by completing this ultra-precise cosmic ritual—remains clear, and her internal struggle to transmute impatience into patience tracks the pressure. There is a meaningful tightening as the moon rises and the viaduct begins to glow, forcing her to act with surrender instead of force. However, conflict is largely contemplative; the ritual succeeds without resistance or visible danger of failure, so the pressure never quite feels tested. The cost is mostly implied in accumulated waiting rather than dramatized jeopardy in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—exposing the society’s lethal control—is clearly articulated, and the lantern’s discovery does deepen her understanding. However, pressure doesn’t materially tighten: there’s no on-page opposition, time constraint, or genuine risk that forces a difficult trade-off. The investigation unfolds smoothly, with the evidence lining up neatly and no reversal beyond interpretive deepening. As a result, the final resolve feels meaningful but not hard-won under escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his helpless remorse into meaningful, forward-looking action—is signaled early and stays coherent. External conflict is modest (will the heart be repairable?) but functions as a concrete test of his belief in second chances and his fear of a “second execution.” Pressure tightens when Horvath initially echoes the first repairer’s assessment and then pauses in the “calm before realization,” making the discovery of the fracture feel like a real turn. The cost is internal rather than dramatic—accepting irreversible failure with Samuel while committing to future inmates—but it is clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—will she succeed in manifesting this impossible, future-ringing bell—is clear from early on. However, most of the struggle is summarized ("Months bled into a tapestry...") rather than dramatized in specific tests, so pressure feels more thematic than scene-level. The main escalation is the kaleidoscope’s shift to a "single, unbroken circle," which works as a conceptual tightening but encounters little on-page resistance beyond implied difficulty. The cost is primarily accumulated effort and solitude, not a concrete trade-off in the climax itself, which keeps tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—truth and rescue versus obedience/safety—is legible early and tightened meaningfully when Vance orders her to close the file, forcing the lie. The discovery of Psi and Lena’s message raises the ethical stakes, transforming Elara’s curiosity into responsibility. However, the external danger remains mostly implied; corporate consequence and rival threats stay offstage, so tension is primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The result is a credible but relatively quiet escalation, strong for introspective SF but shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the orchard/ice relationship—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening when the glimpses reveal beauty, fear, and hope that must be synthesized. However, escalation is mostly conceptual and proceeds without serious resistance; the mirrors yield what’s needed, the synthesis succeeds on first attempt, and the reconstitution/planting face no on-page obstacle. The “courageous anomaly” is never truly tested against a hard alternative (flight, despair, or catastrophic error), so the price of their stance remains relatively abstract. Tension exists, but it never quite tightens into felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will stance herself toward her impending euthanasia and the nature of “endings”—is clear, and pressure accumulates quietly through the net haul, the journal’s resurfacing, and the fireside community. The journal’s line about ice memory and the experience of belonging tighten the conflict by offering a new frame that could, in theory, derail her original plan. Yet the story stops short of putting her under a sharp on-page test of that plan; her decision to keep the appointment remains relatively unpressured, keeping escalation in the strong-but-not-searing band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara and Liam fracture or re-open their connection after a crisis—is clear from the outset and deepens through their recalled misread gestures. Elara’s choice to intervene with the letter fragment and vine metaphor is the key tightening moment that changes their interpretive frame. However, once she steps in, conflict resolves with minimal pushback; they pivot to understanding quickly, so escalation feels more like a single soft step than a tested struggle. The cost is present but gentle, more emotional reframing than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve a fragile, fading echo—is clear from early on and provides a mild but steady time pressure. Escalation is primarily textural: deepening stillness, more precise alignment with the parapet, and the concentration required to hold peripheral focus. Opposition is largely procedural rather than antagonistic, so tension reads as meditative strain rather than sharp conflict. The final choice to trust the clearing and walk away is earned, but the sense of what could be lost never becomes viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—whether the town can reframe its pain into communal healing—is clear, but on-page pressure is gentle and largely unopposed. Liam’s initial tension dissolves quickly with little resistance, and no encounter meaningfully threatens Elara’s project or forces a costly trade-off. Escalation is more about broadening participation than tightening stakes, so the emotional price of change never feels sharply tested. This keeps the piece affecting but limits its dramatic intensity for a “prestige” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will truly decode the “pattern of growth” and what he will do with that knowledge—is clear, and the pressure deepens when the familiar fragments give way to the nonhuman sounds that reframe his quest. His agency is evident in choosing to interpret this as a pattern, then to “testify” through restoration instead of clinging to the crystal as a private tool. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and quite gentle; there’s little sense that he might refuse, misinterpret, or falter, so escalation feels more like an inevitable dawn than a hard-won decision. The felt price of leaving his world behind could be sharpened to heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—finding and capturing the sound of growing older—is clear early, and the pressure does deepen as the visions flash and vanish, culminating in the transient chair and the grief of immediate forgetting. Escalation is primarily emotional and textural, not decision-driven: the key reversal is the chair’s appearance and loss, which reweights her longing rather than forcing a hard trade-off in action. The cost is felt but relatively subtle; there’s little sense that any genuine option is foreclosed beyond what her condition already dictated.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the risk of losing the once-in-decades Lunar Veil observation—is clearly stated and tied to the malfunctioning Chronometer. Pressure escalates from environmental danger (quake) to technical threat (spinning second hand, imminent timing loss) to an internal, craft-driven decision about how to intervene. However, the urgency remains more atmospheric than visceral; the 1.7-second window is conceptually high-stakes but not dramatized with tight, on-page countdown or real possibility of failure. The resolution feels earned but gentle, with modest on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the goodbye will be numb or meaningfully connective—is clear from Elara’s entrance. Pressure escalates in a subtle, accumulative way: from tense silence, to song that resurrects mundane memories, to the pivotal move where Lena and Arthur physically share the shard. The internal conflict (clinging to grief vs. risking remembrance) could be more explicitly dramatized, but the emotional deepening reads as a genuine tightening of stakes. The resolution feels earned, with the price being a fuller confrontation with what is being lost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—solving the noon-shadow mystery / repairing reality after the Spoon-Bending—is clear and tied to Elara’s actions. There is one meaningful tightening when the orrery shudders and grinds against corrupted instructions, forcing her to apply the new rune. However, once she makes that correction, the path to success feels smooth, with minimal sense of danger, trade-off, or alternative outcomes. Conflict is present and coherent but reads as relatively low-pressure and foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to or dismantle the changeling narrative and how she’ll re-enter the community—is signaled and maintained. There is one clear deepening beat when she identifies the cleft in the tooth and lets the village story “shatter.” However, opposition is fully offstage, so there’s no on-page test of her resolve, no trade-off that bites in the moment, and no meaningful narrowing of options beyond an internal choice that seems aligned with her nature from the outset. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can Elara create a safe, non-fire light for Liam and thereby soothe his fear—is clearly stated and emotionally grounded. Tension, however, remains low-key; there is no real sense that the attempt might fail, nor are there meaningful obstacles or trade-offs enacted in scene. The polishing process and weighing provide gentle deepening rather than escalation. As a result, the ending satisfies more as lyric resolution than as a hard-won turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains defined by public shame or can reframe her regret—is clear and tightened by her choice to part with the pendant. Pressure escalates mostly through deepening commitment to the ritual (following the pattern, reaching the altar, leaving the pendant) rather than reversals, which suits the accumulative design. The cost—relinquishing a cherished link to Lena and accepting that healing won’t erase the past—is felt but kept at a gentle temperature. The lack of any counter-pressure on the page (Lena or digital hostility remaining offstage) keeps tension from reaching truly high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—what kind of ending he will choose for his novel—is clear, but actual pressure and escalation remain relatively flat. Each cameo is similar in weight and no single beat sharply tightens his options or forces a painful trade-off. His declared resistance to nihilism is strong from early on, so the final choice confirms rather than severely tests that stance. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than tense, limiting stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the grove’s spiritual life—is clear, and the “when everything aligns” moment offers a structural tightening. However, there is almost no sense that Elara might fail or that any meaningful path is being foreclosed; opposition is entirely absent and the ritual proceeds smoothly once begun. Internal and external conflict thus remain minimal, with tension residing mostly in atmospheric anticipation rather than real pressure. This keeps the piece beautiful but relatively low in dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes—can she transmute a dying orchard’s heartbeat into a durable map of renewal—are clear and scale appropriately to the piece’s quiet scope. Pressure builds in an accumulative way through the meticulous setup, the blood-drop, and the moment where flash-paper might annihilate her effort, with the non-burning reading as the key turn. The cost is present but modestly rendered: blood loss, exhaustion, the risk of losing an irreplaceable celestial alignment. What keeps this from a higher band is that no decision undercuts a cherished alternative; the conflict remains mostly success-vs-failure rather than a charged trade between competing goods or harms.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—repairing the timer to enable the harvest of echoes—is legible, and there is a mild deepening as Kael realizes the true failure is misalignment rather than damage. However, there is almost no genuine opposition or risk; success never feels truly in doubt. Escalation is more procedural (dawn, mid-morning, noon, dusk) than pressured, and no choice forecloses a significant path with on-page cost. The result is aesthetically pleasing but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can solidify this amorphous anxiety without losing her empathetic orientation—is clear but softly pressed. There is one meaningful tightening when the anxiety resists definition and she must recall her master’s teaching and adjust the weave. After that adjustment, the path to success feels relatively smooth, with minimal sense of risk or trade-off beyond craft difficulty. The ending acknowledges her solitude as cost, but that pressure could be more directly tested by the on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will be swallowed by grief or manage to contain and integrate it—is signaled early and coheres through the ritual frame. Pressure tightens mainly via the temporally bounded carving session and the focused memory of Leo’s tenderness, with the kettle whistle as a mild but clear pivot away from immersion toward integration. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through painful on-page renunciation, which is appropriate but keeps the tension subdued. As a result, the piece feels more like a beautifully sustained meditation than a conflict that truly threatens to overwhelm her.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether Elara can reconcile with her uneroded younger self—comes through early and is maintained cleanly. Conflict escalates through the accumulating regret-fragments and culminates in the negotiation/integration scene, with her apology and reframing (“Erosion is part of the art”) functioning as the key turn. The emotional price is legible in her tears and the acknowledgment of fear, but the ghost offers almost no resistance, so the negotiation feels more like a gentle convergence than a pressured confrontation. This softness limits the felt narrowing of options and keeps the tension band below elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this dead terminal can be given a new kind of life—is clear but remains abstract and low-risk; failure would mean disappointment, not real loss. There is a gentle escalation from discovery to labor to the moment of uncertain waiting before the water gurgles, but no meaningful reversals, resistance, or tightened options beyond simple physical effort. Her success feels virtually assured once she begins the work, so the “gurgle” is more confirmation than sharp turn. The conflict is functional and coherent but lacks bite or genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can genuinely make peace with her abandoned musical dream—is clear from the outset. Pressure escalates internally: the weight of regret, the trembling approach, then the irreversible act of sounding the fork and leaving it behind. The resonance moment functions as the key tightening, forcing her to re-interpret her life’s work rather than simply mourn it. It remains a quiet, largely internal conflict, but for a lyric piece the escalation and price (relinquishing the fork and the old narrative of failure) are convincingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reclaim integrity and accurately perceive Thorne’s deception—tightens when she decodes the hidden coordinates and re-reads every prior “clue.” The major escalation is knowledge-deepening rather than external danger, but it does reweight her options between vengeance versus documentation. Her final choice to become a “guardian of authenticity” is clearly motivated and forecloses a path, with a visible internal cost linked to past shame. What’s missing, at this echelon, is a sharper on-page test of her resolve or a concrete external pressure beyond reflective realization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—securing the fulgurite/seed and, more deeply, preserving methods—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains very gentle. The decoding of the rope is the primary tightening, yet there is no real resistance from the fisherman or environment beyond the interpretive labor. Escalation is mostly conceptual rather than felt as narrowing options or risk. This keeps the piece poised and lovely but limits dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can truly understand and honor Isolde’s “absence”—is clear early and resolves in a credible stance shift at the end. Pressure builds modestly through her ritual attempt and the uncertainty about what she will find, then deepens via Kael’s articulation of healing as rooted growth. Still, tension remains largely contemplative, with no genuine risk of failure or serious alternative path debated, so escalation feels more like steady illumination than a narrowing corridor. The emotional price is present but soft-focus.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty can be resurrected or only remembered in a degraded world—is established early and escalates through the preparation and execution of the ritual. The key tightening is the moment the egg cracks and reveals not a chick but light, which forces a trade-off between Kaelen’s desire for literal rebirth and his acceptance of spectral, transient beauty. Internal and external conflict interweave as the mechanical world’s limitations concretely thwart his ideal. The pressure is coherent and satisfying but remains largely contemplative rather than sharply contested, which slightly mutes the sense of peril.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her inherited scar into compassionate purpose—is legible and consistent. Pressure escalates internally as she moves from ritual actions to the emotionally charged memory of her father and finally to a conscious reframing of his legacy. However, the conflict never quite sharpens into a moment where she risks choosing rejection or bitterness; the outcome feels likely from the outset. As a result, the deepening is resonant but lacks a distinct, high-cost inflection point.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—liberating the city’s memories before the box’s magic fades—is explicit and coherent, and there is a clear tightening toward the alignment at the Grand Celestial Basin. However, Elara encounters little real resistance; each breadcrumb works on the first attempt, and there are no genuine reversals or difficult trade-offs beyond managing doubt. The deadline (before dawn, during the geese’s pause) adds some pressure, but we never feel options meaningfully narrowing or a price she might pay for failure. As a result, escalation is present but modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without triggering catastrophic fire—is strongly signaled and thematically integrated with generational trauma. There is some escalation in the move from tentative pings to the “master ping” and garden-wide dawn. However, pressure never tightens via a genuine reversal or narrowed options; each step works as intended, so the risk feels conceptual rather than viscerally present. Without at least one serious on-page wobble or sacrifice, the conflict reads more as a beautiful ritual than a truly pressured endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to represent communal grief after a mass death—is strong and present from early on, with the bridge collapse giving it tangible weight. Pressure does deepen when Lyra appears and demands she “retrace the path of memory,” forcing Elara into emotionally loaded recollection rather than abstract design. However, the conflict remains predominantly contemplative and harmonious; there is little escalation in the sense of options narrowing or values colliding, and no real risk of failure is felt in the moment. The resulting memorial concept is persuasive but arrives without much friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary stake—restoring the clock and thus the community’s temporal order—is clear and established early, but the on-page opposition is relatively soft (grit in the pivot, emotional weight of legacy rather than a hard obstacle). Escalation occurs as the silent clock’s consequences are sketched and then as Elara confronts the pendulum’s pause and searing reverie, which deepens the internal pressure. Her choice to push the bob and then refine its swing, claiming her own inscription, resolves the conflict in a quiet, earned way. The cost is more ethical and ongoing than immediate, so tension remains more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Albright’s true intention behind his puzzling resignation—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains very gentle. Each thread yields insight without genuine obstruction, reversal, or significant risk of misreading; Elara’s success feels assured from the outset. The emotional cost (Liam’s hurt, the town’s confusion) is mostly background rather than dramatized tension in the scene itself. The result is a beautifully textured but largely unpressured progression, more meditative than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict is internal: Elara’s fear of being wrong versus her responsibility to act on a rigorous model for her people’s sake. There is one meaningful tightening—the passage where she interrogates each data source and convergent evidence to push back against doubt—and that does deepen pressure. However, the stakes (the kingdom’s stagnation, possible catastrophe if she miscalculates) are mostly declared rather than dramatized, and there is no external resistance or concrete consequence on the page. As a result, tension remains relatively low-grade, more contemplative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—risking punishment to smuggle stories back into the world—is well signaled, and the need for secrecy guides her behavior throughout. Pressure tightens in the interference/crackle moment and cloak slip, but external danger never quite materializes beyond implication, keeping conflict more atmospheric than confrontational. Internal conflict (safety vs. storytelling) is woven in, culminating in her explicit recommitment at the end. Escalation is present but modest; one sharper on-page test of risk would strengthen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the ritual can meaningfully “crystallize” hidden grief into acknowledged vulnerability—is clear, but tension is mostly conceptual and low-pressure. The one discernible “clock” is the chair’s slowing motion, which offers a gentle tightening rather than a true escalation with hard choices or trade-offs. Elara never seems in danger of failing or paying a visible personal price; everything unfolds as a foregone, controlled success. This keeps conflict from rising to elite-literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose the tablet and risk his archive or hide it and preserve truth for later—is clear and escalated effectively by the artifact’s implications. The tablet discovery is a solid tightening beat that forces a real trade-off between impact and safety. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and intellectual; Valerius and the surface threat are conceptual rather than present, which softens immediate tension. The final renunciation of revelation does carry cost but not at a visceral level.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether these divided townspeople can unlearn hatred enough to truly sing together—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure escalates quietly but credibly: initial avoidance and tension, then practicing subtraction of noise, then small but significant acts of trust (Anya supporting Liam’s falter) culminating in the solstice gathering without prompting. The cost is emotional and relational rather than dramatic; there’s no sharp external crisis to narrow options, which keeps tension more meditative than gripping. Still, the final offering and verbal acknowledgment represent a real narrowing of the "stay enemies" path.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Arlo can transform neglect and painful history into living, nourishing beauty—is legible and resolved. However, opposition is almost entirely passive (overgrowth, decay), and there is little escalation beyond the magical intensification at the celestial peak. His choices, while meaningful, are rarely contested or costly; he never seems in danger of failing or of choosing a harmful path. The piece reads as a contemplative ritual more than a pressured conflict, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the drones failed and what that means for future design—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Aris arrives already desperate, yet once Kael gestures to the box, the path to resolution faces no resistance, dilemma, or trade-off. Kael’s truthfulness and Aris’s openness align too neatly; there’s no moment where telling the truth threatens reputation, livelihood, or system stability. The piece reads as a beautifully rendered clarification rather than a conflict that meaningfully narrows options or exacts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand house "aliveness"—is signaled early and resolved in a quiet but legible way. The main tightening is the moment she plants the shard and the hush descends, deepening rather than dramatically escalating pressure. Conflict remains largely contemplative and unopposed; there is minimal sense of risk if she fails, and the cost of her new understanding is implied but soft. The piece works as a lyric meditation, but the pressure curve is gentle for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether a rigid, self-destroyed city can be reoriented toward nuance and renewed—is present and thematically coherent. There is one main tightening when Kael commits to using the ampoule via the spire’s flaw, leading to irreversible revelations. However, opposition is almost entirely off-page and historical; the “residual consciousnesses” never meaningfully resist, and no alternative path feels live once the piece begins. As a result, tension remains conceptual and meditative rather than truly escalating, and the outcome feels relatively assured.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can she transform her relationship to an irretrievable regret within an unescapable system—is clear and signaled early. Pressure escalates meaningfully when the Rupture Theorem finally works, forcing a real choice: step through or stay and verify/absorb, thus narrowing her options decisively. Internal and external conflicts (regret vs fidelity; prison vs sanctuary) interweave well. The escalation is more one big deepening than a sequence of turns, so tension never quite reaches a knife’s edge, but it remains coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether kindness can be remembered and re-spoken by strangers—is clear, but the pressure around it remains gentle and largely conceptual. The main escalation is the move from private ritual to public test at the bus stop, followed by the nurse’s response, yet Elara never truly risks a meaningful loss beyond quiet disappointment. Her insomnia and loneliness could sharpen the cost but mostly remain atmospheric. The conflict thus feels contemplative rather than tense, limiting escalation under even an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the community’s ancestral baking ritual survives or ossifies into loss—is clearly signaled and paid off, and there is a meaningful tightening when Elara realizes the beekeeper-centric story is wrong and chooses to act immediately. Internal and external conflicts align well: historical misinterpretation, communal despair, and the practical need for silver-leaf and heat. However, once Elara speaks to Hemlock, resistance melts almost instantly; there’s little real pushback or price for overturning the community’s belief, keeping escalation on the gentler side. The piece reads as a graceful resolution rather than a truly tested reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can invert the lighthouse’s temporal logic and reframe the hunger stone’s meaning—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely internal/philosophical. The only real pressure beat is the tide at nadir, which signals urgency but never meaningfully complicates her plan; the mechanism works on first try with no resistance, loss, or on-page danger. As a result, escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic, and no option is truly foreclosed beyond the old status quo. The piece is compelling as a lyric experiment, but in terms of conflict and cost it feels relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is focused: advisor vs. fear-entity, with the core battle over revelation rather than brute force. Escalation proceeds through one clear tightening: from searching the mirrors, to spotting foreign movement, to deliberately choosing the least-comforting lie, to forcing the entity to articulate its own weakness. Stakes are primarily existential and thematic, but they do translate into concrete consequences (entity dissolved, curse altered, space transformed). The price paid is subtle—he relinquishes the clasp’s luminance and his role as pure “void”—so while the conflict resolves cleanly, the sense of loss could be sharpened for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the last orchard from a devastating tide—is clear and the storm visibly intensifies, with cirrus signs, gusts, waves, and a looming wall of cloud. Escalation is accumulative, as each dub layers pressure and resonance until the final strike. Yet Leeward never seriously falters, loses ground, or sacrifices anything tangible, so the sense of jeopardy remains somewhat abstract. The conflict resolves gracefully but with less felt price than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—opening the gate to reach the Watchers and seek understanding—is clear from early on, and the pressure coherently builds toward the moment she plays the note. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional: the celestial alignment, the glowing crack, and the rust unfolding give a satisfying tightening and release. The visible cost is her choice to leave the city and walk into potential annihilation, carrying collective hopes. However, the conflict remains relatively smooth and unresisted; no real reversal or near-loss tests her commitment in scene, which keeps the stakes from fully biting at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will expose the truth and thereby unsettle a comforting communal myth—is clear, but almost all opposition is abstract and off-stage. There is minimal escalation: reading the letter and drawing parallels steadily deepen his conviction, yet no new complication or reversal meaningfully tests his resolve. As a result, tension remains low-grade and contemplative rather than tightening toward a pressured decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—rescuing and inscribing fragile memories before oblivion reclaims the pavilion—is clear and quietly affecting. Pressure does tighten once: the metallic clang signals a real constraint, turning his final note into a peak choice under time pressure. However, much of the piece is a rhythm of similar moves (note, seal, reflection) without a strong internal reversal or deepening conflict. The cost is felt but gently rendered, keeping tension more meditative than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the Charter enshrines truth or masks Deep-Singer erasure—is clear and thematically potent, and the key tightening comes with the discovery of the watermark and Deep-Singer sigil, which reweights everything. However, the conflict is largely unilateral: there’s no active counterforce on the page beyond inherited myth, and Elara never seriously considers not pursuing or concealing the truth. Her main “choice” (how to use the stamp) is thoughtful but faces little resistance and carries limited on-page cost, keeping tension more intellectual than visceral. Strong pressure for a quiet story, but not fully maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transmute her grief into something bearable via her craft—is clearly signaled and stays coherent. Pressure deepens primarily when she re-enters the memory of the shadow’s departure during dream recording; that beat is the one clear tightening and works under this story’s quiet, interior lens. However, the conflict remains largely static and unopposed by any external or internal reversal that truly threatens her method or belief. As a result, the emotional cost is felt but the escalation curve is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her grief can be transformed through truly understanding “unused potential”—is clear from early on, and the time-limited experiment tightens that pressure. The key escalation is the successful perturbation and the overwhelming vision of the potential life with Liam, which makes the cost of her quest concrete. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than oppositional; there’s no major reversal, but the intensification of perception and cost satisfies the accumulative lens. It falls just short of higher bands because options don’t meaningfully narrow beyond “see or don’t see,” and her agency isn’t tested against a competing live choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—recovering the chip to awaken the orrery and resolve Kael’s sense of not belonging—are clearly signaled and resolved, with the decisive tightening at the moment the stone is pulled and the chip revealed. However, the external conflict is almost frictionless: the drone finds the spot on its first try, the stone yields with one effort, and there are no genuine setbacks or hard trade-offs. Internal pressure also remains relatively smooth; he feels anticipation and longing, but doesn’t face a real risk of failure or emotional refusal. As a result, the escalation feels more ceremonial than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to live under a lie or pay the cost of truth—is signaled early and tightened when the watch-hand carving collapses his excuses and re-exposes the original betrayal. The main escalation is internal: his self-image as protector is dismantled, forcing a costly new stance to reveal the grandfather’s cowardice. Agency is present in his ritual choice to descend and then in the vow to speak, but there’s limited on-page resistance or competing desire at the moment of decision, so tension plateaus somewhat once the carving appears. The cost is conceptually clear but not yet tested against external pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether this exchange can begin to break a generational cycle of vengeance—is clearly stated but only lightly tested on the page. Pressure increases modestly as the opposing delegation emerges and the prisoners are brought forward, yet there is no real risk, reversal, or complication; the daggers flash and ropes fall without hitch. Elias’s main “choice” is to proceed as planned, so the climax functions more as a ritual consummation than as a crucible that forces trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels static-solemn rather than tightening, leaving the cost mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain in self-punishing exile from his vocation or re-engage with navigation—is clear and tightened effectively when the poles vanish. The escalation from controlled penance to disorientation and emotional breakdown at Widow’s Point works as a true pressure spike. His agency at the peak (choosing to look up, test the compass, and reinterpret “alignment”) clearly resolves the conflict. The cost is mostly internal and skews a bit tidy, with few on-page consequences for choosing to risk trust again beyond the acknowledged scar.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can genuinely reawaken empathy rather than remain a hollow "clean slate"—is clear and deepens as he must interpret increasingly symbolic clues and finally confront memories he’s avoided. The meaningful tightening comes when the journey stops being a puzzle game and becomes a moral-emotional test at the lake, with a clear price in self-condemnation and grief. However, very few moments feel like genuine risk of failure or reversal; obstacles (rockfall, forks) resolve quickly and never truly endanger the goal, so escalation feels muted compared to the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Kael at the risk of erasing her identity—is signaled early and deepens as the ritual’s price clarifies (“required her to surrender the gift that defined her”). Pressure escalates through the metaphysical unspooling and widening of her awareness, tightening from personal loss to a cosmic-scale trade. Her ultimate agency is a renunciation/endurance choice, accepting permanent transformation with no walk-back, which lands as a real cost. The conflict remains primarily internal and smooth, with no sharp reversal, but it does intensify appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconcile her sense of “lost time” and release her postpartum guilt—is clear and consistent. Pressure deepens through the ritual and visions culminating in the act of consecrating, not repairing, the crack, which is a credible crystallization of stance. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with little sense of possible failure or alternate outcomes beyond remaining in despair. The escalation is sufficient for this quiet mode but not maximally sharp in terms of foreclosed options or felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through inner integration rather than force—is clear and builds steadily as she works through progressively broader memories (mother, father, collective). Internal pressure escalates as she confronts deeper layers of grief and isolation, and her near-weightlessness raises a concrete constraint on how the lock may be opened. However, there’s little sense of a genuine alternative path (failure, or a temptation to brute-force or abandon the attempt), so the conflict feels relatively frictionless. The cost is present as emotional vulnerability and the unknown beyond the threshold, but it could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary on-page stake is Elara’s willingness to part with her only remaining treasure in pursuit of inner understanding, with an unknowing secondary stake in the volcano’s threat. Pressure does build from quiet expectation to the act of opening the jars, and the cost (losing her “luminous archive”) is clear. However, the conflict is relatively frictionless—she feels “bittersweet joy” but never seriously entertains holding back, and no opposing force (internal or external) escalates against her goal. The prophecy/volcano dimension sharpens the implied stakes but doesn’t increase the felt pressure on her decision as it happens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—defying the Archivist’s decree to ignite a covert network—is clear, but pressure on that stake rarely tightens in a concrete way. Kael faces no on-page opposition, near-discovery, or serious complication; once the blackout begins, everything proceeds almost flawlessly. Internal tension between obedience and rebellion is mostly assumed rather than dramatized in risky micro-choices. As a result, conflict feels more like a beautifully described operation than an escalating test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully reintroduce friction without catastrophic or unsustainable cost—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively low. Her main opposition is predictive dread (a vision of the stones scattering) rather than a robust external or internal blockade, and the ritual proceeds without significant setback or tactical adjustment. The key turn is successful restoration of a ten-pace circle and realization of finite star dust, which does introduce a long-term cost. Still, the beat-to-beat tension feels contemplative rather than fraught, keeping escalation competent but short of gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant conflict—whether her silenced, traumatized voice can find a new, honest mode of expression—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates with the discovery and opening of the envelope, peaking in the emotional break that forces her to choose between continued paralysis and renewed speech. However, the stakes remain largely internal and contemplative; external consequences of censorship and risk are gestured at rather than felt on the page. The resulting tension is genuine but relatively low-intensity for an elite literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely cerebral and one-sided: Elara versus an intellectual puzzle, with only a brief, low-stakes disruption from the breeze. The dominant stake—decoding the summons to discover its destination—remains relatively low-pressure, with no real threat if she fails or misreads. There is some escalation as successive needle alignments reveal more of the message, but her mastery is never seriously challenged, so tension stays flat. The final “choice” to embrace collaborative unity feels preordained rather than wrestled toward.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s new persona will stay aligned with the resistance—is clear and personalized. Pressure coheres around the approaching molt and tightens when she voices the fear of losing her focus on “stone and mortar,” forcing a stance choice. The resolution is largely conversational and symbolic (reframing and planting a seed) rather than confronting a hard external threat, which keeps escalation modest. Still, the internal conflict and the decision to accept transformation while committing to the rebuild provide a credible, if quiet, narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can defy or renegotiate time’s hold on her grief—is established early and escalates via the risky ritual and the climactic performance in the arbor. The compasses’ guidance and the second piano represent a meaningful tightening toward a single, irrevocable attempt: play the duet and see what, if anything, answers. However, resistance is largely implicit; there’s little sense that the ritual might fail disastrously or that she must trade one real option for another on the page. The emotional cost is felt but the conflict curve stays smooth rather than sharply testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the island’s collective memory before the monsoon—arrives early and stays coherent, with a clear tightening when silence follows the seed-planting and doubt spikes. The decisive turn is protagonist-driven: choosing to trust the dream interpretation and perform the ritual despite her skepticism, then enduring the moment where it appears to have failed. The conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than adversarial, but internal and external (storm, fading memory) pressures are well-braided. The price is largely conceptual/emotional rather than materially dramatized, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can face and transform his regret over the severance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens as he commits to the ritual, endures the painful dock memory, and searches for the “color” within it, which is the main deepening beat. The conflict is primarily internal and contemplative, so tension is more tonal than edge-of-seat; there’s little sense that he might fail or choose avoidance once the ritual begins. Still, the emotional price of revisiting the scene and the earned partial relief at the end give the conflict real, if quiet, consequence.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely internal and contemplative, lacking a moment of high pressure where the protagonist's worldview is genuinely threatened by opposition. The stakes remain abstract ("control meaning") and the resolution comes through passive observation rather than a costly trade-off. The protagonist surrenders his goal without a visceral struggle, making the victory feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.2)
    The immediate, life-threatening stakes (arsonists, pursuers) are dissolved by the narrative's "profound hush," lowering the tension to zero. The conflict shifts to a purely aesthetic decision, ignoring the visceral danger established in the backstory. The resolution feels safe and detached from the physical threat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is virtually no escalation or resistance; Liam enters, Elara waves, he touches the glass, and she heals him instantly. The stated stakes (panic, trauma trigger) are never dramatized as an active obstacle in the scene, as Elara remains perfectly calm and competent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Accumulative pressure works texturally as the shards populate the books, but the external stakes remain low. The conflict with the "salvage" protocol is dismissed too easily, leaving only atmospheric decay as the antagonist and missing a moment of high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is extremely low; the external pressure of sanctions is background noise, while the immediate scene lacks interpersonal or internal friction. Lena’s skepticism is resolved via summary ("softening her skepticism") rather than dramatized struggle, leaving the stakes feeling theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition and the internal friction dissolves immediately upon the application of the magical method. The stakes are stated in exposition ("hollow ache") but are not tested by failure or cost in the scene, resulting in a flat tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story lacks a meaningful escalation of stakes; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma during the ritual, merely surrendering to a process that works instantly. The "cost" of releasing the fragment is theoretical rather than felt, as it immediately yields a purely positive catharsis. Without a moment where failure seems possible or the price of success bites, the dramatic tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    The central conflict evaporates rather than escalates; the opposition (the bulldozer/crew) surrenders immediately upon the vault's opening without negotiation or friction. The puzzle-solving beat lacks agency, as the solution ("keys mirrored Orion’s belt") arrives via a coincidental sunbeam rather than active intellectual struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; there is no external pressure or time constraint forcing a trade-off. The protagonist faces no active opposition—the environment and the device cooperate perfectly—making the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a victory won through agency and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("destiny") and the conflict is resolved by an external tool that immediately aligns the protagonist's wants with the world's message. There is no antagonist or genuine dilemma; the "thorns" are revealed to be helpful without the protagonist having to risk anything to learn that truth.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("safe zones for inquiry") and the central conflict—a cracked vessel—is a minor inconvenience resolved without genuine sacrifice or tactical maneuvering. The protagonist faces no opposing force or internal dilemma that cannot be fixed by a simple shift in perspective, keeping tension low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.3)
    Tension is frequently asserted ("phobia screamed") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or near-failures. The antagonist is defeated by a single trick without a palpable sense of risk or cost to the protagonist, lowering the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a distinct lack of active conflict or stakes. The antagonist is the abstract "endless night," and Elara faces no concrete obstacles—physical or psychological—in her attempt to map it. Because there is no moment where she must trade one value for another, the victory feels inevitable and cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is internal and intellectual, lacking immediate external pressure or risk; the “sanctuary” frame implies safety, removing the cost of failure. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-off or active opposition, making the escalation feel like a scheduled progression rather than a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared abstractly ("trust had grown brittle") but never tested by immediate threat or trade-off. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, leading to an instant, unearned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict remains binary and philosophical, with the antagonist offering no genuine temptation or danger beyond a scoff. The resolution—a supernatural defense by the garden—bypasses the need for a difficult, high-stakes human choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; Kael risks nothing but abstract "doubt" and faces no active opposition or malfunction. The climax is a linear sequence of success without a tightening of options or a moment where failure feels possible, leaving the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes remain low and purely internal, with no active opposition or time pressure forcing a difficult choice. The resolution comes without a demand for sacrifice or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high in the backstory (life and death), but the present-tense conflict is entirely internal and resolved with passive acceptance. There is no active on-page resistance or cost to Elara’s realization; she simply observes the smudge and accepts the lesson. The resolution feels therapeutic rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    The internal stakes—redeeming the grandfather’s legacy—are well-defined and felt. However, the external pressure is low; the tunnel offers atmosphere but no active opposition, making the climax a quiet confirmation rather than a high-pressure test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is a near-total absence of tension or conflict; the protagonist explicitly observes "without sorrow or praise," neutralizing any potential emotional stakes. No options are narrowed, and no price is paid; the "tremor" signals a change in routine, not a crisis or meaningful test.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared but never tested against genuine opposition; Liam yields to the therapy immediately without a meaningful refusal or failure. The absence of an escalating obstacle robs the climax of tension, creating a flat trajectory of inevitable success.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and retrospective, centered on a past character's struggle (Elara) rather than the protagonist's present risk. The historian faces no immediate opposition or hard choices, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension evaporates at the climax; Elara arrives already convinced, removing any need for Silas to navigate a difficult choice or face rejection in the moment. The "accidentally prophetic" nature of the message acts as a deus ex machina that resolves the central conflict off-stage, lowering the stakes of the actual encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes of "dimensional unraveling" are high in concept, the on-page conflict is low-pressure; the opposition folds instantly upon hearing the truth. The story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal, resulting in a linear path to victory without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and internal, with the threat of "exhaustion" stated but not dramatized through consequence or impaired judgment. The protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma; she simply completes her task as planned. The lack of a difficult trade-off leaves the narrative tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared ("periodically eternal attribute" vs. freedom), but the conflict is navigated through a linear sequence of emotional checkpoints. The lack of external pressure—due to the frozen timeframe—keeps the struggle internal and abstract, resolving too smoothly via the "Compassion" rune.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is an internal state of "numbness" that dissolves immediately upon contact with Kael's method. There is no escalation of stakes or moment of doubt where Elara must commit to the process at a personal price; the solution works perfectly on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the tension dissolves rapidly into "purposeful stillness" once Elara decides to act. The brevity limits the escalation; the protagonist overcomes the threat with relative ease and little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain low as the conflict is strictly internal and resolves instantly upon the release of the scent. The protagonist faces no significant trade-off or obstacle; the "cost" is a brief moment of catharsis that leads immediately to total certainty, lacking lingering weight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "impossible choice" is declared but not enacted; the protagonist faces no actual trade-off, as the "third path" allows him to succeed without sacrifice. The stakes dissolve because the pressure is relieved by a convenient external reaction (the grotto glowing) rather than a costly decision, rendering the conflict toothless.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (breaking the silence) is clear, and the decision to abandon the heirloom bowl provides a tangible cost to the resolution. The conflict remains largely atmospheric and internal, lacking urgent external pressure, but the escalation through the musical ritual works for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined between professional safety and human vulnerability, driving the narrative tension. The cost of the choice is immediate and felt through the "raw ache" and loss of detachment, satisfying the requirement for meaningful consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain low throughout; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle to the goal of honoring the stagehand. The "rebellion" consists of writing a kindly note, which encounters no opposition and extracts no price from the protagonist, failing to generate the requisite narrative pressure for a 600-800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("belonging") but never tested against resistance; Kael accepts Elara immediately, and the environment yields the prize without struggle. There is no meaningful tightening of options; the protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or actual risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Situational pressure is maintained by the ticking clock of the giant waking, creating urgency. While the stakes are elevated to "mending the world's soul," the resolution is achieved solely through skill, lacking a difficult trade-off or sacrifice to heighten the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.6)
    External pressure is negligible; the ritual works on the first attempt without resistance, failure, or unintended consequences. The stakes are purely internal and are resolved by a "gift" from the magic system, lacking the friction or tightening required for a compelling narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure is minimal; the city's flickering lights provide texture but do not act as a ticking clock or constraint. The dominant stake (visibility) is resolved without a moment of genuine doubt or danger, as the antagonist (the librarian) accepts the intruder instantly, mitigating the felt cost of the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no pushback from nature, customers, or her own habits after the initial realization. The stakes (control vs. flow) are resolved through a montage of success rather than a pressure-filled choice with visible cost, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (peace vs. trauma) is clear, but the escalation lacks friction; the environment and the antagonist (Elara/the past) yield immediately to the protagonist's desires. The climax is a polite exchange without a felt moment of doubt or difficult trade-off, lowering the earned value of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are abstract ("communal resilience") and removed from the immediate scene, lowering the felt pressure. The conflict is primarily internal but is resolved too tidily by the protagonist simply choosing to "abandon futile attempts," which dissolves the antagonist (anxiety) without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; the community accepts her "cure" immediately with "tears" and "renewed purpose." The stakes are high in concept (healing trauma) but low in execution, as the solution works without failure, pushback, or visible personal cost to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is almost entirely internal and resolved relatively easily by the introduction of the magical prop, lacking strong opposing pressure or escalating obstacles. The "dare" serves as a functional climax, but the resistance leading up to it is brief and lacks the friction of a difficult, high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the magic tile functions perfectly without exacting a price or forcing a difficult trade-off from Elara. The "cost" of putting aside skepticism is nominal and paid instantly, leaving the stakes feeling low despite the emotional subject matter. The narrative lacks a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; Kaelen faces no antagonist, time limit, or dilemma that forces a trade-off. The escalation is external and coincidental (the storm happens to him), and he succeeds without sacrifice, resulting in a flat trajectory devoid of genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is dampened by the reflection-heavy mode; the conflict is resolved via an internal epiphany ("integration") rather than external pressure or costly action. The "waiting actively" method is redefined as "absorbing," effectively bypassing the constraint of waiting and reducing the felt difficulty of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are abstract and internal (memory vs. oblivion) with no immediate pressure forcing a difficult trade-off or active choice. The conflict is low-voltage; the sunrise brings resolution by default rather than through protagonist agency or endurance against active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are abstract and low; the conflict is strictly philosophical (memory vs. erasure) with no external pressure or risk of failure. The protagonist faces no opposition, and the climax—interpreting the label—resolves instantly without testing his commitment or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.6)
    External and internal resistance are minimal; Elara solves the riddle on the first attempt by following instructions, facing no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. The potential conflict between her scientific "myth buster" persona and the mystical nature of the riddle is unresolved and undramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("erasure") but the on-page pressure is low due to the lack of an active antagonist or obstacle. The conflict dissolves immediately upon the execution of the protagonist's idea, with the community's instant compliance removing necessary tension or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are sentimental and retrospective; the mining threat is an off-screen inevitability rather than an active pressure in the scene. The primary conflict (cold/endurance) is resolved via summary ("He had outlasted...") rather than tested through a difficult choice or near-failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    While external urgency is stated via the bell and the ship's departure, the protagonist's "magnetic calm" effectively neutralizes all tension. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, nor is there a price paid for success; the conflict is declared but not dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there are no obstacles, antagonists, or internal doubts hindering Elara's progress. The "worrying tranquility" is stated as a mood but does not exert pressure or force a trade-off. The narrative follows a flat line of observation-realization-decision without the escalation or tightening of options required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is minimal; the "looming collapse" is an abstract threat that never actively opposes the protagonist's progress. Elara faces no hard trade-offs or moments of genuine jeopardy; the warning that "haste would shatter" the resonance is a constraint she meets effortlessly. The stakes are declared but never tested by a significant on-page obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is tightly constructed around a constraint: the need for slowness battling the urgent oxygen clock. This creates inherent, escalating pressure that forces the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is minimal; Elias offers only token skepticism before immediately capitulating. The stakes are declared ("justice," "truth") but the obstacle is overcome without a meaningful escalation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist faces no active resistance or difficult choices; success is immediate upon using the bead. The constraints mentioned ("fragile essence") do not force a trade-off or jeopardize the outcome in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the task, or herself. The "ruin" is static, and the sewing process proceeds without error or obstacle, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the environment cooperates ("birds hushed") and the resolution comes without significant on-page cost or obstacle. The conflict is internal but resolved through smooth realizations rather than tested commitment or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are low and purely aesthetic; the urgency is stated ("Today’s task was urgent") but not felt through escalating pressure or consequences. The conflict is internal and mild, resolved instantly by an external epiphany, lacking a deepening of the dilemma or a forced sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared ("fate of the kingdom") but not felt, as the antagonist offers no on-page resistance beyond a dismissal. The resolution—stitching a corrected chart—is a montage of labor that lacks immediate pressure or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are clear, but the central conflict is resolved by the medium's intervention and the shard's revelation, leaving the protagonist passive in the climax. There is no escalation of agency where Kael must trade something of value to achieve his peace.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and retrospective, with the central conflict (a memory of a refugee camp) offering no active resistance in the present scene. There is no escalation of risk or narrowing of options; the resolution is achieved without struggle, as the "antagonist" is merely the silence of a sleeping child.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no external opposition, time pressure, or internal obstacle that threatens the ritual's success. The narrative lacks escalation, as Elara's plan proceeds without a hitch or a moment of doubt that would force a hard choice. The "climax" is a smooth aesthetic experience rather than a pressure-tested confrontation of values.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) acts as a philosophical preference rather than a high-stakes conflict. The "cost" of giving up certainty is framed as a relief ("heavy cloak... wind lifting it") rather than a genuine price paid, undercutting the dramatic tension of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful on-page escalation; the characters remain in a "sanctuary" where the threat is reduced to distant "whispers of patrols." The climax is atmospheric rather than the result of a pressurized decision or forced trade-off. The protagonist faces no immediate obstacle that tests his resolve or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation or rising pressure; the poet's routine remains static for centuries until the ending happens spontaneously. The dominant stake (insomnia/longing) faces no new test or complication on the page. The resolution comes without visible cost or sacrifice, lacking the "felt price" required for narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict or opposition; the "indifference of time" is abstract and does not manifest as a concrete obstacle in the scene. The protagonist faces no resistance, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no price for her success.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is linear and lacks resistance; Elara attempts the task and succeeds immediately without setback or adaptation. The stakes (council meeting) are declared but generate no immediate on-page pressure. The resolution involves no sacrifice or trade-off; the "perfect sentence" simply fixes the relationship instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.0)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist encounters a problem, immediately finds a hidden instruction that solves it perfectly, and implements it without resistance. There is no moment where options narrow or a price must be paid, stripping the narrative of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—the preservation of his safe new identity versus the pain of honest memory—is clear and escalated by the visceral memory of the bird. The cost of his final decision is legible: he trades safety for the vulnerability of connection (Clara). The pressure remains coherent under an internal/situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely intellectual and emotional without an opposing force or time pressure to test the protagonist's conviction. The escalation is nonexistent; the character simply remembers details until the answer arrives. There is no moment where she risks being wrong or pays a visible price for her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no external pressure or time constraint forcing a tangible trade-off. The resolution arrives without cost or risk, rendering the "climax" merely observational rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are established early but remain abstract; the protagonist faces no active opposition or rising cost, merely a series of successful tests. The escalation is linear repetition (test one, test two, test three) rather than a tightening of options or increased risk, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent as the protagonist's control over the environment goes unchallenged and the target audience (the stranger) arrives precisely on cue. The stakes remain theoretical because the plan faces no resistance, and the resolution requires no sacrifice or adaptation from Corbin.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is minimal; the antagonist ("nostalgia ban") exists only in backstory and applies no immediate pressure to the ritual itself. Kael is a passive recipient, and Elara faces no obstacles or difficult trade-offs, resulting in a scene that feels like a demonstration rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no active stakes or opposition; the environment "holds its breath" and offers a "sanctuary" rather than pressure. The "gentle rebellion" mentioned is thematic, not dramatized through confrontation or difficult choice. Without an obstacle or a risk of failure, the narrative lacks the escalation required to drive a story arc.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is a lack of genuine conflict or stakes; the protagonist poses a philosophical question and immediately answers it to his satisfaction. No external force opposes him, and his internal debate is resolved without sacrifice or trade-off. The "escalation" is merely a rhetorical piling of metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is abstract (apathy) and dissolves instantly upon contact with the protagonist's intervention. There is no escalation, no risk of failure, and the protagonist pays no price, resulting in a flat tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    The conflict is low-pressure and contemplative, lacking a palpable antagonist or obstacle to the protagonist's goal. The "urgent resonance" removes the need for search or struggle, and the "escalation" is merely the discovery of a second object rather than a tightening of options or rising danger.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the mirrors offer "resistance" that is immediately overcome by singing, lacking any back-and-forth struggle or tactical adaptation. The "fading heartbeat" creates a ticking clock, but since the protagonist accepts this cost without hesitation, the dramatic tension is low. The victory feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict is focused, but the opposition folds too easily in response to a single speech; the elder's transition from spitting to signing lacks sufficient on-page resistance. The cost of resignation is stated clearly but feels more noble than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined; the "cost" of surrendering the egg is palpable and meaningful on the page. While the pressure is largely internal, the physical act of release provides a satisfying crystallization of his choice to prioritize memory over possession.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is present but lacks visceral stakes; the "suffocating lullaby" and "central knot" are overcome with "fluid grace" and "gentle motion," minimizing the sense of risk. The protagonist's competence is so absolute that the opposing pressure feels abstract rather than immediate and threatening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract and retrospective, centered on an intellectual debate about storytelling ethics rather than an immediate, tangible risk. The "conflict" is resolved through compliant contemplation; there is no active opposition in the scene to force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict between the vow to the forgotten and the immediate need of the celebrated is executed well. The cost is tangible and paid on the page—she sacrifices the unique archive object to save the transient visitor, satisfying the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.3)
    Tension is minimal as the environment and task offer no active resistance. The narrative skips over potential struggle ("Time dissolved"), and the "snowmelt ardor" motivation acts as a constant fuel rather than a variable under pressure. The stakes remain abstract (sound vs. silence) without immediate physical or psychological jeopardy in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stakes are undercut by the lack of opposition; the "threat" of the storm serves only as a timer, and the resolution provides total healing without a visible price. The protagonist trades a decaying paper for transcendence, a transaction that feels devoid of sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared ("covenant with the unknown") but never tested by opposition; Enlil faces no external threat or internal doubt that risks failure. The "interregnum" acts as wallpaper rather than a ticking clock or pressure cooker, leaving the narrative without meaningful escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is minimal; Kael’s decades of bitterness crumble immediately under Elara’s first intervention, offering no genuine opposition to the protagonist’s goal. The external "shifting reality" provides atmospheric flavor but does not exert causal pressure on the scene’s central choice. The stakes are declared ("soul," "resentment") but never tested, as success is immediate and painless.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "runaway dream" is described as "hesitant, curious" rather than elusive or dangerous, and the environment aids the protagonist. There is no antagonist or significant obstacle to force a difficult choice. The narrative relies on a passive "ticking clock" (twilight) that never truly threatens the outcome, resulting in flat escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stakes are internal and reflective, lacking external pressure or genuine risk of failure. The conflict resolves almost instantly upon Lyra's arrival through a mutual agreement on the theme, missing the opportunity for a "decisive change" or felt cost. The escalation is soft, driven by memory rather than urgent agency.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake is intellectual (solving the puzzle), and the resolution comes without a visible or felt cost. Elara gains everything (knowledge, home) and loses nothing; her "bewilderment" simply evaporates. The escalation is mild, and the obstacle is overcome by a single moment of reflection rather than a forced trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central conflict with the Warden resolves too easily through a thematic speech; the "cost" of admitting fear is paid in a single line without significant prior pressure or resistance. The stakes are declared ("dissolution") but the obstacle offers little genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is effectively generated by the decay of memory, creating a ticking clock that forces Lyra to act. The final choice to release the card carries a clear, felt cost—the loss of her physical link to Kael—satisfying the requirement for a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout; Elara enters with "calm purpose" and faces no antagonist, time limit, or risk of failure during the ritual. The "chaos" is described but not felt as an immediate pressure, resulting in a low-tension procedural beat. The climax lacks escalation, as the solution works exactly as intended without forcing the protagonist to adapt or endure a new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "weaponized storm" submits instantly to Kael's internal shift of intent ("pouring every memory of peace"), lacking a sequence of escalation or distinct counter-pressure. The resolution comes without a tangible on-page cost beyond a single tear, making the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the opposition (survivor camps) is off-page and the immediate pressure is only the passage of time. The protagonist faces no active resistance or difficult trade-offs; the alignment occurs and the device works perfectly on the first try. Without a moment where failure seems plausible or a price is paid, escalation remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.0)
    External pressure is minimal; the antagonist is a passive fog that immediately submits to the protagonist's will once she chooses to write. There is no tangible risk of failure, time pressure, or alternative cost to her actions; the tension dissipates the moment she has her epiphany. The stakes remain abstract and theoretical ("sculpt identity") rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is largely atmospheric and thematic rather than dramatic; the "starless void" is a passive obstacle easily overcome by a single tool. There is no moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt, resulting in a flat pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict is abstract ("difficult conversation" about an unnamed topic), making the stakes feel theoretical. The resolution—a shared look at a crab leading to immediate reconciliation—lacks a visible cost paid on the page; the "seismic shift" is asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are internal but lack sufficient pressure; the "xenial" nature of the setting means the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The climax (claustrophobia dissolving "like mist") happens to her rather than being seized through agency, and the resolution comes without a visible cost or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.0)
    The conflict is low-pressure and internal but lacks sufficient dramatized resistance; Leo’s tension dissolves almost immediately upon instruction. There is no meaningful tightening or escalation of stakes; the "transformation" feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is strictly procedural (peeling paint against a clock) and lacks interpersonal or internal pressure. The climax resolves via sudden knowledge acquisition rather than a high-stakes decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; the antagonistic force (despair) capitulates immediately to the protagonist's guidance without complicating the effort. The lack of pushback or failure during the climax robs the victory of weight.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("meaning," "quantum promise") but never tested by failure or opposition; the "glitchy texts" act as cheerleaders rather than complications. The protagonist volunteers and succeeds instantly, creating a flat trajectory devoid of the escalation or tightening options required for dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of active opposition or pressure; the "hidden truth" is uncovered on the first attempt with no cost or complication. The stakes are declared ("dynasty ender") but never tested; the "weight of generations" lifts simply because she reads a note, making the victory feel unearned and devoid of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely conceptual; while the "shape of possibility" is the goal, failure does not carry a visceral threat. The conflict is resolved smoothly through surrender, and the "cost" described ("drawing a breath held thirty years") reads as relief rather than a price paid, lowering the sense of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or significant internal reluctance before the discovery resolves her distress. The stakes—emotional healing—are declared but not tested by a hard choice or potential failure. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of screws; success is immediate upon opening the box.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes (erasing history) and pressure (approaching enforcers) are clear and functional. However, the conflict remains external and somewhat generic; the protagonist's internal struggle is resolved too easily with "unshakable peace," missing the opportunity for a costlier, more ambivalent emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are abstract ("valley's peace") and the antagonist ("wind-chime and ice") presents no concrete threat or difficult trade-off. The resolution is achieved through competence alone, lacking a visible price paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("prayer against oblivion") and face no immediate threat or opposition in the scene. The "conflict" is merely the wait for a leaf, and the resolution comes without risk, trade-off, or meaningful escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are low; the physical obstacles (vines, a stuck needle) are overcome instantly with minimal effort or failure. The protagonist faces no significant trade-offs or escalating pressure, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active opposition or risk; the ritual proceeds smoothly with only a mention of "pushing limits" rather than demonstrated struggle. The initial tension of the "search party" and the missing apprentice is immediately abandoned for a reflective exercise that faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.2)
    Opposition is minimal; Cora yields quickly to Elara's methods, and the conflict remains abstract (despair vs. joy) without escalating stakes. There is no moment where Elara’s success is in doubt or where she must pay a meaningful price, resulting in a low-tension narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain entirely internal; the physical pressures (gust, vine) are negligible and serve only as prompts for introspection. The narrative lacks genuine risk or failure, resolving the central conflict through smooth intellectual synthesis without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks meaningful opposition or escalation; Elara faces no obstacles in interpreting the paintings or accessing the history. Cora is a helpful guide, and the "hidden details" are found instantly via intuition. Without a moment of doubt, failure, or trade-off, the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes remain low and largely theoretical; Leo faces no genuine threat, failure state, or difficult choice. The conflict is resolved through compliant cooperation from the ghost and easy retrieval of the object, lacking the escalation or pressure required to make the final vow feel like a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely conceptual ("reality," "eternity") and the "dangerous attribute" of destabilization resolves without exacting a visible price from the protagonist. The opposition is abstract entropy, and the lack of a tangible failure condition makes the success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is negligible; the antagonist provides no effective resistance in the scene, folding immediately upon witnessing the projection. The "temporal storm" serves as a convenient battery for the solution rather than a source of genuine, complicating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high but abstract ("stolen dawn"), and the conflict is purely somatic (enduring the "wilt"). The escalation relies on physical pain tolerance rather than tactical maneuvering or moral dilemmas, resulting in a binary succeed/fail dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    The internal conflict (seeking explanation vs. accepting awe) is clear but resolved too easily by the external vision, lacking a moment of high-pressure oscillation. The cost of the final choice—leaving without a sample—is stated but feels emotionally light given the brevity of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are deflated immediately when the protagonist reinterprets the threat as an "invitation," removing the tension of survival. The conflict is purely internal and abstract, resolved through a "reverie" rather than a confrontation with high-stakes consequences or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake is intellectual curiosity, lacking urgent pressure, opposition, or consequence for failure. The narrative contains no meaningful tightening of options; the protagonist simply waits for a scheduled event (dawn) to provide the answer. There is no visible or felt cost paid to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The flashback sequence generates effective situational pressure with the approaching patrol, but the frame narrative lacks tension. Elias is physically safe in the zeppelin, and his intervention—a mental push—costs him nothing but a brief moment of emotional intensity, limiting the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are clear but the pressure is low; the conflict is resolved through steady contemplation rather than active struggle or external resistance. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening or reversal that would force a harder tradeoff before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are largely theoretical; the conflict is an internal realization with no external pressure or time constraint to force a difficult choice. The resolution comes through a lucky coincidence (the accidental recording) rather than the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; there is no active opposition or possibility of failure during the ritual. The environment offers mild resistance (cold/numbness), but Elara overcomes it without tactical adjustment or sacrifice. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.9)
    Tension is undercut by the protagonist's absolute confidence in the weather data; the reader never truly fears the "cataclysm," making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral. The conflict remains internal and intellectual, lacking external pressure or a moment of genuine risk where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or active resistance; the protagonist wants to find peace and immediately finds it without obstacle. The "impossible brilliance" of the meteor provides visual escalation but does not raise the stakes or force a trade-off (e.g., watching the star vs. performing his duty). Without a moment where the protagonist could fail or must pay a price, the "strength" mentioned in the text remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is almost entirely retrospective (Elias's past regrets) or abstract (the "weight" of silence). There is minimal present-tense pressure or obstacle for the recluse; the vigil appears effortless and serene. Without an escalation of difficulty or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the stakes remain low.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; while there is a deadline (borrowed time), there is no antagonist or genuine dilemma that forces a hard choice. The resolution is an unopposed action, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or reversal needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is effectively non-existent; the &quot;discord&quot; of the snapped kite is immediately accepted and reframed as beauty without resistance. There is no escalation of stakes, only a serene progression from observation to philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the task proceeds with convenient ease (squirrels help, stone sings back) and no significant opposition. The "man vs. mortality" conflict dissolves immediately into acceptance, removing tension from the six-month timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "ideological war" is mentioned in backstory but vanishes the moment the characters meet, as Elias has already capitulated. There is no on-page struggle, trade-off, or tightening of stakes; the protagonist achieves her goal without facing opposition or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, dilemma, or risk of failure, merely following external instructions to a guaranteed success with no visible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low; the external force (Anya) vanishes immediately, and the internal conflict is resolved by a convenient epiphany. The cost of abandoning his hard-won retirement is stated conceptually but lacks visceral weight in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; Elara faces no active opposition, time constraint, or risk of failure in the scene. The conflict is purely internal and resolves via a fortuitous external event (the glimpse) rather than a high-stakes decision. The ending reconfigures her mindset, but the lack of an on-page price for this knowledge limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is minimal because the protagonist faces no active opposition; the "groaning" spire is atmospheric rather than obstructive. There is no escalation of stakes through difficult choices; the character arrives fully prepared and succeeds without sacrificing resources or altering tactics. The "cost" is purely descriptive ("tears froze") rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.4)
    Escalation is present via the Accumulative lens (words gather, crowd gathers, light builds), but the dominant stake—preserving memory—faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The internal conflict ("forbade her to linger") provides minor friction, but the "unbinding" proceeds with "deliberate grace," making the outcome feel inevitable rather than struggled for.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (overcoming grief) is clear, but the escalation is minimal; the obstacle is resolved almost immediately upon finding the stone and feather. The cost is described ("pain surged, sharp as shattered glass") but passed over too quickly to feel like a genuine barrier or sacrifice. The conflict lacks a moment of doubt or meaningful trade-off before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely static and internal; Kael faces a puzzle that offers no active resistance, time pressure, or evolving stakes. The absence of an antagonist or a ticking clock (the "distant thunder" is metaphorical) means the tension relies entirely on his internal state, which resolves too easily through simple observation. The climax lacks a sense of risk or sacrifice, as the solution presents itself without demanding a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.5)
    Opposition is token; Elder Borin's resistance evaporates after a single counter-argument, removing all stakes. There is no escalation or back-and-forth struggle, making the "impending ritual" feel like a low-risk event.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (legacy vs. oblivion), but the escalation is linear; once the ritual begins, there is no significant obstacle or doubt. The conflict is resolved through a steady progression of successes rather than a struggle against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is low; the environment serendipitously aids the protagonist via the fall rather than forcing a difficult choice. The resolution is an internal conceptual shift without a visible, felt price paid on the page—he simply completes the errand he set out to do.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent on the page; the "opposition" (Silas/foghorn) is theoretical and capitulates instantly upon the protagonist's first action. There is no escalation, tightening of options, or trade-off; the stakes dissolve into immediate agreement, failing to test the protagonist's conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist follows instructions without facing significant setbacks or making difficult trade-offs. The emotional resolution ("peace settled") bypasses the struggle of grief, resolving the central tension with magical ease.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are high in theory (sister's sanity) but low in the scene; the storm is an "aftermath" and the harvest is uncontested, lacking a moment where failure becomes a tangible risk. The conflict relies entirely on off-page threats (the virus, the guard) rather than present-tense escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is internal and low-pressure; the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-off, merely a contemplative puzzle he solves instantly. The lack of visible cost or resistance makes the "tightening" feel inevitable rather than earned, as the realization arrives without genuine obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the rising creek creates physical urgency, the central "decision" is merely navigational (follow the ants) rather than moral or personal. The resolution dissipates pressure through realization rather than forcing a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (fading light) is signaled early, but the escalation lacks gritty, active opposition; the climb and confrontation proceed without significant setbacks. The resolution is clean but feels low-cost, as the epiphany arrives immediately upon request without forcing a painful trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition from the environment, the subjects, or her own limitations. The "revaluation" is a gift bestowed smoothly, devoid of the friction or trade-offs necessary to generate narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.0)
    The conflict is internal and abstract; the "terror" is stated but dissolves too easily without a hard choice or trade-off. The resolution lacks a visible price, relying on a comforting epiphany that arrives without the requisite struggle to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the stake is conceptual (the potential birth) rather than an immediate, high-pressure obstacle in the repair process itself. The repair proceeds with only "soft resistance" and a "quiet click," lacking a moment of genuine doubt, trade-off, or failure that would spike tension. The escalation is internal and abstract ("pouring intention") rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is internal but lacks visceral stakes; the obstacle (ink crystallizing) is resolved almost immediately by a single memory. The "cost" of reliving the trauma is stated ("pain, shame") but processed and discarded in a single sentence, reducing the sense of genuine risk or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is significantly underpowered; the spirit offers no resistance to the apology, granting forgiveness immediately upon appearance. The external stakes (trees falling) are established, but the interpersonal stakes deflate because the reconciliation is devoid of struggle or negotiated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are conceptually absolute (existence vs. void) but lack visceral tension, as Elara's success feels inevitable from the start. The "muddy grey" of hope and despair is unified too easily by "yearning" (line 22), bypassing potential conflict for a smooth thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are internal and philosophical, which fits the tone, though the external conflict is minimal. The escalation during the countdown—where the sun physically halts and the body strains—effectively heightens the pressure. The cost is paid in physical strain ("eyes watering," "calloused fingertip") and the weight of decades of obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is minimal conflict; the security barrier offers no resistance to the laser, and the internal grief is resolved via a single conversation. The stakes ("revolutionize intrusion detection") are declared but not felt, as the "revolution" is essentially a philosophical reframe involving no trade-offs, risk, or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or conflict; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or difficult trade-off. Success is immediate upon reaching the location, and the "stakes" remain abstract concepts ("seeking understanding") that are never threatened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal and resolves immediately upon the protagonist's intervention; the caller offers no emotional resistance to the complex metaphor, stripping the scene of necessary dramatic tension and tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared ("sacred motivation") but never tested; the environment and memory cooperate fully with the protagonist's desires. The climax lacks tension, as the "regeneration" is achieved through a smooth, unopposed act of writing, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than an earned victory against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist scoffs at the rock's power but hands it over immediately upon the stranger's arrival. The stakes (loneliness vs. connection) are resolved without friction or sacrifice, resulting in a climax that lacks tension or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.2)
    There are no stakes on the page beyond the stated goal; the environment offers "thorns vibrating with dissonant caution" which she simply walks around. The "pause of shifting constellations" suggests a time constraint, but it generates no pressure or urgency in the prose. The protagonist faces no external opposition and no internal resistance to the healing process.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are deeply internal, centering on the processing of past guilt. While valid, the on-page escalation is mild; the conflict is resolved through a shift in perspective triggered by a relatively low-cost physical action (unbending the nib). The "meaningful tightening" is present but lacks visceral, immediate consequences beyond the psychological relief.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("town’s forgotten... advisor") but never tested under pressure; the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-off. The transition from isolation to connection is frictionless, lacking the escalation or tightening required to make the emotional payoff feel earned or significant.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are stated clearly, but the immediate on-page pressure is low; the "obstacle" of the vandalized statue is resolved almost immediately via intuition. The conflict is primarily internal but articulated through summary rather than dramatic friction, making the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clear but lack active opposition or escalation; the antagonist is the abstract force of entropy ("silence and science") rather than a concrete pressure narrowing options in the moment. The ritual succeeds without a moment of doubt or a forced trade-off, resulting in a low-tension arc where the cost is theoretical (fading dreams) rather than an acute price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; Kael faces no obstacles, doubts, or physical resistance, and his success is never in question. The "stakes" are purely philosophical—proving a point—and are resolved instantly by his competence. The lack of an antagonist or environmental pushback leaves the narrative tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is internal but abstract, lacking defined stakes or visible cost; Elara's "private weight" is never tested or made concrete. The resolution comes without sacrifice or significant effort from the protagonist (Kael faces no obstacle; Elara makes no choice), resulting in a low-pressure vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "rebellion" faces no active opposition from the "rigid" town, and the shopkeepers agree immediately. Without the risk of failure or a moment of genuine resistance, the victory feels unearned and the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks escalating pressure or genuine opposition; Elara wants the island, goes there, and gets it with minimal resistance. The internal conflict is resolved through surrender rather than a difficult trade-off, making the stakes feel abstract and the victory inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.6)
    The internal conflict (grief vs. performance) is coherent, and the backstory of the Happiness Mandate provides effective contextual pressure. However, the immediate stakes are relatively low—mostly emotional maintenance—and the "cost" of the ritual (a prick of blood, a tear) feels slightly clichéd and symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the environment welcomes the protagonist, and the "boundary" dissolves on the first attempt without complication or sacrifice. There is no escalation of pressure, no narrowing of options, and no antagonist force (internal or external), leading to a narrative devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist meets almost no resistance. Kael offers a token refusal ("A broken reed offers only silence") before immediately acquiescing, resulting in a static conflict loop that resolves via "symmetric satisfaction" rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("texture of connection") and the conflict is purely ideological, played out against a passive opponent. The victory is achieved without sacrifice or risk; Elara simply proves Aris wrong, and he immediately accepts it.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are internal and clearly signaled, but the escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off in the scene. The "cost" of the transformation is low, as the climax provides a healing answer without demanding a significant price from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Leo’s arrival offers an opportunity for exposition rather than a test of Elara’s goals or resources. The scene lacks escalation, as the "problem" is resolved through a teaching moment without risk, trade-off, or meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are high but abstract ("repeating a collapse"). The escalation is linear—a series of memory challenges—and the protagonist overcomes them with high competence and minimal doubt. The cost is described ("sweat," "tears," "innocence fractured") but feels more like a required toll than a price that genuinely endangers the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is minimal because the external threat (the shadow) is revealed to be a helper with no resistance, removing the need for a difficult trade-off. The stakes remain conceptual ("preserving the shape of hope") and the resolution comes through easy understanding rather than a choice with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is purely internal and resolved without visible cost; the protagonist effectively talks herself out of her distress in a linear fashion. There is no active antagonism or escalation in the present moment, only the processing of a past event.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; the central conflict (the drive to open wounds vs. the need for peace) encounters no active resistance before the telepathy resolves it. There is no escalation of pressure, only a linear, low-stakes progression to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the film yields its secrets immediately, and the environment offers no resistance. The stakes remain intellectual and abstract, with no visible cost or consequence for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal block, or failure state once the ritual begins. The resolution ("Rest") is a relief rather than a cost, meaning the narrative lacks the tightening pressure or trade-offs necessary for dramatic conflict. The "shadowed rapture" is achieved without struggle, rendering the catharsis unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.1)
    There is almost no conflict; the protagonist performs a ritual that succeeds immediately with only "hesitant" resistance from the spark itself. The "void" is a passive state, not an active opposition, and the protagonist's "necessary emptiness" is a pre-existing condition, not a price paid in the moment. The lack of escalation or risk flattens the narrative arc significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.0)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; Kael encounters no antagonism, time constraints, or failure risks. The conflict is purely abstract (silence/fragmentation) and resolves instantly upon completing the task, lacking the escalation or difficult trade-offs required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pressure is minimal throughout; the central conflict ("unused courage") is internal but lacks external manifestation or opposition. The protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure, as the guides ensure her success at every step, and the resolution comes without any visible sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from internal guilt to an external breach of protocol. The tension between the safety of the fortress and the integrity of truth is palpable. The final choice to leave the door open and display the bolt represents a meaningful foreclosure of her previous safety.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is almost no immediate, on-page pressure; Kael works in "silent reverence" and safety while the actual conflict happens off-stage or in the past. The stakes are theoretically high (a kingdom), but because Kael faces no direct opposition or dilemma in the library, the tension remains flat. The climax is resolved by a secondary character in a different location, stripping the protagonist of urgent agency.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no escalation; the character faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a trade-off. The climax is a passive receipt of information that resolves the internal tension without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pressure is entirely internal and resolved by a convenient external force (the stones' hum) rather than protagonist struggle. The stakes are declared ("reignite the rebellion") but the scene lacks an active opposing force or a tangible trade-off to test Kael's resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; Elara faces no genuine opposition, resource scarcity, or possibility of failure. The central conflict—violating a sacred seal—is resolved instantly by environmental validation, stripping the climax of tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the external trigger (gull cry) is immediately neutralized by the protagonist's internal technique, removing all tension. There is no escalation, dilemma, or trade-off; the stakes remain abstract concepts rather than felt risks.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is largely theoretical ("coherence unraveling") and resolved without significant opposition or failure. The protagonist faces no meaningful setbacks; he descends, immediately understands the solution, and executes it without paying a visible price. The stakes are declared but not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the "serene" nature of the anger removes urgency from the investigation. The cost—the loss of the drone—is accepted immediately with a "faint smile" and "no frustration," stripping the climax of dramatic tension or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared but not tested with a visible price; Elara risks everything but pays nothing on the page. The external obstacle (Kael) is bypassed too easily to generate high-stakes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is virtually no on-page conflict or pressure; the antagonist is a memory and the environment presents no immediate obstacle. The stakes are theoretical ("weaving continuity") rather than a concrete problem that forces Elara to trade one value for another in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are established early, and the escalation of the garden's chaos provides coherent pressure. However, the resolution hinges on an internal release of emotion that feels slightly unearned by the external struggle, and the cost—giving up the "catch" for internal peace—is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are internal but legible: the choice between preserving a dignified lie or revealing a painful truth. The escalation through the three "contradictions" provides good structural pressure, leading to a felt conceptual cost at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the "haunted firmware" presents a situation but offers no active opposition or counter-move to the protagonist's efforts. The central struggle is retrospective (a memory of guilt) and resolves instantly upon the character's decision to act.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("pervasive unease," "unlearning") and the conflict offers no tangible resistance. The climax is resolved by a single gesture that works instantly, lacking a visible trade-off or cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the opposition (muttering elders) is summarized and dismissed without exerting on-page pressure. There is no escalation of conflict; the protagonist arrives, performs the intended action without obstacle, and achieves total resolution, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are abstract ("oblivion") and the protagonist meets no meaningful opposition; the ritual simply works as intended. There is no escalation of pressure or "meaningful tightening" of options; the transition from longing to acceptance is smooth and inevitable, lacking felt cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The external stakes are clear, but the internal conflict lacks significant resistance; the somatic method works perfectly on the first attempt without forcing Elara to make a difficult trade-off or overcome failure. The victory feels inevitable rather than earned through escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or internal doubt to force a tightening of options. The climax (the floating leaf) occurs smoothly upon "focusing her intent," lacking a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a price must be paid to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared (cliffs collapsing) but never viscera felt because the protagonist's competence is absolute. The conflict is resolved the moment it is addressed, with no escalation or moment where the outcome is in doubt. The lack of opposition or trade-offs strips the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are internal and declared ("fragile thread of self") but lack on-page pressure; Anya’s arrival dissolves tension rather than escalating it. The resolution comes without a difficult trade-off or visible cost, making the "daring" act feel safe.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely internal and retrospective, lacking urgent on-page pressure or the threat of irreversible consequence. The conflict is resolved by a philosophical redefinition of the promise ("intention, not geography") that lowers the stakes rather than meeting them. The protagonist faces no active opposition, only the passive passage of time.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain purely abstract (intellectual curiosity) with no immediate threat or time pressure to force a tightening of options. The protagonist faces no external opposition or internal barrier to using the glass; the "test" of kindness is passed instantly via exposition, resulting in a low-tension vignette rather than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal, as the "pressure" is atmospheric rather than antagonistic or internal; there is no active opposition to Elara's ritual. The interaction with Mateo is frictionless and benevolent, lacking the escalation or cost necessary to drive the score higher. The stakes remain abstract ("to instill quiet witness") rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the stakes are internal but the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The rising tide creates nominal urgency, but the ritual works perfectly on the first try. The resolution is unearned by struggle, lacking the escalation or "tightening" required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.3)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist encounters no external resistance, time pressure, or internal doubt while executing her plan. The dominant stake of isolation is resolved through a frictionless, accumulative process rather than a testing of resolve or a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are established early (community fracturing, job loss), but the primary antagonist (the tricksters) provides no active resistance during the scene. The victory feels inevitable once the machine is turned on, lacking a moment of high-pressure doubt or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The physical stakes are established (walls crushing), but the escalation is cut short by the immediate efficacy of the solution (playing the scale). The protagonist faces the pressure of the "organ loft," but the tension dissipates instantly upon action. The lack of a difficult trade-off or complicating coincidence leaves the conflict feeling low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low within the scene; Elara faces no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure once at the quarry. The success is immediate and lacks a "try/fail" cycle or a deepening of cost beyond the initial effort.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake (survival) is high, but the conflict is deflated by the technician's immediate acceptance of Elara's theory based on a convenient micro-tremor. There is no meaningful push-and-pull or escalation of interpersonal tension; the obstacle is removed by authorial fiat rather than protagonist maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no external pressure testing the protagonist's resolve. The resolution is immediate and frictionless, lacking an escalation of conflict or a moment where options are genuinely narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Kai offers no meaningful resistance to Leo's advice, turning the interaction into a lecture rather than a dramatic struggle. While a cost is paid (the money), the lack of interpersonal pressure flattens the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the narrative moves from a state of fatigue to enlightenment without a distinct tightening of options or a moment of high-stakes trade-off. The conflict is resolved by the arrival of information, bypassing the need for the protagonist to endure a visible cost or make a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    The conflict is nominally internal but resolved via an external magical process that meets little resistance. The protagonist’s agency is limited to a single moment of "surrender" that lacks a visible price or trade-off, failing to generate genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist (the rift/shattered covenant) is passive and offers no resistance to the protagonist's actions. There is no moment of doubt or escalation where the outcome is in question, nor is there a tangible trade-off or loss. The "painful cartography" is mentioned as a concept but does not manifest as a limiting factor on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)
    Narrative pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition and the internal conflict is resolved through a willing, frictionless trade. The stakes feel weightless because the "cost" of absorbed sorrow is stated abstractly without forcing a difficult tactical change or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    The internal stakes are clear (shame vs. integrity), but the external pressure is entirely backstory. The conflict resolves too smoothly through realization; there is no moment where Leo nearly fails or retreats, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost—abandoning his career—is stated conceptually but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly internal and emotional, escalating from another failed experiment to the decision to sacrifice the "talisman" of grief. The cost is legible—giving up the seed and the old methodology—though the moment of decision lacks a sharp "tightening" or hesitation that would heighten the dramatic price. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's specific background as a translator.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or escalation; the "smelting" process encounters no resistance and the ritual proceeds smoothly. The stakes ("preserving wonder") remain abstract and theoretical, never forcing a trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict (clutching grief vs. releasing it) is legible, and the climax forces a choice with a tangible cost (the pearl). However, the "struggle" is resolved quickly with a wave of magical affirmation ("felt lighter"), mitigating the sense of loss or difficulty in the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is largely static; there is no escalation of pressure, only a sequence of observations leading to an epiphany. The protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are declared ("shatter her newfound peace") but the on-page conflict lacks grit; the external pressure of the library is minimal, as the books reveal their contents easily. The tension relies heavily on the "two letters" frame, which operates mostly off-stage, leaving the present-moment struggle feeling low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict between preservation and propagation is sharp, and the stakes are clearly communicated. The climax delivers a tangible, irreversible cost—the destruction of a unique artifact—satisfying the requirement for a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "threshold of stillness" acts as a timing mechanism rather than an antagonist. Elara faces no failure state, resource scarcity, or opposing force, resulting in a ritual completion that lacks dramatic tension or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the internal obstacle ("shards of resentment") dissolves without resistance during a meditative climb. There is no external opposition, and the stakes of the ritual remain theoretical, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is low-heat; Elara's challenge meets little pushback, dissolving the tension almost immediately. The "cost" of the unhooking is described as profound but plays out as a simple physical action without a dramatized struggle or sacrifice of a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear, but the conflict is low-pressure and largely intellectual. The epiphany arrives through observation rather than a sharp, escalating test of agency, though the cost of withholding grief is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (spiritual navigation), the on-page tension is low; there is no antagonist or active opposition, and the protagonist succeeds on his first attempt without visible struggle or risk of failure. The cost of "never rising" is framed as a triumphant homecoming, neutralizing the potential tension of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear, but the external conflict is mild; the "impossible" spire yields easily to Elara’s specific skills without forcing difficult trade-offs during the ascent. The primary tension is internal, which is resolved effectively, but the lack of external resistance limits the sense of danger or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is internal but low-pressure; the external obstacles (finding the ship/book) offer no resistance, and the internal barrier (hiding behind truth) crumbles immediately without a fight. The stakes feel theoretical because the resolution is gifted by the logbook rather than won through a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is largely nominal; "stellar doubt" acts as a label for tension rather than a dramatized force that threatens Elara's goal. Because the alternative to her vigil is never made visceral or tempting, the ritual feels like a low-stakes maintenance task rather than a crucial test of resolve. Escalation is missing; the static bursts occur, and she handles them with immediate competence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (finding solace) is clear, and the escalation logic (naming progressively deeper fears) works. However, the cost is largely metaphorical and abstract ("tears of pure energy," "pouring regret"), lacking a gritty, on-page price or trade-off. The conflict is entirely internal and resolves smoothly without external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are established as cosmic, but the on-page conflict is low-voltage; the protagonist faces no active opposition or agonizing trade-off, only the passage of time. The success feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-stakes test of the "brittle" devotion mentioned in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is clear but low-stakes; the antagonist (bureaucracy) is abstract and absent from the scene, offering no active resistance. The resolution feels smooth and contemplative rather than forged through high-pressure choices or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces a single abstract obstacle (the violence of flame) and resolves it immediately by looking up. There is no deepening of the dilemma, no failed attempt that raises stakes, and no pressure forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal, predicated on a backstory memory rather than immediate external pressure. The climax is a simple administrative correction with no obstacles; the immediate acceptance by Control deflates the tension completely.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=2.9)
    The dominant stake (emotional numbness) is resolved via a transaction that yields pure gain without a visible or felt cost. The external stake (custody battle) is explicitly dismissed as "irrelevant" rather than complicating the protagonist's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no active opposition or obstacle; the "investors" mentioned are backstory ghosts who exert no present pressure. The central action—planting a seed—is performed without risk or trade-off; if the seed failed, the protagonist would lose nothing. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict is internal and atmospheric, centered on the struggle against silence. While the escalation works through the sensory intensification of the machine, the stakes remain largely emotional and symbolic without strong external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are effectively polarized between the comfort of home and the hard-won purpose of exile. The pressure of the rift opening is felt, and the cost of the decision—the lingering but transformed ache—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared ("stifling destiny") but not dramatized through immediate threat; the antagonist is a memory. The escalation is internal and swift, lacking a moment where the protagonist must pay a price or sacrifice something valued to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain purely internal and philosophical; while the goal is clear, the escalation is linear, with Elara succeeding on her first attempt without facing a "live option" of failure. The cost paid ("shedding armor") is conceptual and stated rather than felt through a difficult trade-off or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; Leo identifies the problem and solves it immediately with his first attempt. There is no opposition, no moment of doubt, and no trade-off required to succeed, draining the high stakes (lost ferry) of any narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely conceptual and internal ("visualize the invisible"). The pressure comes from a vague environmental shift ("subtle dissonance") rather than an antagonist or concrete obstacle, resulting in low tension that is resolved by a sudden, unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.2)
    Dominant stakes are declared but never tested under pressure; the "conflict" is a mild pedagogical question that is immediately answered. There is no escalation or risk of failure, resulting in a scene with zero tension and a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal and internal, centered on the technical effort of "listening hard." There is no external opposition or escalating pressure that threatens failure. The resolution comes without a felt price, resulting in a low-stakes procedural beat rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is driven almost entirely by the external ticking clock (tide), lacking a meaningful escalation of the internal stakes. The protagonist faces no trade-offs; he executes his plan and the internal obstacle (fear) vanishes instantly upon success.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal, as the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure during the vigil. The stakes are declared ("existence") but remain theoretical, as the ritual proceeds smoothly to success. Escalation is tracked numerically (heartbeats) rather than through situational tightening or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high (death of a language) but practically low, as Elara faces no active opposition or possibility of failure. The "rumored curse" is dismissed immediately as benign dormancy, removing the potential for tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes (career vs. protecting the miracle) are established, but the on-page conflict is largely internal and passive; Aris watches the event and decides, rather than being forced into a corner by active opposition. The escalation is visual rather than causal pressure on the protagonist’s choices until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is underdeveloped; the antagonist forces (statues) are set up as threats but offer no active opposition, dissolving immediately. The physical struggle with the vines is brief and lacks a moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.7)
    Tension is introduced via the patrol drone but dissipates immediately upon the use of the "thunderstorm in a bottle," which functions as a risk-free problem solver. There is no escalation of stakes; the obstacle is removed instantly, and Kael recorks the bottle without penalty. The lack of a visible trade-off or cost flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are low and purely internal, with no external pressure or time constraint forcing the protagonist's hand. The resolution comes without a significant setback or complication; the environment yields the solution (the fragment) too easily, lowering the cost of the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low and abstract throughout; failure would simply mean continuing a search that has no immediate deadline or consequence. There is no active opposition or escalating pressure; the protagonist moves from curiosity to resolution via meditation and memory without encountering a significant obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no escalation or opposition; the protagonist desires a dream, performs a task without obstacle, and succeeds in a spiritual sense. The dominant stake (longing) is resolved by a sudden shift in perspective without the protagonist facing a difficult choice or the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no genuine conflict or escalation; the "fear" guarding the lock is personified but offers no actual resistance, recoiling immediately upon the locksmith's first attempt. The resolution is achieved without cost or trade-off, lacking the friction required for a literary narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is internal but low-pressure; the protagonist waits for an alignment rather than making difficult active choices. The cost of the resolution falls entirely on the backstory character (Elara), leaving the protagonist to simply receive enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes of "reversible exile" are high in concept, but the on-page conflict is low-friction; Elara’s resistance melts away after a single lecture and demonstration. The struggle feels intellectual rather than visceral, lacking a sense of risk or cost until the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the antagonist is an abstract "creeping gray" that offers no immediate opposition. Elara overcomes the minor conceptual resistance with instant competence, devoid of risk or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story lacks active opposition or genuine stakes; the "restless spirits" pose no threat, and the unraveling process proceeds without risk of failure. The protagonist's success feels inevitable, and the emotional cost is described ("tears") rather than felt through a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the investigation proceeds without opposition, risk of failure, or personal consequence. The stakes remain abstract ("interpretation," "connection") and are never threatened, resulting in a low-pressure narrative that feels more like a procedural report than a drama.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant external obstacles or difficult trade-offs. The tape is found, cleaned, and played without failure, and the internal conflict is resolved through observation rather than a high-stakes decision. The "cost" of the ending feels stated rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or active obstacle opposing Elara's goal. The storm serves as a passive timer rather than a source of escalating pressure, and success is guaranteed from the start, rendering the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the protagonist faces no risks or difficult choices, merely observing a reveal. The lack of stakes or meaningful tightening creates a passive "scenic route" narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Tension is primarily internal, sustained by the high stakes of the "tether snap" and the emotional weight of the project. While the external pressure is low—turbulence is brief and resolved by writing—the cost of the final "Peace" (surrendering rescue for connection) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear—the loss of a life’s work—and the external pressure of the demolition crew provides a functional deadline. The conflict is resolved through internal recontextualization rather than external action. While the cost is conceptually high (abandoning the murals), the ease of her acceptance dampens the potential dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or pressure; the problem is presented and immediately solved via observation. The protagonist faces no opposition, time crunch, or risk of failure, resulting in a flat narrative arc. The "stakes" are theoretical (stranded ship) rather than immediately felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal and lacks escalation; the stakes regarding the mentor are distant and theoretical. The obstacle—a broken gear—is resolved through competence and a sudden epiphany ("she understood the rhythm") rather than a pressure-cooker choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared (the blight) but never felt through resistance; the solution is immediate and mechanically flawless. There is no meaningful tightening or deepening of the conflict; the ghost provides the instructions, the characters follow them, and the problem vanishes. The lack of failure or sacrifice makes the victory feel inevitable and flat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ticking clock provides inherent pressure, but the absence of opposition or unexpected obstacles keeps tension low. Elara is fully competent and unchallenged; the stakes are existential, yet the conflict is muted by her serene acceptance of the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are immediate and high (the family's survival), and the pressure of the setting sun provides a clear ticking clock. The conflict is resolved through a focused, high-stakes process of assembly where precision is the key weapon. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no external pressure or escalation to test the protagonist's resolve. The conflict dissolves smoothly upon the first insight, lacking the tightening or deepening required for narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and conceptual; the "courage to face the blank" is declared but not felt on the page. There is no external opposition or visible cost to the incision, resulting in a low-tension narrative where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "perilous" nature of the contagion is stated but not dramatically tested; Aris encounters the pain and immediately resolves it with his skills. The stakes flatten because the threat of "flooding his spirit" never forces a difficult trade-off or near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is a passive mechanical fault that yields immediately to the protagonist's first attempt at repair. There is no escalation of stakes in the scene; once the problem is identified, the path to success is a straight line without trade-offs or rising danger. The "metallic fatigue" and "stubborn brass" are overcome with ease, robbing the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; Elara seeks connection and achieves it immediately without external opposition or internal struggle. The stakes are abstract, and the "chaos" she embraces resolves instantly into "order" without exacting a visible price or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    Tension is low because the protagonist executes her plan perfectly against a theoretical clock; the "gravity inversion" is a mechanic she navigates without error. There is no active opposition or unexpected complication that forces a hard trade-off or a change in tactics. The stakes are high in concept (lost history) but low in the immediate scene because the risk never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no active opposition or scarcity; the protagonist faces no obstacles in achieving her goal. The stakes remain abstract ("converse with [silence]") and are never threatened, resulting in zero escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely retrospective and abstract; the primary conflict is a memory of the "Scorpion's Gambit." The escalation relies on an external "spike in energy" to trigger the climax, rather than active agentic pressure or risk in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "stubborn" clasp yields to a simple adjustment of dials, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure, exposure, or misunderstanding. The stakes are purely theoretical—recovering a silence—and the "cost" is reduced to aestheticized tears that do not impede her function or alter her future tactics. There is no escalation of pressure; the fireworks provide external noise but do not tension the internal ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes remain theoretical, as the anticipated "stench" never arrives to test the protagonist's resolve. The central conflict is resolved through passive waiting, offering no meaningful escalation, setbacks, or paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.0)
    External and internal conflict are minimal; the environment aids rather than opposes Kael, and the "blight" is a distant stake not pressing on the scene. The climax is an observation rather than a high-stakes choice under pressure, lacking a moment where failure felt possible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are abstract (future foresight) with no immediate pressure or time constraint on Kael. The conflict is purely intellectual until the coincidence occurs; there is little resistance or difficult choice-making on the page beyond the procedural work.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no tangible conflict or antagonist; nature and the magic system cooperate fully with the protagonist's intentions. The stakes remain purely abstract ("certify wonder"), and because success is immediate and unhindered, there is no escalation or dramatic tension. The climax lacks a pivot point where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are purely internal and retrospective, lacking urgent pressure in the present moment. While the emotional cost is described ("tears traced paths"), the conflict does not foreclose a tangible external option or force a sacrifice beyond simple acceptance, keeping tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict remains abstract and internal; the "violent force" of the climax dissipates immediately upon the protagonist's realization. The external stakes (vanishing stars) function as a mirror to the internal state rather than a resisting force, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the narrative moves linearly from anxiety to relief without testing the protagonist's commitment or forcing a trade-off. The stakes remain abstract and internal, with the resolution arriving via a convenient magical activation rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is purely internal and low-pressure; the protagonist accepts the shattering of his worldview instantly upon seeing the evidence. The lack of resistance or struggle to maintain his prior belief minimizes the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.0)
    The antagonist ("raveling silence") is abstract, making the conflict feel theoretical rather than visceral. While the ultimate cost is high (her life), the protagonist accepts it instantly "without regret," removing the tension of the choice. The struggle is externalized against an atmospheric force rather than grounded in agency.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dramatic tension is negligible; while the planetary stakes are high, the immediate obstacle is nonexistent as the magic silk works instantly. The lack of an antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure during the ritual leaves the scene without a pulse. The "struggle" is purely thematic and retrospective, lacking urgent, on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are stated (oblivion) but the threat is resolved almost instantly by a shift in "intent," lacking visceral struggle. The antagonist is a misunderstanding, which is cleared up by the shard's revelation rather than a hard-won confrontation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are purely internal and thematic (preserving legacy) rather than visceral; the external crisis (dark reefs) creates a backdrop of danger that the protagonist does not directly engage. The lack of obstacles—the stones are ready, the ritual goes smoothly, no physical impediment arises—keeps the narrative tension low, relying entirely on the solemnity of the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation lacks a visceral cost; Kael resolves the self-made crisis with professional competence ("sweat," "focus") rather than a painful trade-off or sacrifice. The tension resolves too smoothly, missing a "dark night of the soul" moment where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist simply waits for the sun to move, offering no resistance or complicating factors. The stakes remain purely internal and abstract ("why did narratives cling to her?"), and the resolution offers a gain in wisdom without demanding any sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; the struggle against the "sorrow" was performed over the prior three seasons, not in this scene. The climax relies on the weather clearing, creating a low-stakes resolution where success is granted by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the realm—is high in concept but low in on-page friction; the "endless night" offers little active resistance to Elara's magic. The resolution comes without a felt sacrifice or trade-off; she gains wholeness and saves the world simultaneously, making the victory feel low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes remain purely internal and low-pressure, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or time-critical external threat despite the ticking clock. The climax—a vision of praise and forgiveness—deflates the tension rather than escalating it, offering a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the solution is handed to her without a difficult trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; the terms "insurgency" and "revolution" are applied to low-stakes gardening without any active opposition or risk. The story declares stakes ("erosion of the familiar") but does not test them in the scene, resulting in a static vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes are abstract and thematic (oblivion vs. memory) rather than visceral; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or difficult trade-off, merely the inevitable decay of the object.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Tension is described ("tightening the coil") rather than felt, largely due to the summary nature of the escalation beats. The conflict resolves too easily when the antagonist collapses immediately upon accusation, missing the opportunity for a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.3)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal barrier that requires a difficult trade-off. She puts on the ring and succeeds immediately, reducing the "fortress of doubt" to a minor inconvenience. The stakes remain theoretical because failure is never a palpable risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist attempts the drawing and succeeds immediately without opposition or tactical failure. The resolution is granted by an external magical object (the note) rather than earned through a costly decision or sacrifice, leaving the stakes feeling low.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain largely thematic; the conflict is resolved through observation and epiphany rather than a high-pressure decision with visible cost. The journey encounters offer low-resistance confirmations of the theme rather than escalating obstacles that force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes are abstract and external ("the world grows gray"), never manifesting as immediate resistance or risk within the scene. The ritual proceeds flawlessly, creating a flat tension arc where the outcome is never in doubt and no meaningful price is exacted for success.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and low-pressure; the "cost" of burning the objects is mitigated by the reinterpretation of the promise to keep them safe. The resolution feels procedural rather than a high-stakes test of the protagonist's core values.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.3)
    Stakes are low and opposition is negligible; the city official surrenders immediately to a sentimental gesture, removing any sense of genuine threat. The resolution requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off from Elara, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable and devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival/research), but the escalation is dampened by the ease of the solution; the dice provide the answer, and a brief dance yields the epiphany. The protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a visceral threat requiring a painful sacrifice or costly exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pressure is low; the central obstacle (fluctuating gravity) causes a single stumble before being bypassed by intuition. While the sacrifice of the physical flowers for the memory provides a form of closure cost, the lack of escalation prior to the climax flattens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "coded prophecy" is a static obstacle that offers no active resistance or counter-move to Elara's magic. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or trade-offs, and the resolution is achieved through a single, successful application of ability without escalation or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conflict is low-stakes and largely internal; Mrs. Davison offers gentle correction rather than genuine opposition, resulting in a soft narrative arc. While the shift in stance is clear, the lack of significant external pressure or risk makes the "interrogation" feel more like a misunderstanding than a clash of values.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a near-total absence of active resistance or opposition; the environment, the magic system, and the memory all cooperate instantly. Without the possibility of failure or a moment where the protagonist must improvise under stress, the stakes remain theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure once inside the sanctuary. The "calibrated treason" provides backstory stakes, but the scene itself lacks a tightening of options or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the "web of intrigue" is summarized rather than felt, and there is no active opposition or dilemma to force a trade-off. The resolution is achieved through a magical song without visible cost, sacrifice, or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or dilemma that forces a trade-off. The narrative escalation is replaced by a smooth procedural meditation, resulting in stakes that are declared ("awaiting redemption") but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.2)
    There are no discernible stakes or conflict; the character is at peace from the start and faces no threat, time limit, or difficult trade-off. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening of pressure, resulting in a static meditation rather than a story. The "climax" (whistling) resolves nothing because nothing was at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. safety) is clear, and the cost of the decision is felt in the final silence. However, the conflict is resolved primarily through reading and epiphany; the lack of external pressure or a "live" threat reduces the urgency of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are high but abstract, and the conflict is resolved by coincidence (weather) and a distant treasure hunt rather than direct confrontation or sacrifice. The antagonist is a distant monolith who never applies immediate pressure in the scene to force a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or escalation; the music box is found and fixed without issue, the sound is captured perfectly, and peace is achieved instantly. Without an antagonist, a failure, or a significant internal barrier, the stakes remain theoretical and the victory feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is coherent, driven by the mechanical failure and the Chime's distress. However, the conflict remains a linear technical puzzle; the protagonist adapts her method, but the stakes never force a difficult moral trade-off or a choice between incompatible values.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared conceptually ("revolution," "tyranny") but face no concrete on-page test or risk of failure; the ritual simply proceeds to success. The conflict is resolved by "surrender" and breathing, lacking a visible price or trade-off required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are internal and retrospective; there is no active antagonist or immediate time pressure in the tunnel to force difficult choices. The escalation comes from receiving information via the lantern rather than a tightening of options or a confrontation with the antagonist. The "struggle" is solved too easily by the supernatural element.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is weak; the obstacle is removed by luck (the light) rather than a costly trade-off or intense effort. Elias accepts the resolution without paying a visible on-page price, making the emotional payoff feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is largely absent from the scenes; obstacles are summarized in the transition rather than faced on the page. The climax involves executing a process without opposition, trade-offs, or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The central conflict is clear, but the opposition (Director Vance) is a cardboard obstacle who appears once and is easily circumvented by a lie without visible on-page tension or back-and-forth struggle. The stakes are stated as "truth vs. erasure" but lack visceral, immediate danger to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the antagonist force (the ice) offers "not resistance, but... deep, resonant calm" the moment the protagonist acts. There is no escalation, no moment where the plan fails or requires adaptation, and no cost paid for the victory. The "silent terror" is told, not felt through pressure that narrows the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the conflict between fear and acceptance is resolved too easily by the journal discovery. There is little escalation or genuine opposition on the page; the "storm" is backstory, and the immediate scene lacks a pressure cooker element to force the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.0)
    Escalation is virtually non-existent; the couple's conflict is resolved by external intervention without any push-back, refusal, or negotiation. There is no visible or felt cost for the reconciliation, resulting in a low-stakes, fable-like progression.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are abstract (the potential loss of an echo) and the opposition is purely technical, lacking an active antagonist or deep internal flaw. The success feels inevitable; the constraint of "peripheral awareness" serves as a rule rather than a source of escalating pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; opposition evaporates immediately. Liam's generational bitterness melts at the sight of a single line on a photograph, bypassing the necessary struggle of reconciliation. There is no escalation of pressure, only a linear progression of successful interventions.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract and philosophical without a concrete on-page test or cost; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or internal doubt to generate tension. The "tightening" is merely the arrival of dawn, and the resolution comes without sacrifice or tactical adjustment. The story relies on a passive "Situational" flow that lacks the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are deeply felt but remain internal and abstract ("connection vs. oblivion"), lacking external friction or opposition. The escalation proceeds linearly through the placement of markers without significant setbacks or reversals that test Elara's commitment. While the emotional cost of the "receding tide" is stated, the immediate struggle feels relatively smooth and procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (1.7-second window), but the conflict is resolved through a moment of Zen realization rather than a forced trade-off or difficult agency. The protagonist succeeds perfectly without paying a "felt cost"—nothing is sacrificed, and the obstacle yields to a change in attitude, which lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; Elara encounters no obstacles to her goal, and the family offers no resistance to the therapy. The scene lacks narrative pressure, functioning as a smooth progression to a predetermined emotional release without creating stakes or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is severely undercut when the protagonist explicitly anticipates the only obstacle ("Elara did not flinch"), rendering the climax routine. There is no felt cost or risk of failure on the page; the conflict is purely mechanical and instantly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is entirely internal and retrospective, lacking active opposition or immediate pressure within the scene. The "village" acts as an abstract background force rather than a concrete obstacle, resulting in low tension during the pivotal moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    Tension is virtually non-existent; the polishing process encounters no physical or magical resistance, and the "fevered sleep" provides context but no immediate pressure. The protagonist faces no trade-offs or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.5)
    A dominant stake is established, and a tangible cost is paid (the pendant). However, escalation is minimal as the protagonist encounters no internal hesitation or external resistance to her plan, making the release feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    The stakes are theoretical and lack immediate scene pressure; the "current of nihilism" is an abstract antagonist that offers no concrete resistance on the page. The protagonist overcomes his "exhaustion" effortlessly to collect the hopes, leaving the central conflict without visceral weight or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "spiritual silence" is an abstract state that offers no active resistance to the protagonist's efforts. The ritual succeeds "instantly" and flawlessly, devoid of the escalation, setbacks, or trade-offs necessary to generate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is largely abstract—endurance against entropy—without immediate, active opposition. While the "drop of blood" introduces a moment of intensification, the stakes remain thematic and the lack of a live, resisting force limits narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is static and low-stakes; Kael faces a puzzle, not pressure. He observes comfortably from dawn to dusk without urgency, escalating obstacles, or a risk of failure that would force a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is relatively low-stakes and internal; the "resistance" of the anxiety is overcome quickly via a shift in Elara's focus ("Orientation is empathy"). There is no moment where failure feels imminent or where the cost of success forces a painful sacrifice, limiting the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal and retrospective; the protagonist faces no active resistance or dilemma on the page, relying on a pre-established competence to succeed. The stakes (peace vs. grief) are resolved by declaration and ritual rather than struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (internal reconciliation) is clear, but pressure collapses when the ghost offers immediate "empathetic warmth" instead of resistance. The absence of a complication or a moment where the outcome is in doubt drains the scene of necessary narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    There are no significant stakes or obstacles; the rusted hatch opens easily, and the "puzzle" is solved instantly with a "surge" of creativity. The lack of opposition or risk of failure flattens the tension, resulting in a procedural vignette rather than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes are purely internal, and the escalation is linear with little resistance or complication; she arrives, acts, and succeeds without narrowing options. The climax is resolved by an external force (the crystal's benevolent reaction) rather than a difficult choice made by the protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.9)
    The conflict is almost entirely retrospective, lacking urgent stakes in the present timeline. The resolution—choosing documentation over vengeance—feels unearned because the impulse for vengeance was never credibly established or wrestled with in the scene. The "upheaval" is described as serene, removing tension rather than heightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the fisherman cooperates immediately, and the central challenge of "decoding" is resolved instantly without error, struggle, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; Elara encounters no obstacles to her understanding, and the "mystery" yields itself immediately upon her request. The stakes remain abstract and intellectual; she risks nothing and loses nothing in the process of discovery. The ending arrives without pressure, resulting in a low-tension experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear and high for the character. The escalation—succeeding in the ritual only to watch the creation fade—provides a meaningful reversal. The cost is felt in the loss of the living bird, forcing the protagonist to accept a lesser, symbolic victory.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or active internal resistance during the scene. The stakes are abstract ("legacy," "shame") and are not tested by a concrete on-page threat or difficult choice, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or risk; the protagonist faces no opposition, pays no price, and encounters no failure state. The "doubt" mentioned is abstract and fleeting, never impeding action or forcing a trade-off. The conflict is purely distinct procedural work—slotting keys into locks—resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; the text claims a "miscalculation" would be disastrous, but the protagonist succeeds instantly and easily. There is no antagonist, no failure, and no trade-off, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes remain abstract, and the central conflict (a creative block) dissolves instantly upon the mentor's advice. There is no escalation of pressure or visible trade-off required to reach the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical ("bread burned") rather than visceral, and the central conflict (grit in the gears) offers no active resistance or escalation. The protagonist's success feels inevitable from the start, resulting in a lack of genuine tension or pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; Elara enters, performs a task without obstacle, and receives the answer immediately. The stakes remain abstract (community confusion) and do not force a trade-off or difficult decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal and strictly internal; the "doubt" appears and is immediately dismissed by reviewing the model, creating no sense of escalation or risk. The stakes are declared (community survival) but not tested in the scene; the protagonist faces no opposition or time pressure that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly established ("secrecy was survival"), but the on-page pressure is relatively low heat; the interference provides a moment of tension, but the resolution (checking the window) is low-cost. The "survival" stakes feel somewhat theoretical, as the antagonist (the mist/authorities) remains abstract and distant. The narrative relies on internal endurance rather than external escalation, which works for the length but limits the dramatic intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.4)
    Narrative tension is low because the protagonist faces no risk of failure; the chair's slowing creates a clock, but it does not pressure her choices or force a tradeoff. The execution of the ritual is flawless from start to finish, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (preservation of truth) is signaled early and tested by the discovery of the tablet. However, the pressure remains largely internal and hypothetical, as the antagonist (Councilor Valerius) exists only in Kael's mind. The escalation is logical under a Situational lens, but the lack of immediate external friction limits the palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict is established ("town remained fractured") but de-escalated via summary rather than confrontation. There is no singular "tightening" moment on the page where the outcome is in doubt; the narrative smooths over the friction between Liam and Anya, resulting in low stakes and a resolution that feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no opposition; Arlo enters, succeeds immediately, and leaves, with the "celestial alignment" acting as a convenient catalyst rather than a pressure cooker. The "cost" of channeling memories is stated ("tears") but not felt as a loss or trade-off that complicates the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is negligible; the interaction is a transaction of information rather than a clash of goals. There is no resistance from the engineer, no risk of the riddle being rejected, and no escalation of pressure before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are incredibly low; there is no antagonist, no time pressure, and no clear consequence for failure. The protagonist faces no external or internal obstacles that force a difficult trade-off; the "hushed blaze" is gained through simple ritual action rather than struggle. The narrative lacks the tightening pressure required to make the final realization feel like a victory.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=1.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; Kael faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical obstacle that resists his plan. The resolution is immediate and total, lacking the escalation, risk, or trade-offs required to generate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are internal but clear: fidelity versus emptiness. The climax offers a meaningful choice—entering the past vs. witnessing it—and the cost of her refusal (staying in confinement) is felt, though the "math magic" mechanism lowers the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or opposition; the "smog-choked city" is an abstract antagonist that offers no concrete resistance to Elara's plan. Her attempt meets immediate success without forcing her to improvise, sacrifice, or endure failure, resulting in a flat narrative line where the outcome is never in doubt. The stakes remain theoretical ("proving kindness") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.6)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely a puzzle to solve by looking at a wall. The resolution comes without a visible or felt cost—the "dread dissolved" instantly upon baking—resulting in low narrative tension and a lack of earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; Elara faces no external opposition, risk of failure, or tangible cost. The execution of her plan proceeds without a hitch, resulting in a victory that feels unearned because nothing of value was sacrificed or risked to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is intellectual rather than visceral; the antagonist capitulates immediately to a dictionary quote. The protagonist's offer of his "emptiness" as bait carries no felt risk, resulting in low tension and a tidy victory.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the external stakes (survival of the orchard) are established, the escalation is linear and lacks a decisive turning point where the protagonist is forced to adapt or lose something. The conflict is resolved through procedure rather than high-pressure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.5)
    There is a distinct lack of active conflict or escalation within the scene. The antagonist (the rusted gate) is passive, and the protagonist overcomes it instantly with her first attempt. There is no moment where the plan fails or requires a painful trade-off; the stakes are theoretical (freedom) rather than viscerally endangered in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition (internal doubt or external antagonist) and pays no visible price. The "struggle" is purely retrospective, leaving the scene devoid of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely thematic ("oblivion") and lack immediate, concrete consequences for the protagonist. The conflict is a mild race against the tide, but the pressure never forces a difficult trade-off or significant change in tactics. The "tightening" is limited to a single metallic clang that prompts a hurried final note.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are intellectual and abstract; despite the "Restricted Vault" setting, there is no felt presence of opposition or risk of failure. The blackout removes urgency rather than adding pressure ("she felt no urgency"), resulting in a flat escalation curve where the protagonist executes a task without facing a meaningful trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict is purely internal, yet it is resolved via a magical technology that functions perfectly without cost or resistance. There is no escalation of stakes; the process smooths over the potential struggle, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are legible, and the timer provides external pressure, but the central conflict is resolved through a passive vision rather than an active struggle. The protagonist accepts the "crushing weight" too smoothly, lowering the felt cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the drone finds the target instantly, the stone moves with a single pull, and the machine activates on the first try. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist must navigate a tightening set of options. The stakes remain abstract ("hollow ache") and are resolved without a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict is internal but resolved too easily by the convenient discovery of the symbolic object. While the stakes (truth vs. comfort) are clear, the escalation lacks interpersonal pressure or genuine obstacles; the protagonist simply walks down stairs, finds an answer, and walks back up.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is minimal because the outcome—the exchange—is pre-arranged and proceeds without disruption, doubt, or external resistance. The conflict is entirely internal and retrospective, lacking a live, on-page test of Elias’s resolve or a moment where the stakes are genuinely imperiled.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate naturally when the protagonist's chosen method of navigation fails. The pressure is coherent, forcing a decisive action (using the compass) that confronts the central fear. The cost is primarily internal (shame, fear), which fits the scope, though the opposition dissolves relatively quickly once the choice is made.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    Obstacles are introduced and resolved almost instantaneously (e.g., rockfall -> recalled obituary -> path clears), creating a lack of genuine pressure. The central conflict—regaining empathy—is resolved by "stopping fighting," a mental switch-flip that lacks a visible, felt cost or the hesitation of a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are conceptually high—the loss of human form—but the escalation is weak because the protagonist’s resistance is overcome with narrative ease. There is no moment where the ritual threatens to fail or where Elara seriously considers abandoning her goal, draining the "reluctance" of its narrative tension. The cost is paid in the final image, but the absence of active on-page struggle limits the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and strictly internal, with no escalation of risk or meaningful opposition to the protagonist's goal. The climax offers no difficult trade-off; the anxiety simply evaporates upon the realization, resulting in low tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the abstract stakes are high (extinction vs. life), the immediate conflict is negligible; the protagonist succeeds at her task on the first attempt with minimal resistance. The "shadow work" is resolved instantly through acceptance, lacking the friction or cost required to generate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off, merely performing a planned ritual without obstacles. The stakes remain intellectual and abstract ("to understand"), and the resolution arrives without significant on-page conflict or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; while the goal (revolution) is high-concept, the on-page execution meets zero resistance. The protagonist faces no active opposition, close calls, or unforeseen hurdles, resulting in a procedural tone devoid of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are high globally but the immediate scene pressure is low; the "vision of failure" provides only momentary resistance. The resolution feels inevitable, and the cost (dimming aurora) is external/resource-based rather than a visceral personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are clear but largely internal and abstract; the conflict is resolved by the reception of wisdom (the letter) rather than a costly struggle. The protagonist's "rarefying" is framed as a victory without a palpable on-page price or trade-off beyond the release of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely intellectual and lack visceral pressure; there is no opposition or risk of failure given the protagonist's perfect calibration. The conflict is static (woman vs. puzzle), and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult choice or endurance. The lack of a "loss" or "trade-off" keeps the narrative tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.7)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist's fear of the impending change is introduced and then immediately quelled by Kael's affirmation, removing any need for a difficult trade-off. The pressure of the rising moon is external and inevitable, meaning the character's choices do not actually drive the outcome or create meaningful tension.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (reaching Leo) is clear, but the protagonist faces minimal resistance; the ritual works on the first try, and the compasses guide her without error. The narrative lacks a moment of doubt or a "tightening" where failure seems possible, resulting in a linear progression rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is low-pressure; the external threat (monsoon) serves only as a background clock and does not force a tactical trade-off or desperate measure. The internal doubt is resolved instantly by the success of the ritual, lacking the escalation or genuine risk required for high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is internal but low-stakes, as the protagonist possesses the solution (the compass) immediately and faces no obstacles in using it. There is no escalation; the ritual works instantly to provide relief, bypassing the need for a difficult decision.

    Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intuition-demanding forks narrowing options to memory surrender; agency in placing ball forecloses numbness with felt integration cost, protagonist-driven under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reforge bond) tightens via unspooling soul pressure under Accum lens, narrowing to self-loss trade-off. Agency in spice-crushing and petal-arranging forecloses mortal path with embodied cost (tears, expansion). Escalation coherent without reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (recover lost time) signaled early, deepens texturally via ritual/visions to foreclose control path; agency in micro-choices (unfasten, press thumb) with cost legible ("icy knot" melts); minor abstractness softens peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake tightens accumulatively through shadow/joy balance forcing lightness trade-off, with agency in "guided the tear... with the gentleness of a falling leaf" foreclosing forceful paths at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (grasp transformation's texture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via alignment "knowing" and release narrowing to selfless act. Cost felt in "heart swelling with bittersweet joy" and possession forfeiture. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early tightens accumulatively via shadow-code success to network pulse; agency in panel seam thumb and moss crush forecloses detection path with felt cost in "posture radiating dutiful vigilance." No reversals needed under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Curse vision deepens stake before restoration forecloses slide with aurora-dimming cost; agency in chant and dust-sprinkling drives tightening under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (vigil to map scars) signaled early, tightens via letter's constellations insight and timer chime, narrowing to writing with agency in breaking seal and steadying hand. Cost unmistakable in dam-shattering sob foreclosing prior suspension. Lens escalation via deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (decode overture) tightens via needle alignments under lens; agency in micron calibration forecloses ambiguity with felt cost (composure vs. shuddering shadow); single deepening sufficient, no reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (molt eroding resistance voice) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kael's reassurance and shared planting narrowing fear into Charged Poise; agency in kneeling/digging forecloses doubt with emotional cost. Minor abstract stakes legibility in early poems.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of grief-refuge tightens accumulatively through compass guidance to duet climax, forcing renunciation of full restoration with legible cost in one-minute gain; agency peaks in improvised encore.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (protect memory pre-monsoon) signaled early tightens via dream interpretation to silence reversal, forcing endurance with legible cost in doubt; agency in humming/planting drives awakening under Accumulative lens, reweighting options coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of finding apology color signaled early, deepens via vision reversal changing knowledge to acceptance; agency in tracing lace forecloses despair path with tearful cost on page.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“strip needless drama” vs. surrender to slow meaning—tightens when daily dust alterations force him to keep returning, forfeiting efficiency. No antagonist; pressure is accumulative: each morning’s microscopic change deepens cost of ignoring the pattern. Visible price: time, former identity (abandons equations for sketches), and the final humility of “student of patience.” One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; escalation is density-driven, not causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve or obliterate the ledger—emerges late, after the torching already happened off-page. Escalation is textural: frost patterns deepen associative tension rather than narrowing live options. Visible cost (studio ashes) is retrospective; no new forfeiture at decision beat. Tightening exists but is reflective, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into witnessed music—signaled paragraph one. Single escalation: Liam’s magenta anguish forces Elara to test her chromatic lexicon on another; risk of re-triggering either survivor tightens the beat. Cost legible: shared tear and frost-melt patch externalize consequence. No secondary reversal, but one sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: granting drowned souls permanent rest vs. threat of eternal forgetting. Single meaningful tightening: the first shard’s successful illumination of “the light failed us” proves the method works and forecloses the option to stop; each subsequent shard raises the stakes for completeness. Cost is visible in physical wear (“his weariness replaced by a quiet triumph”) and the final relinquishing of his own lamp—he trades personal darkness for collective light. No coincidence; escalation is driven solely by Elias’s agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational cohesion under sanctions—tightens once when the bell is sounded at whisper-volume; this deliberate act forecloses loud celebration forever, trading public joy for private solidarity. Pressure accumulates through nightly runs and the ever-present sanction-night chill; the soft chime crystallizes stance without external rescue. Cost is legible: the community must remain forever quiet, a price they choose to pay.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightens through breath-made-visible pattern; the deepening is the moment the map appears and she must choose release. Price is lyrical rather than material, but still legible: the stored love leaves the stone and enters her, altering her future vocation. One escalation beat suffices under the accumulative lens; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberation from retrocognitive prison—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the fragment begins to unspool, foreclosing the option to keep Aris’s moment intact. Escalation is textural: fading photos → ghost tactile presence → permanent tapestry; each layer reweights the cost of letting go. No external antagonist needed; the garden’s own geometry supplies the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“save the seeds”—is signaled early and sharpened by the noon deadline. One meaningful tightening: decoding the keys pivots the threat from certain collapse to possible sanctuary. Cost is visible (twelve years, iron wrist, symbolic chain) and alters tactics—she opts for revelation, not obstruction. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the panel opens; the crew’s capitulation is too frictionless to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering the fracture-sound) is announced early; tension, however, never escalates—absences are already collected off-page, no obstacle opposes the ritual, and no price jeopardizes success. A single micro-turn (forge glow) reweights meaning but lacks jeopardy or trade-off; pressure plateaus. Closure is contemplative, not earned through tighter options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she ever hear destiny speak?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the moonbeam arrow overwrites the noon warning. One visible price: the jar empties, foreclosing future code-theft shortcuts. Agency drives the turn—she physically re-codes the bouquet and refuses the train. Coincidence (the schedule’s hidden double message) complicates rather than resolves, consistent with situational lens. Cost is legible; escalation could edge higher had the forest path posed an immediate physical danger, but the existential forfeiture is credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can a safe zone be built that does not distort truth—tightens once: perfect vessel fails → must embrace flaw. Escalation is density/cadence shift under Accumulative lens: drip → fracture → rainbow refraction. Protagonist agency drives the turn (she carries piece to bin). Price paid: lost time, material, ego; new aesthetic rule set.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protection of Lily and self-liberation from Silas—is signaled by word 88 and tightened when headlights slice the roof. Escalation is causal: each decryption discovery reduces escape routes until the shell itself is weaponized. The price is legible: Elara’s phobia is not defeated but endured in the climb, and Silas remains at large, preserving threat. One meaningful turn—choosing ascent over concealment—forecloses hiding and crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—map the night’s silence before the last star vanishes—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens as stellar extinction approaches; each flake lost = live option erased. No antagonist needed; the clock alone escalates. Cost is legible: the star’s pale-out coincides with the map’s completion, sealing her vigil’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—does thought arise from code or from layered experience?—is signaled early and tightens when the violin’s resonance forces a choice: continue looping or amalgamate. The single meaningful deepening occurs at loop 31 when archived “resonant objects” surface; thereafter pressure grows by accretion, not reversal. Cost is conceptual rather than material: the robot forfeits the comfort of locatable origin, a price legible in the final “serene clarity.”

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—thaw communal mistrust—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Elara decides public exposure is the only non-complicit path. One meaningful escalation: private reading → communal projection; option to remain hidden is foreclosed once moonlight hits crystal. Cost is legible in Kael’s tear and the risk of public shame; no coincidence resolves tension. Pressure remains accumulative/textural rather than adversarial, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reciprocity vs. quantified luck—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the meter drops Kael to 0.4%. The reversal is garden-driven, not Elara’s escalation, so agency feels diffused, but the visible price (cracked meter, thorn encirclement) is legible and forecloses his metric certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove sideways time—is signaled early and tested by the one-shot lever pull that cannot be undone. Escalation is single but meaningful: the lattice appears, foreclosing linear certainty and exposing him to cosmic scale. Visible price: frozen tears, trembling hands, tomorrow’s unchanged labor under new knowledge. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal/epistemic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—answer the ghost’s code—is signaled early; the five-note phrase is the single tightening that forecloses avoidance. Playing it risks further haunting yet completes the silence; the cost is the chill, the steadying flame, the sustained note that dissolves abandonment. Escalation is textural—each water stain deepening meaning—rather than causal reversal, fully apt under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—locate the buried guilt—tightens when the smudge reveals the hidden bud, forcing acknowledgment. One meaningful deepening suffices: pride swallowed the warning, now humility must occupy the margin. Cost is legible in the tear that darkens the page and the whispered vow that ends her predictive certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure escalates under accrual of sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—vindicate grand-father—is signaled immediately; pressure tightens when his personal safety of unbelief conflicts with tangible artifact (blue beads). The stakes move from reputational to moral once Leo feels the cold wheel and grasps that opening the valve will shame the foreman’s kin; options collapse into one audible click. Cost is visible on-page; the silent tunnel amplifies the social price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is declared early; pressure tightens only texturally via encroaching decay and the river’s new channel. No live option is foreclosed; her return is inevitable. Silence deepens, but agency remains observational, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for accumulative escalation, yet lacks a beat where judgment would actually tempt her.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling Liam’s wonder—surfaces early. Pressure escalates via sensory deepening: daylight dims, birds quit, guitar softens, curl transfers. The eclipse is situational pressure, not coincidence; it crystallizes stance rather than solving externals. Visible price: Elara loses exclusive custody of her relic; Liam risks awe in front of a stranger—both costs on page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keeping the dream-space alive—tightens once: after reading Elara’s “last dream,” he must seal the fragment, forfeiting immediate communion. Agency is present, cost is legible; only one deepening keeps it from higher band.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern—tapestry threads, diary ashes, dragon eyes—culminating in Conceptual Repricing: memory itself can mend a displaced cosmos. No moralizing; final image of “dragon’s wingbeat” inside metal offers resonant non-literal answer. Complexity preserved: beauty saved first is both mercy and wound.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will spoken apology replace encoded silence?—is signaled in beat 3. One meaningful tightening: the moment Elara steps onto gravel holding only the wrapper, Silas realizes the microdot is superfluous, narrowing his options to raw honesty. Cost is visible: he abandons covert craft and twenty-year defense, crystallized in handshake. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Elara open to spectrum before the possession blooms—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened by each pedal-press. The meaningful turn is the latch click: it forecloses monochrome safety and forces spectral risk. Cost is the tear, the sob, the trembling hand—visceral, on-page. Escalation is causal under the Situational lens: pressure is coherent moral/psychological force, not coincidence; no extra reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will she finish the map before exhaustion snaps the thread?”—is signaled at 120 words and tightens once: dizziness wave forecloses further additions. Agency is pure attention and endurance; the cost is legible as blurred vision and settling silence. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure of collapsing recall suffices. Under Accumulative lens, density crescendo equals escalation; mirrored horizon payoff reweights options. Persistent constraint: she exits depleted, fortunes now irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—conquer the labyrinth of self or remain looped—is signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each procedurally-generated corridor increases emotional density until “Compassion” rune forces a fusion trade-off. Cost is visible—seventy-three prior paralyses named on-page; the final acceptance forfeits the safety of erasure. The softening of one whisper into “What if you forgave yourself?” is the single meaningful tightening that reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“defeat hollow stillness”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens through each tactile trial: membrane quiver → etched grooves → first thump. One meaningful deepening: the realization that silence is not void but “space where feeling waits” reweights options and forecloses auditory nostalgia forever. Cost is visible—she accepts a lifetime of listening through skin, needle permanently embedded in frame. Agency is hers: she closes eyes, palms flat, chooses to enthrall the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve integrity of data vs. avoid detection—is signaled in line 48 and tightens when the clay grain replaces her log. One meaningful lateral reversal—turning the compromised pigeon into a renewed carrier—escalates under causal lens because she acts *because* they probed. The price is ongoing vulnerability: every future report can betray her. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (Nimbus returning) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—why smells undo her—tightens when the UV ritual forces the test; escalation is density-driven (UV veins, scent memory avalanche). Agency visible: she uncorks despite caution, then reframes vocation. Cost is emotional tears and the acknowledged permanence of ache; could edge 9-band if a tangible external loss (e.g., shattered lantern, ruined sale) were paired to the tear baptism.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—possess the texture of time versus preserve the last thread of another man’s sacrifice—tightens the moment the rope is dangled, not used. Escalation is textural: each deeper vibration under his palms raises the cost of destruction. The refusal itself is the reversal that forecloses the descent; the price is the forfeiture of certainty, legible in the final whisper to the clay.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the first note is deliberately allowed to stay slightly flattened; perfection is foregone. Escalation is textural: each phrase of the Ember Song layers sound into silence, shifting the hush from enemy to receptive canvas; no external antagonist needed. The visible price is beautiful fatigue in her bowing arm and the irreversible leaving of the bowl, making the silence expectant rather than defeated. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve artistic purity vs. honor accidental truth. One meaningful tightening at dusk when the half-truth grief is detected; options narrow to destroy, sell, or subsume. Cost is visceral—he absorbs Elara’s raw sorrow, forfeiting synthetic detachment. Escalation is textural, not causal reversal, but pressure grows coherent under accumulative lens and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uplift Elara—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decides on the anonymous note, foreclosing his default anonymity. Pressure grows because exposure (even anonymous) threatens his hard-won professional detachment; the price is conceptual but legible. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elias swaps “moving cargo” for “moving hearts.” No external antagonist is needed; internal resistance supplies sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—belonging—tightens once: from solitary release to collective dedication. Agency visible when Elara chooses to place, not surrender, her sculpture. Cost legible in irrevocable offering and Kael’s dissolved solitude. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    One dominant stake—liberate echo—tightens when cadence interruption offers single, non-renewable window; failure equals eternal silence. Protagonist’s borrowing of seconds visibly drains the pendant and ends the nap, so price is legible. No meaningful opposition or internal dissent, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes again.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—the need to resolve ambiguous loss—tightens once via the vision that reframes silence as presence. Escalation is a single deepening rather than a because/therefore chain, but the felt price (grief transformed, not solved) is legible on the page under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s visibility gamble—tightens once: each preparatory move (prying drywall, descent, placement) forecloses retreat. Escalation is linear but felt; the outage functions as complication, not convenience. Cost is visible: twelve years of erasure risked in a single dawn moment. No reversal mid-scene, yet the final stance crystallizes with sufficient pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—control vs collaboration—tightens once after the leaf insight; option of “perfect order” is foreclosed when she walks away without repair plan. Agency visible in every beat: leaf returned, willow left bent, journal recast. Cost legible: surrender of lifelong method. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning or drown in remembrance—tightens when the rain trails literalize the urge. One meaningful deepening: brooch shifts from private talisman to inherited debt, foreclosing the option to keep it. Escalation is textural under Accumulative lens; each remembered fragment layers weight until surrender is the only relief. Cost is legible in the tear Elara sheds and the “profound exhaustion” that finally claims him.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—community resilience versus her need for control—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she realizes her blindness is the price of faith. One meaningful deepening: the shadows overlap → golden bloom → symphony crescendo escalates under Accumulative lens, reweighting the cost from abstract “unpredictability” to audible magic she can never measure. No reversal, but the narrowing option—give up foresight or abort—carries visible price in the tears she wipes from the pilgrim’s cheek.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore communal memory without being consumed by visions—signaled early. Each staggered revelation (chart, log, shanty) deepens density, narrows Elara’s energy reserve; visionary seizures exact visceral cost on-page (“gasped, stumbling back”). No coincidences; escalation is Accumulative deepening that forces her shift from private archive to public pier performance. Price visible: she permanently trades private nostalgia for communal beacon, ending with “next interval” promise that forecloses rest.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the fortress of unspoken truths”—tightens when the dare exacts forfeiture of her maps, narrowing options to surrender or retreat. Escalation follows Accumulative pattern: each crack-arrow increases emotional ante until the punched void reweights knowledge. Cost is legible: loss of analytical armor, replaced by raw reflection. Coincidence absent; resolution arises from her conscious offering.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can the tower offer real solace without falsifying science?—tightens when aligning the tile risks Elara’s rational identity; the price is paid in irreversible belief. One meaningful escalation: the moment warmth blooms and centuries crash in, foreclosing pure skepticism. Cost is legible in the cooled stone and her promise to keep listening.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—what happens after goodbye—arrives early and remains singular. Pressure escalates texturally: storm → tear → corridor → repository, each layer thickening the cosmic inventory of farewells. Yet the protagonist makes zero on-page choice that tightens options or pays a price; he is passenger to magnetic current. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized; escalation is atmospheric, not agential. Stakes stay abstract; cost is observational, not felt by Kaelen in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape father’s legacy—tightens once: from either/or (betray vs. inherit) to integrative third path. Escalation is causal under lens: each absorption of room truth raises cost of returning to old binary. Price is legible: she commits to shielding minor players, inviting retaliation. One meaningful turn suffices at 755 words.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve erased histories—tightens when the poison label converts rumor into tactile evidence. One meaningful deepening: the shift from random collection to deliberate witness of Dr. Thorne’s true story. Agency is archival, not physical, but the choice to keep walking into the fog forecloses reclaiming his own name. Cost is felt in the ache of damp cold and the endless ebb he embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—decode the compass or remain haunted—tightens when the cello hum forces her to trade empirical proof for emotional resonance. One meaningful deepening occurs: retelling the memory narrows her options from “solve” to “cherish,” with visible cost (tears, relinquished quest). Under Accumulative lens, pressure is coherent; no external antagonist is needed. The price is felt, but not persistent—no future tactic is altered—so 8.8+ is withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival vs structural collapse—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each new mural tightens the invisible net, deepening consequence of exposure. No reversal, but a meaningful tightening when Elara’s keyhole widens the conspiracy. Cost remains communal, not personal, capping intensity at the high 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the untouched dawn—tightens once when the first gold sliver dissolves the capsule barrier, making the photo irreversible. Escalation is situational pressure: silence, cold, grief, and corporate deadline compress into the one-second exposure. Visible price is the elegiac ache Kael carries downslope; no reversal, but a meaningful narrowing of options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the drone must fly before the anchor lifts—is signaled by the harbor-bell countdown and tightens through two causal beats: discovery of fracture, application of patch. Escalation is linear, not reversals, but the clock narrows options and the final cost (her irrevocable release of the repaired emissary) is legible. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; coincidence is absent. Depth sufficient for this length but only one meaningful tightening, so shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find where the rivers begin”—is signaled in sentence two and escalates through each deciphered pattern. The final tightening arrives when interior warmth erases the literal map, forcing decision: drill tomorrow or abandon quest. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is epistemic and atmospheric. Cost is conceptual but visible: she forfeits the safety of “settled science” and embraces convergence beneath ice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“restore shared balance before collapse”—is signaled early and tightened through each footfall that forecloses the alternative of haste. Cost is legible: Elara surrenders her audible presence. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—immortalize a vanishing serenity—tightens exactly once: oxygen alarm at ten minutes converts abstract want into visceral trade-off. The unsnarling action is agency itself; each loosened strand forecloses Aris’s own survival. Cost is legible on the page: tunnel vision, black spots, final limp surrender. No escalation beyond this single but decisive tightening, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will anyone finally see the truth—signals early and tightens once: Elias’s eyewitness through the lattice forecloses the “liar’s son” excuse forever. Agency sits with Kael’s decision to show, not shout; cost is Elias’s tear and the dawn exhumation they now must perform. No coincidence; pressure grows under causal lens. Sufficient for length, but a second tightening beat (e.g., risk of being caught setting the lattice) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save Elias via orchard awakening—is signaled in first 120 words. Single tightening at Heartwood: she trades her last flicker for bloom, foreclosing survival. Pressure is accumulative; each resonance beat heightens spectral drain, cost visible in “form dissolving.” No reversals needed; the endurance itself narrows options to one final note.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mending severed memory—tightens as each overlapping dream-path forecloses alternative routes; the circle sewn around the ruined basin is the decisive narrowing that crystallizes her stance, but external opposition is absent, keeping pressure poetic rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“restore lost faith”—is signaled early and tightened once: the precise moment the new gnomon’s shadow touches the door reweights exile into custodianship. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial; sufficient for this length and lens. Cost is visible (tear, vow, surrender to continuum) but not materially punitive; still meets band guardrail for 8.8- entry.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—find the true name that honors a love’s end—is signaled early and tightens once: the chalk code eliminates both prior candidates, forcing a third. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of symbols (galaxy, bird, seven) reweights emotional cost rather than narrows external options. Price is legible—she forfeits hours of crafted work and embraces ephemeral child-art. No reversal, but single deepening suffices at 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent fleet massacre—signaled by word 103 and escalates through chart falsification reveal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she alone re-stitches safe passage, narrows coup window. Cost legible: anonymity forfeited to Captain Idris, perpetual exile implied. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unsent apology vs. pride—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens exactly once: the condensation vision forecloses the option to keep believing the letter was unread. Price is visible—Kael’s sob and the sudden weightlessness—so cost legibility meets the 600-word threshold. Agency is interior but still causal: he chooses to witness Lena’s pre-forgiveness, which rewrites his future stance. External coincidence never intervenes; pressure stays coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she convert shared dread into mutual safety—signals early and tightens with each decoded smudge. Mid-story “Will the dark stay forever?” forces her to decide whether to speak the answer she once dodged; this narrows her options from silent observer to vocal protector. Cost is visible: she pays with the armor of detachment she has worn since the camp. Escalation is textural—density of deciphered symbols increases until refusal to speak becomes impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—the recovery of lost joy—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the fresco blooms, foreclosing the option of permanent loss. No external antagonist or reversal is needed; pressure is the fading beam and dissolving fog that force the moment of integration. Cost is the recognition that joy exists only in honoring impermanence, paid in quiet tears. Agency is pure attention and display, sufficient under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—certainty versus curiosity—tightens through three nested intensifications: archival “pastoral” dissolves into musical score, Elias’s ghost pressures her methodology, her own legacy lust is exposed. Each tightening is agency-driven under the Accumulative lens: she angles the coin, chooses to re-bury it, rewrites her journal. Cost is legible in the cooled, returned nickel and the stripped journal page; the path of authoritative “solution” is foreclosed. No coincidence resolves; even the droplet is positioned by her earlier stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“untaxed thought”—is signaled inside 40 words and intensifies when moonrise forces the go/no-go moment. Agency is clear: Aris plants, codes, and will shake; escalation is the tightening sirens plus biologically-impossible cicadas that narrow escape options. Cost is legible (“dawn would bring risk”), though the state’s counter-move remains abstract, capping the pressure just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can insomnia be transmuted into communion rather than torment?—tightens once, when the shell answers his song. That tightening forecloses the old tactic of mute endurance and forces a new stance: active duet with the wind. Cost is visible on-page: the galaxy postcard dissolves, surrendering his last physical link to the outside cosmos, a price paid in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve identities from absolute silence—is signaled early and tightened by the cracked tube’s indispensability: without its fracture the authentic resonance is impossible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the altered duet splits memory from mourning, forcing Elara to house both in separate orchids—an irreversible allocation of sonic real estate. Price is felt in the lingering foxglove ache that irradiates each bloom; no coincidence intervenes. Escalation is accumulative/textural, not causal-reversal, and suffices for this lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before council divides paths—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the literal dawn deadline. Agency is continuous: each promise traced is an irreversible bet that either illuminates the next knot or leaves her in darkness; the ink’s refusal to glow would doom the effort, but it never cheats her. The triad paradox acts as the single meaningful escalation, narrowing options to one final glyph; cost is visible in her hammering heart and the ink flares that consume time. No external antagonist, but internal risk of permanent relational fracture keeps pressure coherent. The final sentence reweights trust from personal to institutional, landing the cost on both future and past.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reverence vs survival—is announced early, but pressure plateaus after cipher reveal; no secondary tightening forces a harder trade-off. Kael’s agency is procedural (place vents, watch steam) rather than a stance that forecloses a path with visible cost. Escalation is atmospheric (mountain exhale) not tactical; coincidence of perfect vent alignment resolves tension without new complication. Cost is aesthetic (assurance carvings stay dry) not personal—he loses nothing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving vs. speaking the lost songs—tightens once: the dust vortex forces public confession, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is legible: the written sentence ends twenty years of erasure. Agency is internal yet decisive; no coincidence resolves anything. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understand sacred thresholds—tightens once when prism light reveals spiral grain, forcing recognition of “necessary distance.” No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates via pattern recognition; cost is the irreversible absence of the mother reframed as sacred distance, felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—belonging—tightens from abstract longing to practiced witnessing; dawn clock supplies external pressure. Single meaningful deepening occurs when hairline crack redirects her climb, foreclosing passive vigil. Cost is the relinquishing of the last relic, felt on-page. One-step escalation suffices for lyric/accumulative design; could use slightly sharper intermediate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“why paths vanish”—is signaled early; each seed test is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the possibility of eternal preservation and forces acceptance of release. Agency is sustained; no reversal is needed under Accumulative lens—density of emotional colors reweights cost. Visible price: her own memory still fading, she forfeits the comfort of permanent archive.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—inject wonder into routine—is legible early; escalation is the single, irreversible tightening when the planned light-beam hits, forcing the man to choose engagement over despair; the price is Corbin’s loss of the bishop and the exhaustion of that site’s future magic. Agency resides in Corbin’s placement and the stranger’s kneel; no external savior intervenes. Coincidence is architected, not rescuing. The flash reframes sorrow into fragile recognition, fulfilling the stated objective with visible emotional cost on both parties.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver a verse that defeats the nostalgia ban—tightens once: the moment moonstone flares, Elara’s exile forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: relic dissolves, anchor releases. Agency is accumulative: each gap-observation adds density until the single decisive act. Under lyric lens, escalation is legible as cadence shift, not reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will she extract meaning from mundane transience?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density: each ring stanza deepens the text until spectral light fuses with water. No external antagonist or reversal, but accumulative tightening forecloses passive spectatorship; cost is the lifelong covenant of attentive labor. Sufficient for lyric mode at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stake—“revitalize a timeline”—is declared early but never tightens; no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from Elara. Escalation is textural: each successful balloon adds density, not risk. The village awakening is charming but happens off-stage, so pressure stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—will she shoulder the walls’ dreams—tightens once: from detached observation to irrevocable covenant when she seals the fragments. Agency is continuous: every beat is her active unearthing, deciphering, holding the negative to light, deciding to carry. Cost is visible on-page in the final third—“heart heavier yet clearer,” “whispered to the stones”—foreclosing the path of casual curiosity. Under Accumulative lens the pressure escalates by density of found artifacts rather than external opposition, a legitimate short-form intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can Kaelen convert personal guilt into viable peace—tightens when his confession narrows options from negotiation to self-exile; this single deepening satisfies Causal escalation. Pressure is coherent: every delegate scoff or spit tests his gentle attribute. Renunciation costs his post and legacy, a visible price. Conflict never loops; each beat either corroborates or challenges the ritual’s credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the land be forced to remember what he erased—tightens once: the egg must be exposed, not buried, aligning personal memory with public scar. The northern crack axis narrows options to a single alignment, a visible trade-off. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal stance crystallizing under situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate silenced voices—tightens when each untangling forecloses a future of forgetting. One meaningful deepening: the foundational lie knot fuses collective memory and coercion; severing it narrows Elara’s physical option (hands tremble, sweat freezes). Cost is visible: frost on skin, mental syrup, final exhaustion. No reversal, but accumulative pressure crystallizes into the resonant release of echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—who owns narrative power—tightens once: from puppet auteur to humble scribe; cost is conceptual (loss of curated moral authority) rather than visceral, but legible. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational: the emptied dome enforces listening. Escalation is modest yet sufficient for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—tightens when celebrated monarch suddenly needs the forgotten moth; options narrow from symbolic ritual to irreversible material sacrifice. Escalation is single-wave, not compounded, but agency remains hers. Cost is legible: she forfeits her pristine archival relic and the structures’ communicative integrity. Could use one earlier obstacle to push stakes past 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve names before eternal silence—is signaled in line 42 and tightens when the rope’s final strand clicks; failure means permanent erasure. One meaningful deepening: the shift from solitary guilt to communal stewardship as names cascade outward. Cost is visible: the rope’s new glow is “steady,” implying perpetual vigilance she must now keep. Agency is hers alone; coincidence merely complicates (aurora timing feels mythic, not convenient).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—access the now before the seal rots—locks to a live 40-minute storm clock that narrows to one irreversible act. Escalation is accumulative: each drop of humidity deepens density until transcendence becomes the only tactic left. The price (blank parchment, permanent perceptual rewiring) is legible on the final line; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are signaled—“seal a covenant with the unknown”—but pressure plateaus: no failed alignments, ticking clock, or external threat complicates the attempt. The single tightening is the final rotation; because no prior option is foreclosed, escalation is more mood-deepening than option-narrowing. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will resentment release?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened through each recovered sensory fragment. The penultimate turn narrows options: accept the pin’s impossible return or cling to the fracture; the choice crystallizes stance with felt cost (tear, exhaled breath). Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of remembered sensations reweights the stake until bitterness can no longer coexist. No coincidence resolves; the pin’s return is rule-bound by the shifting reality already taught.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—restore the astronomer’s fugitive dream—are signaled in paragraph two and tighten as frost shimmer approaches. One meaningful deepening: synchronization shifts from technique to shared pulse, foreclosing failure. Cost is visible in bodily stillness and the orchard’s claimed gratitude. Could use one more tactile risk (cut finger, drained breath) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—risking guild expulsion to unlock cameo—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when she steps outside, physically crossing the boundary of permitted action. One meaningful deepening: realization that she must give, not take, forecloses the earlier extraction tactic and exposes her to potential overdose of foreign memories. Cost visible: frozen tears, warm shell, glowing ledger—each image marks irreversible change. Coincidence absent; escalation is internal stance shift that reconfigures external outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save Kael by learning from gaps—tightens when the torn harmony-ivy page forces Elara to voice fear, narrowing options to brutal honesty. Cost is visible: perpetual stewardship of unlearned lessons. Escalation under causal lens: because she admits lack, therefore vine grows, therefore Warden yields. One beat shy of second tightening for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“will she haul Kael back or let him go?”—tightens once: the journal redefines the garden as internal, collapsing retrieval into release. Agency is renunciation rather than external battle, fitting situational lens. Cost is the card and the identity of seeker; visible on page. Could use one earlier material loss to sharpen tactics, but sufficient for 600-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“heal the schism or live with a lie in the archive”—is signaled by the anomalous door and tightens when the seal motif is touched. Single meaningful escalation: re-weaving the governance braid forecloses the option to leave the void blank; cost is the audible silence after gears stop. Pressure is coherent under causal lens, though the external world never pushes back; all tension is conceptual, sufficient for this length but not multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is visceral from line 1; escalation occurs via density of sensory assault until the decisive inversion of the stone. One meaningful tightening: pulse-driven noise becomes marrow-deep pain, eliminating avoidance options and forcing descent to Glacial Heart. Cost is visible (stone spent, Kael exhausted, caves permanently re-tuned). Agency resides in the act of listening/acknowledging rather than force, coherent with Accumulative lens. Could edge higher if an earlier irretrievable loss were shown.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove alignments are intentional”—is signaled in paragraph four and sharpened by external mockery. Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged astrolabe, each dismissed scoff, thickens the cost layer until the conjunction narrows options to one brittle prism angle. The tightening is single but meaningful; failure would confirm nihilism. Price is visceral—thirty years plus the momentary total sensory void—so the alignment’s success feels purchased, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she keep collective memory alive once the forecourt is silence?—is signaled by line 5. Escalation is textural: each lightning flash engraves more of her vigil into the fog, tightening the obligation to finish the page before dawn. The decisive deepening occurs when she chooses to write the *longing* itself, not just data, narrowing options from observer to participant. Cost is visible: ink depleted, solitude surrendered, archive relocated skyward.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—defy color-leeching despair—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: flame reveals hidden design, foreclosing ignorance; cost is the consumed rag knot and the new burden of execution. Pressure is ambient, not adversarial; escalation is a cadence shift from sensory overload to focused blueprint—sufficient for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can sibling trust be re-earned during one tide cycle. Pressure escalates via sensory accumulation—each exposed shell, anemone bloom, and tear reframes silence as necessary incubation rather than rejection. The crab’s shell-swap is the visible tightening that foreshadows Kael’s own; when he whispers “too tight,” the external image reweights their shared history with irrevocable cost. No reversal is required; the deepening of shared attention suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“capture boundless peace to counter dread”—tightens when gravity inversion offers one-hour window. Agency: she limits sensory input to become “pure vessel,” then releases doll to seal conversion. Cost legible: surrender of fear-talisman; persistent constraint of future dread remains, now re-weighted. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“Will Leo accept stillness or stay trapped in noise-denial?”—tightens once, when the sky-lark note converts absence into presence. Escalation is textural: crystalline formations clear, heartbeats synchronize; the tightening is legible and irreversible. Agency is chiefly Elara’s calibrated guidance, yet the cost (grief now fused with silence) lands on Leo, satisfying lens requirements. Falls short of 8.8 because no secondary option is explicitly foreclosed; the win feels inevitable rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reach the stairway before sunrise—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each peeled layer; the clock visibly alters her tactics (faster scraping, breath-held motion). Cost is legible: she forfeits personal ascension and exhausts the artifact. No reversal, but the single meaningful tightening is sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: keep the sanctuary inviolate vs. answer the suffocating other. Escalation is a single deepening: the translucent threshold forces her to risk self-contamination. Cost is legible—the once-sealed scar is reopened and remains open, door unlocked in spirit though physically closed. Agency is interior (breath guidance) but forecloses reunion, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“translate pressure into meaning”—is signaled early and tightened when she alone steps into the Heartroot chamber. Agency drives escalation: volunteer → press bolt → lose anchor; cost is the very object she clung to. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth before dynastic duty crushes her—threads every beat; dust lattice is the tightening fulcrum that forecloses ignorance. Agency is high: she acts (aligns crank, slides book) and pays the quiet cost of identity dissolution. No coincidence; pressure grows via pattern recognition rather than external opposition. Could use one more intermediate beat where the method almost fails to make the price viscerally sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture possibility’s shape”—is signaled early; pressure mounts when geometry warps and only the clasp-release survives as live option. One meaningful tightening: pivot beneath sorrowwood → mercury freeze → east bow → clasp; each move forecloses alternatives. Cost is the knight’s fixed identity; felt in the universe-sigh and puppet slack.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—will the erased be re-seen?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens exactly once: when the ripples lock Venus to willow, foreclosing any alternate route. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each successful unlock (key, panel, signal bloom) simultaneously increases both reach and exposure, a linked rise in payoff and peril. No reversal is needed; the single decisive tightening satisfies short-form economy. The price—her imminent arrest—is visible in the final crunch of gravel, but because the consequence is still incoming rather than felt, the score stops just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—valley peace versus coded prophecy—signalled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the dew-drop clock. Agency is Elias’s musical pauses; each silence frays the prophecy further, a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist, but the tension escalates through sensory feedback (light coalescing, dew forming) that forces precise timing. Cost is the absolute silence he must inhabit forever after; option set is reweighted—he carries the hush, a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: decode leaf-messages to keep memory alive. Pressure tightens once: silver-veined hand-leaf arrives, foreclosing passive cataloging. Cost visible—moonstone lost forever, her lap empty yet palms open. Agency is attention/renunciation, not victory; suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover compass vs. need for control—tightens once when she chooses surrender over force. Escalation is textural: each leaf swirl, metal latch, mist drop accumulates pressure. Agency is present but externalized; waterfall “gives” direction rather than her action creating new option. Cost is conceptual, felt, yet not a forfeiture that alters later tactics on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redeem the moment of failure—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via material risk: starlight may fail, crucible may shatter again, pride may re-fracture. Tightening occurs when she speaks Kael’s name and the forge floods with auditory ghosts; this forecloses denial and forces restitution. Cost is legible: the mended vessel glows with perpetual reminder—future apprentices will see her flaw literally gilt.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Elara weave laughter into a thirty-year knot of regret? Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern—each dissonant note tightens the emotional field until the whimsical “hiccup” pluck flips the register, forcing Cora’s stance to shift. Cost is visible: the ghost’s dissolution leaves Elara alone with the weighted silence, path foreclosed. Agency remains with Elara throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—quantify mercy or remain haunted—tightens through each mined memory: hesitation coefficient → kindness integer → recursive love function. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the internal requirement to solve before movement becomes impossible. Visible price: every braced flinch costs physical stamina and social connection (“ghost haunting society’s edges”). Escalation obeys Accumulative logic: density of data, not narrowing options, but the stakes still feel higher because failure means eternal self-exile.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“resurrect Hemlock’s humanity”—tightens once per painting until the shard’s surrender forecloses her keeping it. No antagonist; pressure is ontological erasure. One visible price: loss of the fragment she once clutched. Escalation is accumulative densification, coherent under Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten from idle curiosity to covenant with the dead; the synchronized light-failure acts as irreversible pivot that forces Leo’s promise, foreclosing passive observation with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—compress eternity without shattering the library—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation follows accumulative pattern: each frost reading tightens temporal alignment; uncorking raises entropy cost; rupture forecloses perfect stasis option. Price visible: whisper spent, cracks permanent, Elara isolated. No external antagonist needed; system pressure suffices under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen dawn—is signaled early and tightens at the midnight clock strike. Escalation is causal: each key turn increases bodily cost (wilting → collapse) while narrowing options to a single chord of truth. No coincidence; the protagonist’s sustained turn of the key physically frees the light. Price is visible and persistent (chamber echo, bodily exhaustion).

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—find where explanations fail—tightens when compass needle denies north and lagoon denies reflection, forcing surrender. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed. Visible cost: she abandons her professional currency (scent vial) and future bragging rights. Could use one earlier micro-choice under pressure to hit 8+ band.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collector’s refusal to collect: surrender to awe is dramatized, not preached. Final reweighting of mapping/safety trope is inevitable yet non-moralizing. One soft spot: Thorne’s journal line “seeking only truth” flirts with thematic echo, but it’s buried mid-text and doesn’t replace closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find direction without GPS—tightens when storm intensifies and ancestral slide becomes sole map. Escalation is textural: each turbine reverberation layers historical time onto present danger, forcing finer carving focus. Middle deepening: lightning flash + slide projection fuses past star chart to present stone, narrowing options to “cut along ancestor lines.” Cost paid: she permanently abandons electronic navigation; turbine’s final hum ratifies the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the suppressed truth of Anya’s escape—tightens when Elias realises the patrol-direction error and must intervene without voice or touch. One meaningful escalation: the distant crunch of boots raises physical jeopardy, forcing the phantom stone-push that narrows options to “act silently or let her die.” Cost is legible: searing bodily immersion leaves him gasping and weeping, a price that alters his archival stance. Agency remains causal under the chosen lens; no coincidences resolve the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can memory replace magic?—is signaled early. Escalation is incremental: each recalled artisan skill tightens the blueprint until the greenhouse sketch forecloses the old wish-altar path. No reversal, but a coherent because/therefore narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve emotional resonance—sharpens when silence mutates from absence to fertile medium, a single but meaningful tightening. No external antagonist needed: the pressure is ontological, forcing her to trade archiving for cultivation. Cost is felt—the scriptorium abandoned, future labor unmapped—yet the price could be even more viscerally tethered to body or social standing. Still, agency is hers: she chooses descent into the Great Silence, foreclosing safe cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will she feel borrowed time or fail?”—tightens once via the entropy ritual; failure means eternal sterile winter. Agency is pure: every seed placed decreases options until the final petal proves success. Cost is knowledge that spring is now her perpetual debt. No secondary pressure or antagonist, but at this length one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—community safety versus truth—tightens through each data beat; calm high-pressure system forecloses the ritual option with measurable on-page evidence. Single meaningful turn suffices: the refusal at zero-hour crystallizes stance and carries institutional cost (potential loss of faith in prophecy). Pressure stays coherent; no escalation slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is declared early and reasserted at closure, but no middle beat tests or narrows that abstraction. The meteor shower intensifies mood, not options; pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical. No visible price is paid or foreclosed. Escalation is therefore a cadence shift, not a causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stake—“preserve unspoken weight”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies once, when Elias’s ghost turns gaze onto the recluse, reweighting the keeper’s duty from passive vigil to completed bridge; the cost is the lifelong solitude now crystallized, meeting the single-deepening bar for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transmit tactile time before borrowed hours expire—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Kael presses the glyph and feels his remaining texture, but escalation is mostly imagistic rather than a narrowing of options; Elara’s arrival is external coincidence. Sufficient for the length, yet the reversible shift from “timeless sea” to garage-sale card lacks a visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—“find beauty in the incomplete”—is declared early; the severed kite supplies the single tightening beat. Yet Elara’s agency is purely receptive: she watches, walks, picks up, writes. No option is foreclosed, no price exacted; the tension plateaus rather than escalates. Sufficient for short-form accumulative design but below the 8.2 threshold where cost must shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore interspecies covenant before death—is signaled early and tightens through each pillar-oak pairing. No external opposition appears; pressure is the ticking six-month clock and Kael’s failing breath. The final network illumination is a conceptual price paid by his extinction, but because the orchard offers zero resistance, escalation is a smooth ramp rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“isolate the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the basin resin mirrors her amber, forcing ideological surrender. One meaningful turn: the adversary’s tears convert opposition into shared awe, narrowing future options (they must now carry forbidden knowledge). Cost is legible: institutional credibility lost, secrecy assumed. Escalation is causal, not additive spectacle; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—garden as amendment to broken peace—is signaled early and deepens through each bird injunction; pressure is accumulative, not causal, and narrows to the final watering. No external opposition or internal counter-want, so escalation is a cadence shift rather than option foreclosure. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, limiting entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: the cylinder offers a literal bridge to Elara, turning memory into a directional path. The deepening is driven by Kael’s agency: he rejects Elder Anya, tries and fails with every tool, then risks grief by holding the leaf-filter to the light—an irrevocable narrowing from stasis to pursuit. Cost is visible—retirement vow broken, safety forfeited—but not as viscerally felt as the thematic ache; a sharper physical price (bleeding knuckle on jagged metal, thirst acknowledged in tomorrow’s desert) would have secured the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“will she remain a memorializer or become an active navigator?”—tightens the instant the sky fractures to reveal the Lyre. That one beat forces a trade-off: continue safe grief-work or risk investing future anniversaries in an unproven chase. The cost is legible: perpetual solitude on a dead station with no guarantee of further signals. Escalation is single-turn but sufficient for the word count; coincidence complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—heal the sky or leave world nauseating—signaled in first 120 words. Each piece-switch escalates by shrinking the violet-green lesion and increasing spire instability, a because/therefore loop. One meaningful tightening: the healer-queen swap triggers golden eruption that forces final gardener-king placement under collapsing ceiling. Cost is cumulative frostbite risk and irreversible identity shift from taker to restorer, visible in closing lid-glow.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transmuting private trauma into collective memory—tightens each time a new word is spelled, narrowing her option to stop. Benevolent ruthlessness creates internal friction that escalates cost: she must keep extracting even when it wounds. One deepening: the shift from solitary witness to vessels in the penumbra, foreclosing her anonymity. Price is legible—she forfeits rest and assumes perpetual custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled in line 69 and tightens when the stone demands a raw memory. Escalation is textural: each handled object increases emotional voltage until renunciation of illusion becomes the only viable stance. Cost is visible: tears, the abandoned glass, the narrow upward path. Slight reserve: the external world beyond the mountain never pressures back, so stakes remain internally bounded.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when each decoded thread mirrors the Scholar’s Mate defense he omitted. One decisive turn: the moonlight thread tug that activates the lock and restarts time; option to remain frozen in guilt is foreclosed. Cost is audible—the village’s resumed hammer and laughter make his past isolation irreversible. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will single truth prevail—tightens when Elder Borin confronts; Elara’s refract or silence becomes irreversible stance. One meaningful escalation: community’s rigid anger softens into shared complicity after second stanza, narrowing options to plural forgiveness. Cost visible in stonemason’s tears and Borin’s conceded amendment. Agency is Elara’s public recital that forces collective reframing; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before annihilation—signaled line 4; pressure tightens via each gold seam until the mirror-calm sea externalizes the internal shift. One meaningful deepening: heart-pockmark beat narrows options to remember wholeness, not breaking. No external coincidence resolves; agency is the ritual narration itself. Cost legible: workshop still doomed, peace purchased.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled early and tested once: the scent’s arrival in Silas’s tea-kettle memory tightens the stake by validating the theory with witnessed cost (Silas’s tears, audible hush). No reversals needed; one meaningful deepening sufficient. Agency lies in Elias’s controlled release, not external rescue. Coincidence is absent; the transmission succeeds through causality of wind and olfaction.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: gentleness as transmissive force versus coercive volume. Subtext resides in sensory substitution—smell replacing sound—rendered without thematic lecture. Final image of fishing boat guided by “gentle beam and memory of a whisper” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: Silas’s awe contains humiliation, Elias’s victory tastes of private loss.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim love’s essence through grief’s terrain—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: “Complete the circuit” forces the final solder joint that forecloses denial. No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational-moon-phase and accumulative-memory. The price is the irreversibility of loss—station remains broken, calls end—made legible on the last page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; escalation coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivate safety for Lena—is signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure tightens once: the checkpoint forces blunt honesty that could have seized the relic; success narrows future options to ritual attempt. Cost is legible: permanent visibility of smuggling risk, possible ritual failure. No coincidence; storm complicates but also enables truffle formation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode gesture vs. preserve solitude—tightens when the alpine flower’s foreignness forces Silas to confront his own coastal exile. One meaningful deepening: recognition that token is preserved relic, not fresh farewell, narrows options from interpretation to witness. Cost is legible: he forfeits detachment by archiving the memory. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, fitting situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“honor the promise before the creek swells”—is signaled early and escalates through water seeping into boots, narrowing passages, and time collapsing to “tightening coil.” The ant-guided ramp is the single meaningful tightening that forecloses every other route. Felt price is the soaked boots and the irreversible transfer of chip energy.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“mend the tear within herself or all light fades”—tightens at the ledge when the fox stare costs her breath and secrecy. Escalation is accumulative: each upward yard strips one layer of ceremonial armor, narrowing her options until the grotto confrontation. Cost is visible: discarded cloak, thinning air, bleeding starlight drunk by obsidian—material prices paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara chooses to intervene rather than witness. The intervention carries conceptual risk (contaminating the moment) but no tangible price or foreclosed option; stakes deepen emotionally yet lack material cost. Pressure accumulates chromatically under Accumulative lens. No escalation artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stake—render mortality legible through narrative—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each spectral self tightens the emotional vise until the younger Elias’s wave collapses jealousy into wonder, foreclosing despair without resetting mortality. Cost is felt via the tear-tracked release, though no durable external constraint is imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore midwife’s tool before sunrise—tightens once when screw threads engage; option of failure foreclosed by audible click. Pressure accumulates through drip-cadence and tactile obstacles: stripped screw, worn hinge, occluded sight. Protagonist agency drives every micro-turn; no coincidence. Cost: permanent sensory loss acknowledged in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transform scars or remain defined by them—is signaled in paragraph four and tested when the ink crystallizes. One meaningful tightening: the quiver wrist narrows options to either abort or release via tear; no coincidence rescues her. The price is the permanent glowing narrative on her palm, a social and bodily cost that can’t be undone. Escalation is causal under stress-attribute rules, not repeated loops.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before orchard severance—tightens when loggers’ first axe hits at the end, paying the visible cost. One meaningful deepening: the jasmine vapor shifts Valerius from accusatory shimmer to warm acceptance, foreclosing Elara’s option to flee without giving the apology. Pressure accumulates texturally under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Persistent constraint: once perfume is uncorked, it cannot be recaptured, charging every subsequent chord with scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save meaning from eternal falsification—ramps via each lexical wobble; "hope/despair → resignation" is the sharpest tightening, forcing her to coin "yearning." Cost is conceptual but legible: she exits as eternal custodian, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—grasping time’s true measure—tightens once via the countdown ritual that forecloses normal perception; the price is the irreversible softening of the razor horizon. Escalation is textural (density of image and sound) rather than causal reversal, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she let grief pass without alarm?—is signaled early and deepened once when Kael reframes permeability. The laser test is the single tightening beat; it forecloses the old “harden perimeter” stance with visible symbolic cost (tear). Pressure is coherent but solitary; no external antagonist or resource loss amplifies it further.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—“widening perspectives responsibly”—stay thematic; the only tightening is the lantern’s reveal, not a forfeited option. Pressure is situational and lyric: the city offers clues, never penalizes. No visible cost is exacted; escalation is a mood deepen, not a door slam.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can a grief-loop become forward motion?—tightens once: the caller’s confession escalates from “emptier” to “space feels like a beginning” triggered by her micro-intervention. Escalation is causal under lens: her humming is agency that re-prices the silence from void to rest. Cost is legible: she forfeits her own exit, stays inside the loop to keep enabling others’. One meaningful turn suffices at 732 words; no artificial reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release sorrow while preserving small moments—tightens once via the handwritten covenant; option to keep grief “as stones” is foreclosed by the wind-seal act. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, appropriate under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legible in the shifted chest-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Loneliness-as-stake is signaled early and tightens when the stranger appears; the act of passing the stone is the visible price that narrows Elara’s future path. Pressure grows under Situational lens: isolation collides with offered connection. One meaningful deepening suffices. Could use one more external obstacle beat to hit 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—grief navigation—signaled early; pressure tightens via rising sensory density until silence delivers irreversible shift. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates through accumulating notes that demand integration. Cost legible: ring’s heat loss and “sharp edges softened.” One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; meets 8.8 gate for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from her catastrophic misread—signals early and tightens when straightening the nib forces a trade-off: retain rigid shame or accept distributed blame. Agency is present: the physical act of unbending forecloses the option of eternal self-condemnation and triggers the record-edit. Cost is visible—her frozen tear and the pen’s hum—satisfying short-form price requirement. One micro-turn suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is Elias’s need to turn silence into music before memory erases him; pressure grows as no one witnesses his ritual. No external antagonist; tension is density of resisted erasure. One decisive deepening—Lily’s arrival—re-weights stakes: performance becomes gift, not therapy. Cost stakes stay modest (continued solitude vs. connection) for 700-word scope; escalation credible, not extravagant.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—heal the valley or fail Elara—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the scar-notation forces a public act of song. One meaningful deepening: the act of “portray” shifts from self-image to sonic revelation, foreclosing anonymity with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“breathe life into the shared dream”—is signaled in first third. Mid-story tightening: the dream coalesces for three heartbeats, foreclosing the option of permanent restoration and making the final loss felt. Escalation is textural: each drummed surface adds harmonic density until the pattern breaks into dissolution, reweighting the stake from success to stewardship. Cost is the audible seed-chime that will demand tomorrow’s stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—validate quiet method—tightens when Vale’s shouting failure makes the labyrinth appear hostile; Kael’s whispered counter-move narrows options to “soft or fail.” Storm amplification is coincidence that complicates, not saves; the acoustic trick succeeds only because Kael earlier mapped the fold. Cost is legible: Vale’s awestruck silence confirms Kael’s ethos yet forecloses future collaboration, a social price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the town pause to think?”—is signaled early. Pressure rises accumulation-style as displays multiply, but the tightening is observational, not a forced choice that costs Elias a concrete forfeiture. The reversal (gruff adults stop, kneel, wonder) is presented as fait accompli rather than tested obstacle. No visible price alters Elias’s tactics; the rebellion succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“freedom through embracing true nature”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once when she surrenders the memory of the cutlass; cost is the scrimshaw itself. Because the external world offers no opposing force beyond memory echoes, pressure is situational/accumulative rather than causal escalation; tension crests at the island appearance, then deliberately softens. Agency is renunciation rather than decision in scene; the missing present-tense temptation to violence keeps the tightening abstract. Still, the final image of wading back “whole” forecloses retreat to piracy, satisfying the minimal escalation bar for lyric short form.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can he trade mandated mask for sustainable grief?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through pattern break: narration flips from stage rhetoric to prayer as blade slips. Cost is legible: blood, relinquished mask, sparrow lodged in dead flowers. One tightening suffices for 700-word piece; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in imperfection”—tightens through tactile confrontations: Elara cups the “failure” sphere, Kael risks breath on a broken reed. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bubble-laden sphere is re-read as phoenix breath, foreclosing Kael’s perfectionism. Agency is mutual: her gift demands his breath; his note gifts her synesthetic sight. Price visible—the shard-littered courtyard and the reed’s fragile song—charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mending silence through reciprocal vulnerability—tightens when Elara’s prism-song deliberately crashes the sensors, trading archival certainty for emotional risk; the price (public failure, tear-stained cheeks) is legible on the page and irreversible under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Elara rekindle meaning after Lena’s death? Pressure tightens via each origami drop, narrowing avoidance options until telescope forces confrontation. Bioluminescent grove discovery = irreversible escalation; no deus-ex machina—coordinates stem from vellum planted early. Felt price: softened grief replaces numb security, visible in tear-warmed cheeks and locket left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can mapping absorb grief without depleting the mapper?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each added ink branch tightens the vellum like skin, making the map’s own fragility the rising cost. Leo’s arrival complicates but does not resolve; the final rip of parchment is the first irreversible price, small yet legible. No large reversal, yet the tightening from observation to donation is sufficient for 800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent her people’s collapse via forbidden knowledge—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates when she recognizes the Aethel council’s mirror folly. The tightening beat is the core atom’s anguished joy landing in her own chest; options narrow from scholarly detachment to guardian burden. Cost is paid on-page: innocence fractured, veil damp with sweat, tears carving clean paths. Steadily unpredictable method keeps pressure alive—each purification path unique—but the method itself is not tested beyond success, so ceiling stays mid-8.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve hope’s shape”—is signaled early and deepened when footage reveals the shadow as catalyst, forcing Elara toward surrender. One meaningful tightening: the stone warms and blooms, paying visible cost. Shadow-as-complication is external but agency remains hers to release the talisman. Could edge higher if a concrete tactical loss (e.g., forfeited archive key) had been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—balance compassion with self-protection—signaled at 110 and tightens through each shedding beat, culminating in the workshop redesign that costs her open-door ease. Agency is interior but visible: spoken words, visualization, and the physical latch sketch each foreclose prior openness. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational/internal yet coherent and escalating. Cost is legible: eternal vigilance replaces unconditional welcome.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she keep prying wounds open?—is signaled early. Single tightening occurs when the root-tunnel vision reframes scar-as-pathway, forcing renunciation. Cost is legible (loss of old investigative method, acceptance of alien telepathy). Escalation is modest—one accretive turn, not a causal squeeze—so stays below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—is signaled in line 12 and tightens once: from seeking a location to accepting it resides in negative space. The renunciation (returning the strip) forecloses further search with visible cost under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the quest. Pressure accumulates through sensory layering until the busker’s lyric triggers the culminating reframe. A hairline short of 9+ only because the escalation is single-wave rather than compounding, but cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity—signals in paragraph four and escalates via each meteor traced; the tightening is the memory flood that forces her to accept grief as fuel. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive. Cost is visible: tears blur stars, knees cold against stone, final “Rest” forecloses continued silence. One meaningful intensification suffices; coincidence (aurora timing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—seed light into void—is signaled early and tightens once: hollow resists glow, forcing focused charm. Stakes remain abstract (“fragile light vs. void”) rather than personal; no fear that guard himself might extinguish. Escalation is textural—density of blooms increases—but options don’t narrow; same method repeats. Cost is offloaded to future children; guard loses nothing concrete now.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“restore harmony the sixth sense alone perceives”—is declared early but never sharpened into tangible loss. Escalation is tonal, not tactical: each wind-song adds texture; no option is foreclosed. The gear insertion resolves tension that was never dramatized as imminent danger. Absence of visible cost caps pressure at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—locate buried courage—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through cadence, not plot reversals. Each detour adds a star, increasing symbolic cost; the final imprint coincides with internal ignition. Agency is present—each step is chosen, not forced—yet pressure is lyrical, not tactical. One meaningful deepening (memory of mother’s song) reweights the stake just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—guilt versus acoustic obedience—tightens when discoloration offers actionable rebellion; silence option narrows to zero once she presses the stone. Bolt discovery reweights safety myth with irreversible cost, forcing open-door stance. Agency drives each escalatory beat; coincidence absent. Pressure intensifies once, sufficient for 800-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. lie—signals early and tightens through cumulative inscription acts; each rune sliver spent is an irreversible debit against Kael’s finite pellet. Pressure escalates texturally: the pellet shrinks, constellations wheel, books vanish, until the harmonic chord manifests the cost off-stage in the throne room. No live antagonist appears, so the tension is durational rather than confrontational; the reader feels the drain of time rather than a narrowing of tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—tightens when ecological silence is revealed as the true eraser, not mere submersion. The midpoint micro-turn (AI overlay swapping land for life-routes) escalates pressure by reframing her life’s work from cataloguing loss to decoding silence. Cost is visible: the station’s purpose pivots in real time, her grief retroactively misaimed. No false cliffhanger; the final tap series forecloses passive monitoring and commits her to sonic cartography.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and deepens when the lull is re-priced from surrender to sacred pause. Escalation is accretive: each sensory beat (cold, hum, memory) raises the cost of retreat. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological. The final quiet engine inside his chest is a felt price, though it could sharpen if an explicit tactical option were foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“evolve tradition with intent”—is signaled early and tightened when she rejects the “innocent child” clause. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the amber must be opened now for terraces to stabilize. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (finding kite) only complicates. Cost is the moral breach of ancestral decree, legible in her soft scoff and the valley’s held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can broken meaning be re-woven?”—is signaled early and tightened by each knot that narrows options until the obsidian spiral demands acceptance. Agency is continuous: every untangling act alters the hum and the walls’ pressure. Cost is visible as cold stone on shoulders and the final transformed ache he chooses to keep.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why does time slow?”—tightens when wind funnels ink into eclipse-mirrors; the single deepening (pattern recognition → drone sacrifice) forecloses rebuilding and carries felt cost, satisfying the one-turn requirement for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single stake—bury or release truth—tightens when boot-cracks intrude: transmit now or lose forever; agency is hers, price is instant complicity and lifelong secrecy, escalation crystallized in the soft chime.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—catch goddess echo—signaled in first paragraph; secondary grief stake braids at climax. Single meaningful tightening: driving spike into vortex forecloses capture and remakes her instead; price is surrender of original goal. Escalation is accumulative (density of broken harmonics) rather than causal reversal, fitting lens. Cost visible in cooling iron and permanent pulse of echo inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. family myth) is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through two concrete reversals: physical impossibility of the fall, then fabrication of weather. Each finding forecloses the “accident” option; the final choice to publish crystallizes the cost under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hush her own guilt-amplified dissonance—is signaled early and tightens when she recognizes the archived cry as her niece’s. The meaningful deepening is the micro-choice to hum rather than mute; it forecloses denial with on-page cost (guilt edges softened yet forever embedded in amber). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the haunted sound. Visible price: she pockets the cooled stone, perpetual reminder.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“find pattern in her unraveling”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the new anxious whisper threatens the hush; her counter-word forecloses retreat into mere release. Cost is the mandala’s erasure and the admission that chaos persists. Agency is cognitive yet causal under Accumulative lens: internal decision reshapes external acoustic.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether the plaza will remain a tomb or become a teacher—tightens once: the act of renaming forecloses the elders’ ideology of forgetting. Pressure is textural rather than causal: each sensory layer (ash, fractured sky, laughter drifting closer) deepens the cost of remaining frozen. Aberrant mercy is the visible price: she risks civic scorn to offer compassion a foothold. No visible resource loss (tool, stamina, coin) but the softening of traumatic memory is an undeniable internal forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the lost duet possibility—is signaled in paragraph four and every echo gathered tightens the cord, so pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens. One decisive intensification: when cherry-red balloon and sapphire tear lock into the braid, the timeline stills and the garden glows—options narrow to release or oblivion. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: Elara pays with self-dissolution, visible in "growing lighter." Could use an earlier tangible loss (a frayed sequin, a fading note) to raise the felt price sooner; that keeps it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Maya’s need for tangible connection—tightens when Elara decides to risk professional credibility by trusting bodily cues. One meaningful deepening: the recall notice turns the pill from background detail into live liability, raising cost. Escalation is accumulative: each somatic cue narrows the light-trail options until the willow silhouette crystallizes. Price is legible: Elara forfeits absolute proof, embraces subjective conduit role.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the world’s memory survive forgetting—tightens when the fossil’s levitation demands a new custodial plan. One meaningful deepening: the map shifts from private record to public beacon; options narrow to “hide it where others will feel it.” Cost is visible: she gives up possession for possible recognition. No reversal, but pressure coheres under accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—convert fatal prophecy into communal agency—signals early and tightens when the ceiling crack bleeds dust, forcing her to externalize the mosaic. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each button pair adds connective threads until the black-grain hover reweights risk. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is felt but lightly articulated—hence stops short of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—repair vs. self-erasure—tightens when the melting snow sets a live clock: the code will vanish with sun, forcing Elias to act before exposure. The prudently daring gesture (handing over the pillbox) forecloses suicide and costs him the safety of silence. Coincidence (Anya’s arrival) complicates rather than rescues; he still must vouchsafe the token under her gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—honor the “light” promise—tightens once: realization that light is portable, not valley-bound. Agency is attentional endurance; cost is surrendering the dream of geographic redemption. One meaningful deepening satisfies length; no external antagonist needed under accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why some ground refuses erasure—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates by pattern density: each remembered beekeeper-gesture tightens the equation “kindness = soil.” The single meaningful deepening occurs when saving-a-bee memory becomes the final stitch holding time against entropy; options narrow to either believe the evidence or succumb to wasteland nihilism. Cost is visible on-page: Kael’s breathing must now sustain the thrum rhythm—an embodied debt he carries into ash. No reversal, but accrual suffices under Accumulative lens; closure forecloses apathy as a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“reflect light into dark corners”—tightens through physical fatigue and the risk of being seen. One meaningful deepening: the sweep slows under shoulder ache, foreclosing longer ritual. Cost is visible on page (warm fatigue, thorn prick, velvet pouch). Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; suffices under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens once: the memory must be externalized or it will erode her. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the Whales’ departure was intentional, converting potential elegy into stewardship; this reframes her solitude from wound to vocation. Cost is legible: she forfeits the comfort of shared recognition, embracing lifelong archival labor. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure suffices and escalates under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—her need to locate “the thread”—is signaled early and tightened when she decides to externalize it into a public weave. The act of rejoin narrows her solitude: each visitor offering forecloses her exclusive keeper role and risks exposure. Cost is visible: she sacrifices secrecy, signs the installation with her own word. One meaningful escalation suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“outwit tricksters with resonance”—tightens when Croft’s memo forecloses legal broadcast, forcing the illegal hijack. The waveform’s visible softening is the decisive reversal; it narrows options by proving interference works, inviting retaliation. Cost is immediate: Dean’s approaching footsteps. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no abstract inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“awaken dormant empathy”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the journal’s private letter forecloses the possibility that Clara was abducted; the cost is the town’s collective grief re-opened. Escalation is accretive: each tactile discovery adds density until the ribbon-stone fusion forces Elara to carry a new, volatile story home. No fake reversals; luck complicates nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reversing Aris’s exile—converges with physical survival once the coded stanza maps onto the incoming tsunami. Pressure tightens exactly once: the discovery that the station sits atop the reef turns intellectual victory into mortal threat. Agency is intellectual rather than physical; the decisive act is to lay journal and nail on the console, forcing the technician’s belief. Cost is visible—the station is swallowed—yet the price is borne by infrastructure, not Elara’s body.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can music resurrect a dream pronounced “never”?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accumulating images: vanishing hitchhiker, glowing cracks, scaffold code. The tightening beat is the bow’s first note: it forecloses silence and costs him the safety of grief. Cost is felt but not given concrete consequence (no broken string, no audience rejection), keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why paths circle back”—is signaled early and tightened when Leo maps his father’s carving onto his own whiteboard ghost. The beat where he admits Aether used “algorithms instead of ambush” forces Kai (and Leo) to confront complicity, narrowing future options. Visible price: relinquishing the inherited banknotes. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient; no reversal for reversal’s sake.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode or surrender—tightens exactly once when Kael’s letter reframes dimming as invitation to rest, not failure. No reversals needed; single deepening suffices. Price is relinquishment of sole vigil; cost visible in her tears and subsequent testament. Agency is crystallized attention that chooses shared watch, foreclosing solitary path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—tightens when the only path forces her to feed her own shame to the plant. One meaningful escalation: the third circle reveals the frozen confession is hers, flipping external quest into internal exposure. Cost is visible—she ends with posture melted, twenty-year armor abandoned. Pressure stays causal under the single POV; no coincidence resolves the vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—mend the dream-tear or lose the earth’s covenant—tightens once: the maze-path narrows her options to pressing the clipping into the rift; cost is visible (burning birthmark, pouring scars) but external pressure stays mystical rather than tactical, keeping escalation just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trade his recklessness for her peace—signaled in graf 1 and escalates through each recalled kindness until the card ignites. Single micro-turn: wisp accepts offer, sorrow floods him; option to retreat vaporizes. Cost is irreversible bodily cold and permanent soul-patch. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim purpose after televised shame—is signaled by line 4. Pressure tightens once: the fact-ritual collapses under memory’s assault, forcing a new vocational vow. Cost is legible: he forfeits the validation pipeline he spent years building. The escalation is Accumulative/Textural—density of memory and object-meaning reweights options until the pen-stroke narrows them.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understand transition—tightens once: from failed capture to acceptance of connection. The seed’s insertion is the visible trade-off that forecloses instrument-based pursuit; magnetic stabilization is the felt price. Agency remains internal but sufficient for this length; coincidence absent. A second intermediate tightening beat would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stake is signaled as “preserve wonder in routine,” but no live option threatens that wonder; therefore escalation is purely atmospheric, not tactical. The single meaningful deepening occurs when shards fuse, yet Elara’s agency is acceptance rather than risk—pressure plateaus rather than narrows. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies lyrically, satisfying minimum tightening, but the absence of felt cost keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—dissolve walls between hearts—is signaled early and sharpened by each etched confession, tightening the moral calculus of private vs. shared grief. Agency is present in the deliberate crowning act that forecloses hoarding; cost is the permanent loss of the talisman and the exposed vulnerability of his own etched regret. Escalation is incremental rather than dramatic, but the pearl’s warming glow makes the price legible under the accretive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled in paragraph 2 and tightened when graffiti lines force confrontation; the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens. No secondary reversal, but the patched accordion becomes the visible price, foreclosing the “perfect restoration” path. Cost is legible: surrendering the annotated map = tangible forfeiture. Could use one earlier micro-loss (cut finger on gate?) to push into 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: seize ephemeral words before they vanish. Propagation delay tightens twice: first as transcription race, then as emotional heat on skin. The 3-second flicker forecloses perfect record—she must speak or lose everything. Cost is visible: mist stills when she chooses voice over safe silence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—tightens through accretion of irreversible physical loss: each second melts the violin, each coffee stain forecloses a future. The single propagating note is the decisive turn that narrows options from “preserve or play” to “play and lose,” with visible price (pool of water, extinct seed now green). Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates the thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture Kael’s essence before oblivion—is signaled in line 3 and tightens through sensory escalation rather than external opposition. The “threshold of stillness” acts as a live clock: missing it forecloses the option, visible in the mandala snap and auroral freeze. Agency is interiorized yet causal: Elara’s pattern-finding directly enables the infusion. Cost is legible in the vial’s added weight and her solitary descent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she release the last shard of resentment?—is signaled early and tightens when she decides the scallop is the physical act of release. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the accumulating weight of memory versus the irreversible tap of chisel. One meaningful deepening: the moment she chooses self-care over gifting the offender. Cost is legible in the permanent stone loss and the ache in her knees after descent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will Kael keep wearing blame?—is signaled early and tightens once through the chime-cued conversation until the unhooking forecloses retreat. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure is escalated by each new wind-chime “sentence” that contradicts his monolithic verdict. The price is visible: the cloak lost over the cliff and the shard surrendered to the sea. Coincidence is absent; the final harmony of chimes is earned by prior pattern, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he safely translate vanishing into teachable pattern without shattering students or himself—tightens when the spiral reveals love, not physics, as the core, forcing the compassionate withhold. Escalation is single, meaningful: ripples move from abstract data to personal grief, narrowing options to silence. Cost is visible: surrender of immediate catharsis and acceptance of future erasure of Elara’s adult face. Agency resides in the deliberate stone-throw that initiates irreversible insight.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“map without moving”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tested by the schism. Escalation is a single deepening: the flock’s split forces Corbin to integrate rather than direct; options narrow to “become the bridge or lose the Pulse.” Cost is embodied: eternal stillness accepted when he nests the arrowhead and lets dust claim it. Under Accumulative lens the density increase (echo + heartbeat + breath) reweights the stake to sacred stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“witness magic untouched by calculation”—tightens through pattern intensification: each impossibility (upward mercury, suspended snow) deepens the cost of extraction until refusal becomes the only non-hollowing option. The single meaningful turn is her kneeling release of memories; it narrows future paths without a second reversal, sufficient for 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove chromatic sound—tightens when the only remaining evidentiary vault (the library) threatens to flood with returning tide; the lanterns above act as ticking celestial lamps. Escalation is Accumulative: each bibliographic touch increments sensory density until the log’s page forces a stance crystallization. Cost is visible: the moment he reads “laughter…liquid topaz” his fortress of trivia shears away, tears acknowledged on page. Could edge higher if an external physical consequence (rising water, collapsing shelf) had punished delay, adding corporeal risk to emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—her need to verify that memory matters—tightens when static bursts threaten meaning. Escalation is textural: each decoded fragment adds density until the coin circle forces recognition that witness is the only role left. Visible price: she forfeits the hope of altering anything; the standing coin is both confirmation and life sentence. Cost is legible on page; meets 9+ quick test, but only one deepening, so 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“name the deepest fear or stay hollow”—is signaled early and tightened with each crystal birth; options narrow as light fades. Each naming costs Kael a piece of unvoiced grief, price visible in the growing rainbow of stones. Agency is cumulative, not causal, but escalation meets lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance through a bell—escalates via precise drip cadence; the 4.1-second interval becomes an on-page clock that narrows options to sustained attention. Cost is visible: hours motionless, tears, and the open-ended promise of endless repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“rescue memory from erasure”—is signaled early and tightens when directive vs. humanity conflict materializes in the bottle beat. Agency narrows to single choice: remove-and-destroy vs. remove-and-elevate; selecting latter forecloses bureaucratic compliance and risks job penalty. Cost is legible in on-page risk awareness (“reservoir authority’s directive echoed coldly”). No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens once: flame violence vs starling grace forecloses the brutal path. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence rescues. Cost is felt (possible irreversible fracture), but the price is more conceptual than tangible resource loss, capping entry to 8+ band. Still, the single deepening is meaningful and lens-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust via accurate forecast—signaled early; Serpent fracture tightens options. One meaningful deepening: buckle memory escalates to vine-lens tactic, foreclosing sloppy log option with visible cost (tear). Agency drives every turn under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent. Could reach 8.8 if price (e.g., frostbite twinge) had altered final typing rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in line 5 and tightens through the complementary-opposite method: each intensification of void acceptance raises the potential emotional yield until the gold ignition cashes it in. One meaningful deepening occurs when she stops fighting numbness and revalues it as canvas; this narrows options from “win custody” to “ midwife shared life.” Cost is legible: she permanently forfeits sole identity and legal claim. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversals, and remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—tightens via one decisive intensification: the tunnel’s echo converts mechanical roar into Clara’s ghost-laugh, forcing Elias to throttle down and accept partial restoration. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each gust macerates silence grain by grain until the pattern breaks. Cost is audible—the parents’ upstairs sob—proving the stake reached them. No reversals needed; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—befriend uncertainty or surrender to homesickness—signaled in paragraph 3. Tightening occurs when sunlight strikes pendant: option to return becomes live, narrows to single refusal. Cost is visceral: “ache…woven with threads of acceptance.” Under Accumulative lens, density of interiorized images escalates until refusal crystallizes stance. No reversal needed; one meaningful intensification satisfies 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt stifling destiny”—tightens when creative destruction reframes failure as fertile void, foreclosing repair-quest and forcing vivification. One meaningful escalation: surrender to listening replaces additive fixes with transformative melt. Cost legible in frost-burn knees and irrevocable abandonment of the bishop’s authority symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—hear the first breath inside the last sigh—is signaled early and tightened by each discarded filter. One meaningful deepening: when “silence” flips from emptiness to genesis, options narrow to irreversible stillness. Cost is legible—she pays with her former identity as seeker. No coincidence; lunar pull and tower resonance are environmental antagonists she must out-listen.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore everyone to normal reality—is signaled early and escalates through sensory dissolution and radio echoes. One meaningful tightening: the empty hourglass appears, forcing Leo to intuit the flip gesture that fuses timelines. Cost is cosmic, not personal, so pressure feels abstract in the final third; still, agency remains with Leo throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—control vs reverence for connection—signaled early. Escalation via density spike: illusions rupture into real memories, forcing renunciation of her controlling method. Agency present (she tries to reinforce, then gathers threads in new spirit). Cost visible (thread autonomy, tear, scattered loom). No coincidence resolution. Sufficient tightening for 600-word form; could edge higher if a prior failed attempt had foreshadowed the eruption rule.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“can we map stars from here?”—is signaled early. Single tightening occurs when scanning the link aligns the Dubhe-Merak angle; before/after options reconfigure, but no concrete obstacle or price is risked; doubt dissolves without residual cost. Escalation is conceptual, not tactical, sufficient at length but short of impact required for ≥8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protect Arthur’s last whisper—tightens once when the pulse resolves into the precise key/rose message; Lily’s visible straightening shows the cost has landed. No secondary reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“deliver witness before tide erases all”—is signaled early; each downward meter narrows escape margin, tightening pressure. Protagonist agency drives every beat: he turns the valve, stays to read, chooses to leave codex. Cost is legible: loss of relic + near-drowning. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal needed. Could edge 8.8 if a mid-scene complication (tool freeze, jammed door) had forced extra tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reconstitute erased identity before system repeats error. Escalation is textural—each ink stroke thickens pattern density, narrowing possibility from chaos to blueprint. No external antagonist; pressure is systemic negligence made flesh in flickering server glow. Cost is conceptual but felt: the ghost dissolves into “safeguarded” protocol, foreclosing her anonymity. One meaningful tightening suffices under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—the death of the Old Tongue—is signaled in line 3 and tightened by each aerial mimic until the spiral convergence forces the culminating utterance. Escalation is textural: each new bird glyph → new phoneme → echo layer compresses possibility until only the final word remains. Cost is legible—the diamond’s warmth and the towers’ marrow-vibration show energy extracted from her body/voice—but the price could be sharper (no exhaustion, tremor, or blood in the copper veins). Still, agency is continuous and luckless.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Aris’s need to decide whether to expose the cryptid—emerges late yet crystallizes with visible price: her forfeiture of academic redemption. Tightening comes via the arrowhead’s glow and Lyra’s address, forcing an irrevocable stance. Escalation is more imagistic than obstacle-based; a sharper mid-scene obstacle could have raised cost earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is signaled early and tightened when the heartbeat bowing risks exposure; the soft signal is a visible trade-off between safety and efficacy. One meaningful escalation: statue cracks spread, narrowing options to uproot the monolith now or lose the moment. Cost is legible—blood on thorns, violin offered not as weapon but as vulnerable gratitude—yet the statues’ instantaneous collapse slightly blunts the final price. Still, agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving clandestine connection under drone surveillance—is signaled early and tightened once when the patrol drone forces bottle use, foreclosing stealth. Escalation is causal, not cumulative, yet the single turn suffices for 600-word scope. Cost is visible (bottle charge spent, drone now airborne and discoverable), but the price feels technical rather than visceral because Kael’s body is never in jeopardy. Sufficient for high-band, short of 9+ until stakes pierce the skin.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove stories survive after the book closes—tightens once: the scarf-fold must verify the grandmother’s claim or falsify it. Escalation is textural: each tactile recall deepens density until the fold physically maps infinity. No antagonist needed; the asymptotic curve is the pressure. Cost is the acceptance of unlocatable location, a felt conceptual loss.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover the courtyard dream—tightens when the photograph proves to be abstract, forcing acceptance of essence over image; this narrows her future vocation from seeker to keeper. Pressure is accumulative: each dawn adds density until the pattern breaks. Cost is legible—her ritualized nights are now finite, the vigil fulfilled. Could be sharper had the refusal of further searching been dramatized in a single gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the stolen memory—tightens through the alignment detection beat; the luminous circle formation is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses denial. Agency is interior (attention, interpretation) yet causally decisive. Cost is felt in the tear-tracked grime and the mushroom’s release. Slight reserve: external pressure remains static; escalation is purely cognitive, keeping the band just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile—signals page 1 and tightens through each beat: annotation attempt, failed first reading, second seeing of spiral, final inscription. One meaningful deepening: chaos → spiral → “Return” narrows options from despair to navigable path. Price is conceptual but legible—Elara’s exile remains, yet its geometry is now map-able, foreclosing pure fatalism.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder against creeping gray—is signaled early and intensifies through each gathered color strand; the final infusion constitutes a meaningful tightening that forecloses retreat. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. A tangible, on-page sacrifice (fatigue, blood, memory) would have lifted the cost into the 8.5+ zone.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—quieting the spirits—tightens with each unraveled knot; the method itself is the pressure engine. One meaningful deepening: the daughter’s ribbon memory turns abstract grief into filial tether, narrowing Elara’s emotional options to personal identification. Cost is cumulative silence that finally swells into wave-of-peace; the price is her own unrest absorbed rather than expelled. No reversal, but accumulative lens legitimates the single intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protect the silence of sacred space—tightens when the shadow alignment proves the vault is an active instrument, raising the risk of exposure. Escalation is textural: each overlay of footage increases the density of rain/erosion imagery until the vault’s living status becomes undeniable. The visible price is her renunciation of louder fame; she forecloses that path by choosing “publish quietly,” a stance crystallisation under situational pressure. No coincidence resolves the tension; the 1989 shadow’s shorter fall is already documented in her notes, so agency remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will he ever let Elara go?—is signaled by word 79 and tightens once: the restored transmission + snow-globe demonstration foreclose the option to keep grieving actively. Escalation is textural: each rescued inch of oxide-caked tape increases emotional density until the serene captain’s voice re-prices surrender. Cost is visible—he secures the globe as “quiet promise,” stone settles with soft finality—meeting the 8.8+ threshold for felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are declared—articulate unspoken needs—but never sharpen into a specific risk or forfeiture; no symbol risks mis-carving, discovery, or personal loss. Pressure is atmospheric (storm window) rather than tactical; the sequence accumulates images without narrowing options. Cost is deferred to the conceptual realm, satisfying the lens yet limiting visceral escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—personal need to see "joy beneath anguish"—is signalled early and tested once: the diary decode tightens his emotional knowledge and forces a shift in vocational identity from anonymous courier to keeper of another’s grief. Agency is attention/renunciation: he completes the delivery but can no longer remain detached—on-page cost is the loaded silence he carries out. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational under consistent lens. Could wish for one additional mid-scene obstacle to push band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove absence holds form—signaled in paragraph 4 and tested with each cloud entry. Escalation is textural: layer upon layer of emotion-clouds compress until the fallstreak hole ruptures pattern, forcing conceptual payoff. No external antagonist needed; pressure is existential and cumulative. Visible price: journal’s final page consumed, telescope set aside—tools spent, task complete.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve her sky-murals—is signaled in paragraph 5; the tightening beat is the clang of machinery that forecloses the option to stay. Escalation is causal: each sensory beat increases the likelihood of loss until the coin offers an alternate path, narrowing her options to “abandon or lose everything.” The price is legible: she forfeits the physical murals and accepts the fractal sky as portable replacement. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the coin’s wisdom is discovered, not gifted by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the ship’s stranded light—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each cross-referenced pattern tightens possibility until only the 7-3-1 sequence remains. The decisive micro-turn is the finger-press that forecloses further search; cost is the solitude she must now carry as keeper. Coincidence (starlings happen to land in code) is introduced early and therefore allowed to complicate, not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm before his hands stiffen”—is signaled in para 3 and tightened when the fractured gear demands a listening stance. One meaningful deepening: light patterns diagnose wear, shifting her from replacement to re-harmonizing. Cost is conceptual but legible on-page: she abandons brute mastery for perpetual humility. No second reversal, but the single intensification suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save the orchard—signals early; blight tightens once, no reversals. Agency is collective: reexamine bell → salvage mirrors → align light; the tightening is the midnight deadline, not a character trade-off. Cost is aesthetic (wonder, relief) rather than tangible loss; no tool breaks, no relationship frays. Sufficient for 800 words, but the absence of a painful trade-off keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—“whisper the lullaby across a thousand lifetimes”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: the clock hands meet, options collapse into hush, and the price is her last breath of sound. No reversals are needed; the single deepening (pane activation) forecloses all escape while making the cosmic stakes viscerally felt. Agency is renunciation rather than combat, fully compatible with situational pressure. Cost is legible in her sinking to the floor and the world’s gentle fold, satisfying the 8-band requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“guide travelers before frost”—is signaled early and tightens with visible countdown (twilight, first crystals). One meaningful deepening: finding the nut turns impossible rescue into executable plan. Cost is legible: she trades her own escape for strangers’ safety, tomorrow’s ritual now harder. Escalation driven solely by her agency; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—is signaled in paragraph 4. Pressure tightens once: the foam reunion reframes divergence as necessary, foreclosing his prior rigid stance. Cost is conceptual but legible (“last tight knot of grief loosened”). No external antagonist needed; internal friction suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—find the living origin point—tightens when absence is quantified and the slate must be violated; parole’s ignition embodies the price. Single escalation beat suffices; causality intact, options narrowed: blankness is lost forever. Cost is dramatized, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will he absorb or refuse the king’s remorse—signaled by tidal pool regret. Mid-scene tightening: ice groans, weight settles, option to retreat vanishes. Cost legible in bone-brittle ache. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Coincidence absent; agency drives turn.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—valley silence versus communal voice—tightens when the Cherokee elevator’s hesitation threatens permanent fracture; Elara’s linguistic gamble forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: she finishes weary, pockets the once-cold now-warm weight as persistent reminder of fragility. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she let the chaos rewrite her?—tightens when the first foreign memory floods in, narrowing her options from observer to vessel. Each successive memory increases psychic cost; the spiral glass pattern physically embodies the escalating entanglement. No coincidence; all pressure is mediated through her deliberate meditation choice. Cost is legible: she rises “joints protesting” and accepts open-ended servitude.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover erased ancestry—tightens into three concrete vault codes revealed only if she risks the inversion. The sixty-minute clock visibly narrows options; failure cost is foreshadowed by her prior “minutes-late” scar. Price is felt: tears, soft landing, and the new burden to replant seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each strum deepens the chord of shared understanding, narrowing the option to stop without silencing the new resonance. The tightening is singular but meaningful; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the tree’s final surrender and Elara’s tears, meeting 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve chess as pure intellect—survives intact; pressure tightens when geomagnetic pulses translate into recollections of royal coercion. Single meaningful escalation: eastward spike → stillness void → renunciation reframed as fidelity. Cost is opportunity loss (court, library) legible in final image. No causal reversal required under accumulative design; one decisive intensification suffices. Could edge higher if the prince’s political threat carried a sharper contemporary consequence on page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“recover the silence trapped within”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens through sensory accretion: each dial-turn increases the emotional voltage until the clasp yields. The irreversible cost is legible: Elara’s tears, ledger entry, and the enforced quiet of tomorrow’s non-speaking visit foreclose easier verbal absolution. No causal antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the tightening is textural, single-use, and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she endure the corpse flower’s future reek to claim its healing power?—is signaled in seed beat and escalates through daily sensory micro-tests. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent under accumulative lens. One visible cost: she accepts the stench as “honest story,” narrowing her future options. Could edge higher if an external consequence (village scorn, lost clientele) had been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the western groves—threads every beat; each new wonder (real-time fruiting, echo-sensations) intensifies the question of whether Kael will take or tend. The meaningful tightening occurs when he dips the withered twig: the instant renewal proves the source’s power and simultaneously forces the ethical fork—harvest vs. reverence—so options narrow with visible price. Agency remains one-directional; once the arrow vibrates he never seriously considers exploitation, so pressure plateaus rather than compounds. Still, the single fork is credible and on-page, satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent recurrence via pinpointing convergence—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the second patch personalizes the cost. Agency is investigative: each data point forecloses false causes until only oscillation remains. Visible price: Kael pockets Croft’s patch, accepting custodianship of another man’s fatal misjudgment. Escalation is knowledge-driven under causal lens; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—certify wonder—tightened through each chromatic strike that risks shattering the hush forever. Agency is pure: every ringing act deepens stakes; no coincidence. Escalation legible as layered resonance; cost visible in aurora-echoing fatigue. Would enter 8.8 band with a moment where failure felt imminent and costly (crack in bell, fracture in ice).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—harvesting failure’s insight—signaled in para 1. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: each driftwood placement tightens ritual stakes until the note tears open memory. Protagonist agency drives the escalation; no coincidence. Cost is felt: leaving the markers forecloses any later attempt to erase his fault. Could edge higher if the on-page price were sharper (e.g., physical toll or external witness), but the internal reckoning suffices for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can she survive the empathy mathematics—signaled in para 1. Pressure escalates as each borrowed emotion narrows agency to fatal dissociation; the halo amplifies until collapse feels inevitable. One decisive tightening: realizing ambiguity itself is the constant reconfigures her options from pursuit to acceptance. Cost is visible: permanent internal chorus replaces solitary clarity—she pays in unending cognitive noise.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can wonder survive Elara’s absence?”—tightens when memory shifts from private ache to shared legend; options narrow from carrying crates to carrying possibility. Pressure escalates via texture: silence → scent → warmth → hum → crack → glow. The cost is the irreversible exposure of the seed and his own transformed identity; no reversal, only deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove emotional absorption—signaled early; the spiral discovery is the single meaningful tightening that reweights options. Agency is Kael’s interpretive act; cost is the collapse of his theory and public credibility. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no causal reversals required. Cost is legible in final image (droplets as prisms of transformed view).

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—deliver a love-message across fifty lost years—never wavers and is tightened by the accelerating drain of color from the orchard. One visible cost-chain is unmistakable: each memory-thread subtracts pigment from present reality until she herself dematerializes; this is agency-through-renunciation under the accumulative lens. No false reversal or coincidence intrudes; pressure mounts by accretion rather than twist. Score stays sub-8.5 because the middle beats plateau: the orchard greys, but no secondary obstacle complicates her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the grove—signaled early; escalation is one smooth rising curve as silk pulse travels upward. Agency is ritual, not tactical; Kael’s only decision is to begin the rite, so pressure feels external rather than option-narrowing. Cost is present but abstract (lost memory) and not re-felt at climax. Still, the tightening beat of ignition visibly changes the world, satisfying basic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus comfortable blame—tightens when the weave threatens to eject her; agency is her decision to redirect inward intent, narrowing options from pursuit to acceptance. Cost visible: the shard cools, the cyclical tide stabilizes, she forfeits the moral simplicity of sabotage. Escalation tracks because/therefore: each jump intensifies sensory overload until internal recalibration becomes the only remaining move. No coincidence; even the volatile turn is seeded by “unseen cosmic rhythms” established early.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the wordless chain alive—tightens once: from passive discovery of the dark lamp to active creation of the Phoenix Stack. The stacking act is an irreversible tactical choice that narrows Elias’s future to perpetual guardian; price is the physical ache and the emotional burden he now bottles. Escalation is accumulative: each placed stone increases density of obligation until the cobalt shard ignites the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—shape dawn from chaos—signaled early; pressure escalates the moment laugh births storm. One meaningful tightening: storm forces Kael to convert rage into glyphs under time-pressure of rising wind. Cost is legible: sweat-salt, warming shard, lifelong silence required. Agency stays internal (minute tilts of wick) yet alters external sea-state—earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why stories cling—tightens when the wing’s flash reframes the question into “how to host stories.” Single deepening suffices for lyric length; cost is the lifelong discipline of restraint now bound to her dyes. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent attention vs. impatience.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—access arboreal memory—remains legible throughout; pressure escalates via seasonal accumulation of dream-fragments rather than external opposition. The single decisive tightening occurs when moonlight hits: failure is no longer possible, but the price is integration of strangers’ dreams into one man’s grief, a trade-off that reshapes Elara’s vocation. No visible resource loss (time, social credit) is dramatized, keeping the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindling realm before endless night—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when each sung syllable visibly forecloses isolation by knitting saffron threads across the sky. Protagonist agency is the singing endurance that pays the vigil cost; no coincidence resolves. Pressure escalates through lyrical accumulation under Accumulative lens; visible price is the century-long vigil relinquished. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; closure cost legible.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal reweaving emerges from the concrete image sequence—bread shared, fences mended, stories traded—rather than assertion. Final image of dewdrop holding miniature sunrise reweights prior fragments into covenant restored. No moralizing line; resonance left charged and ambiguous. Subtext operates in silence between song notes and the bell answering from valleys.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus self-forgiveness—tightens when the astral eavesdropping reveals the society’s compassion, foreclosing her need to grovel. Midnight clock supplies real-time pressure. Cost is legible: she accepts permanent upstairs exile in exchange for restored purpose. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can memory be converted into living hope without erasing loss?—is signaled in first third and tightened when Madame Lin presents the duplicate loaf, forcing Elara to decide whether to keep or share the relic. Pressure is textural: each seed placed reweights the crust’s meaning; no external antagonist needed. One credible loss: she gives away the last physical trace of the bakery, foreclosing hoarding as option. Cost is visible but not yet painful enough for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rescue meaning before final fade—is signaled immediately; agency is the measured sampling that progressively strips the vow to numbers, tightening the cost from vivid garden to zero amplitude. One visible price: the slide goes permanently blank, foreclosing any future re-projection. The escalation is textural rather than causal, but the deepening sensory loss reweights the stake effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—the truce’s survival versus recording its rupture—tightens with each false start until Silas’s shouted accusation collapses options. Escalation is protagonist-driven: every intervention raises Silas’s desperation and communal scrutiny, visible in sharper breaths and traded nods. The price is legible—Elara forfeits neutral observer status when she brandishes the ledger, exposing herself to future retaliation. One meaningful reversal, no coincidence, lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“is personalized weather real?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once when copper-error shifts to honey-alignment, foreclosing retreat. Agency is interior (accept perception) yet produces visible external change (personal rain), satisfying the Accumulative escalation model. No coincidence resolves the core question; the aurora’s reply is cosmetic affirmation, not causal fix. Price is legible: lifelong skepticism dissolved and replaced by empathic burden she must now literally carry.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rectify creative exile—tightens when the empty chest fails, then narrows further to the single calcite canvas. Agency: she decides to sketch, triggering the crystalline response that exposes the numbers. Cost is felt: the act reopens grief yet simultaneously ends her exile. Escalation is accumulative density rather than causal reversal, fully valid under inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—tightens when the basin reveals they live only in candid breath; this forecloses the archival path with felt cost. Pressure escalates accumulatively: merchant lie → wilt → child’s confession (micro-turn) → elder’s rain grief → zinc warms → chamber empties. No coincidence resolves; final renunciation is active. Could use one earlier visible tactical loss to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—restore collective memory of blue—tightens once when the solstice angle triggers the fragment’s glisten, narrowing possibility to this instant. Escalation is accumulative: each bell strike and light scatter deepens the same stake until the fragment exhausts its stored color, paying the visible cost. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore coherent memory—tightens when static dissolves Lena’s laugh into screech; miniaturize action forecloses archiving option. One meaningful turn: controlled burn becomes only viable path once beam ignites. Cost is legible: permanent loss of physical fear-objects buys interior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—unlock the mailbox before noon—is signaled early and tightens once the city notice appears. Escalation is single-cycle rather than iterative; the external deadline supplies pressure, but Elara’s agency is largely receptive (listening, assembling), so the cost feels communal rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turn isolation into bridge—tightens once: the dice force “LISTEN” which collapses ambient noise into the single chime that must be acted on. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded line adds filamental pressure until the third chime narrows options to one precise valve turn. Price is felt: the groan of seals releases her only companion (the buoy) leaving her alone with salt-cold wheel marks on palms.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—silence the coded prophecy—is signaled early and tightened when the fracture stings her with “moon bleeds / earth forgets.” Escalation is textural: each mapped silence thickens the pattern until the exhalation ruptures it. The cost is real (wing lost, guardianship assumed) yet stays conceptual; a sharper bodily or social price would push this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to listen compassionately—tightens when archival facts are shown to be hollow against living memory. One meaningful deepening: cornerstone date exposed as compassionate fiction reweights her method and forecloses pure excavation. No external antagonist needed; internal vs external conflict fuse neatly. Cost is felt in her renunciation of interrogation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens once: the humming beat forces her to release the memory into crystal, foreclosing endless mourning. Cost is visible (tears, cooled shell, buried fragment). No reversal needed; single meaningful deepening satisfies short-form.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberation from calibrated treason’s guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the ritual demands surrender of the last relics. One meaningful deepening: the pause of absolute silence compresses options to forgive or remain chained. Cost is the relinquishing of the thorn and key, symbols of both crime and penance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped echoes—tightens with each shell disclosure; the third whisper forces physical movement to the monolith, narrowing options. Cost is atmospheric rather than corporeal: the shell’s silence and her tear-streaked cheeks show price paid. Agency is continuous attention/interpretation; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover a loving final image for the bereaved—is signaled early and deepened when Elara realizes the cameo is joy, not trauma. One decisive escalation: shifting from private witness to external messenger, narrowing her safe isolation. Cost is felt (the frozen tear, dawn exhaustion), yet pressure is largely internal; external stakes for Eleanor remain off-stage, capping intensity just below the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are the philosopher’s need to verify that hidden effort matters; the helix of fireflies after his whistle tightens the stake by publicly validating his creed, foreclosing solitary spectatorship. Cost is legible: he must shoulder the repaired net—and its stories—back into human commerce.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—truth vs. survival of sanctuary—tightens once the letters reveal the benevolent hoax. Agency crystallizes when she reburies the archive; on-page cost is the surrender of her lifelong identity as debunker. Pressure plate is solitary, no external antagonist, sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is signaled early, yet pressure escalates only by accretion of listeners, not by any narrowing of Elara’s own options. She broadcasts; the world reacts off-stage. No reversal or trade-off is demanded of her; the ionosphere clearing is sheer gift. Cost is felt by distant villagers, not by the protagonist, so agency and escalation register as atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“old songs must not vanish”—is signaled early and tested by the storm-recovered music box. One meaningful tightening: the unwinding spring forces a now-or-never capture; failure would complete his earlier silence to Elara. Cost is felt in the sealed beeswax and etched apology. Stakes stay personal and lyrical; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect the Chime—is signaled early and tightened when the harmonic stabilizer shatters, forcing a single live option: vibrational matching. Escalation is iterative rather than reversed, but each strike-listen-refine cycle narrows error and raises psychic cost until silence lands. Price is visible in bodily fatigue and the key’s residual hum. Missing a secondary loss (tool, time, social credit) keeps it shy of 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—free her people from “tyranny of haste”—tightens through one decisive intensification: the sigil demands surrender, not force. Escalation is accumulative: each moon path logged adds density until the single alignment forecloses impatience itself. Protagonist agency drives the turn—she chooses softness against every instinct. Price is the irreversible surrender of her former urgency, felt in the dissolving coil inside her chest.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—exposing the society—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when evidence of struggle overrides the official accident narrative. The lantern’s empathic hit is the single meaningful tightening: it turns her goal from “check the shaft” to “seize proof,” narrowing options and raising personal exposure. Cost is visible: she absorbs traumatic memories that will persist. Under causal lens, escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias convert guilt into restorative action—tightens once: from “debt to repay” to “seed to nurture.” The fracture discovery is the single escalation that flips his possible futures; the melody of “Amazing Grace” audibly forecloses wallowing and commits him to prison ministry. Cost is legible on-page: he accepts undeserved mercy, a stance that will expose him to further sorrow inside the walls. No reversal inflation; one meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“ring unheard bell”—signaled in paragraph 3; pressure tightens when the unbroken circle vision forecloses further iteration and demands final transliteration. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn’s fragment builds density; the last vision collapses possibility into singularity. Cost legible: arrow-tip glow, marrow-chime, tear-tracks. No antagonist needed; tension borne by iterative risk and final irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth vs protect it—tightens when revelation forces Elara to choose complicity or exposure; her lie forecloses reversal. Escalation is single but meaningful: discovery of post-crash video annihilates the “accident” narrative and raises personal risk. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual silence, a guardianship that could end her career. No redundant reversals; coincidence only initiates, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—save the orchard from encroaching ice—is clear in paragraph 1. Escalation is lyric-accumulative: each mirror glimpse layers emotional density until the bud/ice/seed triad fuses into the healing surge. No narrowing of options; the task is always “restore,” so pressure is existential, not tactical. Cost is present but diffuse—the shard’s warmth, the shadow’s new color—felt yet not sharpened to a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she keep the appointment?—tightens once when the net yields Lars’s father journal; knowledge that “ice remembers” reframes her own ending sound. Escalation is accretive: each sensory fold (patience, net, fireside) narrows isolation until belonging becomes the live option. Cost is opportunity: she forecloses tonight’s exit; price is legible but soft. No reversal beyond the single deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can this mismatch endure?—is signaled early; single deepening occurs when Elara’s parallel reveals silence ≠ distance, narrowing options from leave/stay to stay/tend; cost legible in relinquished bus and Elara’s renewed solitude, but escalation is one-note lyric repetition rather than rising tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake—“preserve the echo before silence claims it”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens via the irreversible dimming of each vibration. Escalation is textural: resonance fades like cooling embers, forcing Kael to risk permanent loss if he falters. The single decisive turn is the shift from trying to “capture” to consecrating via indirect awareness; this narrows his option set and visibly costs stamina (“joints aching”). No coincidence resolves the tension; the clearing’s emergence is earned by synchronized bodily alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“transmute pain into shared masterpiece”—is signaled early and deepens through each restored photo. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is accretive consensus. The visible price is the archive’s relinquishment and the erosion of bitterness in real time. One meaningful tightening: Liam’s tear shifts community uptake from skeptic to participation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early and tightens through each marker placement; the audible creak is the undeniable payoff. Escalation is textural: each chalk symbol increases the density of loss until the single resonant note is reached. Cost is legible in the instant fade of the sound and the grandfather-memory she forfeits. Persistent constraint (precognitive forgetting) narrows options every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the 1.7-spectral-second Lunar Veil recording—signaled early; pressure tightens when Chronometer spins wildly, narrowing options to one: empathic release, not force. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to *listen* rather than tighten rewires the stakes from technical failure to philosophical surrender. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of mechanical certainty, embracing fragility; persistent constraint (moon’s constancy) shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can goodbye be bearable?—tightens once: from frozen grief to shared remembrance via song. Agency is Elara’s choice to weave shard into lyric; cost is Lena’s surrender of solitary mourning. Escalation is single-wave, sufficient for 700-word lyric design; luck (lavender breeze) complicates but doesn’t resolve, since Arthur’s memory cue is earned. Could reach 8.8 if scent were actively retrieved by Lena rather than gifted by breeze.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and tightened when corrupted gears threaten to abort the awakening. One meaningful reversal: the mechanism shudders, foreclosing the easy victory; her chalk redraw becomes the last viable option. Cost is legible: the sanctuary opens, then seals again, leaving her with knowledge but no tangible reward beyond the warm key—an opportunity cost felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Elara confirm or refute changeling myth—tightens once at the tooth reveal, foreclosing revenge and forcing public pedagogical risk. Escalation is accumulative: fear density → scientific evidence → communal confrontation, each increment raising social cost. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no off-stage rescue. Visible price: she forfeits private grief for public tutorial, stakes crystallized in “cartographer of grace” exit line.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—craft safe light for fevered child—signaled early, but pressure is ambient, not tightening. No active opposition or trade-off; the only obstacle is the glass’s own opacity, which yields steadily. Escalation is a gentle density increase under Accumulative lens; no option is foreclosed. Satisfies single-deepening rule for lyric short-form but misses visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she relinquish the viral shame anchored in the pendant?—ratchets through each sensorial beat until the burial forecloses retrieval. Cost is visible (loss of Lena’s gift) and conceptual (public narrative can no longer be edited), meeting the 8+ trade-off bar.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—collect ephemeral hopes before the novel closes—is signaled early and tightened by each cameo, but pressure is cumulative, not causal; no option is foreclosed or price visibly paid. The “current of nihilism” remains off-page abstraction, so the cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt, keeping escalation in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred songs—is signaled early; pressure is the precision timing alignment, not antagonistic opposition. Escalation is textural: denser gold stories, widening botanical revival, humming roots; yet no option narrows or price is exacted from her—success feels inevitable once song starts. Agency is obedience to researched steps rather than a risky improvisation inside uncertainty. Coincidence assists, never complicates; thus tension plateaus beneath high-band demand for a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bind cosmic light to living pulse—signaled early; pressure escalates as mis-alignment risks “terrifying void” of flash-paper ash. The final sealing narrows options: map gained, vigil ended, cold’s bite recedes—cost legible but emotionally faint, keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—rescue the season’s silenced wonder by fixing the timer—tightens when each reflection reveals a deeper layer of breakage. Misalignment discovery is a genuine reversal: the problem was never broken gears but a ghost loop of correct function, forcing Kael to re-tool rather than replace. Cost is visible time-tax: dusk arrives, the cavern violet-gold, and Kael’s chest tightens as he seals the echoes—he pays with finite daylight and emotional room. No off-stage rescue; every escalation stems from his attentional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stake—convert dispersed anxiety into solid weight—tightens once via the shuttle-angle micro-choice that precipitates crystallization; cost is the merchant’s dread now ossified and Elara’s perpetuation of her lonely archive, legible though not foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“contain grief without surrender”—is signaled early; escalation is accretive: each shaving removes avoidance and narrows tomorrow’s options. No causal reversal, but the deepening pattern forecloses the option to leave the blank uncarved, with felt cost in the whistle-shattered pause and the deliberate bitterness in her tea.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeem or relinquish eroded ambition—is signaled by line 97 and tightens when the ghost’s uneroded potential confronts Elara’s regret. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes erosion is “part of the art” narrows options from restoration to integration. Cost is visible in the spent wheel and tear-tracked apology. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can abandoned infrastructure birth new purpose?—is signaled early and tightened once: the water’s arrival reframes the terminal from tomb to observatory. Cost is the physical labor and the irreversible placement of the relic as dam; no coincidence resolves the blockage. Agency is continuous; no external savior appears.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem abandoned dream—signaled paragraph 1. Pressure escalates via density: hush thickens, droplets accumulate, regret sharpens. Single tightening: fork-on-crystal act forces recognition that clocks were always her symphony; option to keep dreaming literally dropped from hand. Cost visible in tear and permanent offering; no external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—exposing the lie—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens once when hidden numerals re-target the quest. Escalation is knowledge-based under causal lens; options narrow from “chase myth” to “document fraud.” Felt cost is present but diffuse; a sharper tangible loss (radio silence = career bridge burned?) would push 9.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve method, not object—signaled in paragraph 4 and tested when she must choose to value the knot knowledge over mere possession. One meaningful tightening: diamond knot → Turk’s-head signals sacred trust, forcing her tacit vow to guard method. Cost is conceptual but legible: she leaves with lighter philosophical cargo yet heavier responsibility. Could use one tangible forfeiture (time, tool, social credit) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode Isolde’s absence—tightens once when Kael reveals the queen’s redirected love; Elara’s agency is reception, not action, so the cost is observational rather than tactical, keeping pressure just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—tightens when the spectral bird proves ephemeral, forcing the choice to accept memory over resurrection. One meaningful deepening: the Lark’s light restores tapestries and jasmine for three heartbeats, then dissolves, foreclosing physical restoration and pivoting purpose to legacy. Cost is visible on-page: the empty shell and warm feather embody the trade-off. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—transform inherited fire into life—signaled in paragraph 1. Single meaningful deepening: ceremonial graft forecloses passive remembrance; kelp must root or rot, staking reputation. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost visible on-page: coin surrendered, shame exposed, future failure possible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—liberate memories before dawn bleeds the box—tightens through pattern-verification beats; each successful test warms the box, raising odds of irreversible failure if she quits. Escalation is Accumulative: density of verified clues intensifies emotional ante rather than external peril. Visible price paid at each fountain (coin surrendered, rosemary bruised, soil under nails) progressively narrows retreat; final goose-cry crystallizes cost into irreversible keeper-role. No coincidence resolves—wild geese echo Lyra already etched on lid.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens through incremental ping-tests; one mis-alignment could ignite catastrophe, a visceral price. Escalation is textural: each successful ping layers ancestral confidence yet highlights fragility, culminating in the sustainable dawn. Agency is present (gear adjustments, ping emission), but the absence of an opposing force keeps pressure poetic rather than dramatically fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible early: find a shape for 37-fold communal grief before personal paralysis hardens. Escalation is Accumulative—each recalled poem and ribbon-tie adds density until the swarm of monarchs forces the pattern break; options narrow to living migration or static monolith. Cost is visible: she forfeits the safety of a single authoritative stone, embracing endless footfalls and weathering. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Textural lens. One meaningful tightening—realizing grief must migrate—reweights all prior ribbon/poem images.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—temporal and moral order—remains coherent; removing grit is a single, meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of leaving the past un-mended. Cost is present but gentle: her inscription adds one more obligation to an already burdened lineage, not a new sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode intention—tightens once when the spiral pattern emerges, foreclosing the misbelief of surrender. No visible price exacted from Elara herself; cost is observational, not personal, keeping it below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation or doom the kingdom to eternal stasis—tightens once when the model converges and doubt is burned off; the price is the unwritten promise now resting on a single finger-width of suspended ink, a visible forfeiture of retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—keep listening/transcribing without being discovered—tightens once when interference crackles and the cloak slips. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting the lyric lens; the single intensification is sufficient. Price is implied (exposure risk, the silence she must now carry alone) but not made physically concrete; hence stops just short of the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crystallize the grandmother’s hidden grief—signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Elara decides to draw “the sorrow it concealed,” not the mask. One meaningful deepening suffices: the rocking chair’s fading creak acts as a live metronome that narrows temporal options. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent. Cost is visible in the ash scatter that ends the ritual—she forfeits the mask’s last physical fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preservation of empirical truth vs. annihilation by surface dogma—tightens when the tablet’s child-handwriting proves knowledge was once ordinary. One meaningful deepening: the same artifact that could vindicate him threatens his archive, forcing the hiding act. Escalation is causal: because Valerius would confiscate, Kael’s options narrow to silence. The price (perpetual secrecy) is dramatized on-page as he wraps the tablet, forfeiting the recognition he has risked plague-ash lungs to earn.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—braid voices amid hatred—tightens through subtractive practice; each silent rehearsal forecloses retaliation as live option. Visible cost: Liam’s falter, Anya’s steadying hum, tear on Elara’s cheek—hatred unlearned note by note. One deepening suffices; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Pressure coherent, escalation subtle but undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“create something beautiful from ruins”—is signaled early and tested by each prune that discards edible memory. Pressure deepens via accumulative pattern: every cut releases a sharper taste of loss, raising the implicit cost of failure. The final shoot does not resolve tension by luck; it is earned through cumulative nourishment of pruned sorrow. No live antagonist, yet the choke of dead vines supplies coherent external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder inside routine—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when disclosure risks institutional flattening. Agency pivot: Kael elects poetic transfer via riddle, trading control for wonder’s survival; the cost is surrendering sole ownership of truth. Escalation comes via deepening, not external twists: each sentence of the riddle refracts the same sunset into larger implications until shutdown is re-valued as homage. Visible price: Dr. Aris carries away the lacquer box—Kael’s inherited authority physically leaves the tower, leaving him with only vigil and ember.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—remains intellectual; no external obstacle or internal risk escalates after she plants the shard. Pressure plateaus: the “profound hush” is sensory, not tactical, so options don’t narrow and no price is exacted from her, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can the city accept nuance instead of certainty?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when each revelation forecloses denial. Agency sits with Kael: dissolve ampoule, thread memory, accept own cracking. Cost is legible: his granite body becomes permeable. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the exact texture of missed opportunity—tightens once: the rupture offers the literal texture, she chooses verification over escape, paying the price of perpetual confinement. Pressure escalates Accumulative/Texturally: each etched symbol layers density until the air itself tears, a single decisive intensification. No external reversals are needed; the conflict is stance-vs-self. Cost is visible (she stays, climb continues forever) so 8.4; higher would require a second tactical twist within word count.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness is remembered—is signaled early and tested when the canvas is left unattended; the nurse’s note tightens the stake by confirming and extending the premise. Escalation is single but meaningful: stranger does not merely receive, she contributes a new “word,” raising the ante from memory to co-authorship. No coincidence resolves; the risk of indifference is real until the note appears. Cost is emotional, not physical, yet legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revive or lose the bread custom—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the silver-leaf discovery reframes “broken” as “adaptable.” The meaningful turn occurs at the carving reveal: knowledge narrows options from mournful停滞 to risky improvisation. Cost is visceral—bitter herb, maple stand-in, elders’ tear-tracked consent—felt on the tongue in the final bite. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates a second time, keeping this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—prove time is a puzzle, not prison—tightens when the exposed stone and nadir tide foreclose hesitation; protagonist’s clutch-disengagement is the irreversible trade-off that pays the visible cost of rewriting the beacon’s law.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—force fear to confess its weakness—escalates through three advisor gambits, each narrowing his margin (dictionary quote → teddy-bear lie → self-offering). The entity’s shrieked resistance and final tremor make cost audible. Advisor’s persistent agency drives every turn; coincidence absent. Price—loss of cursed invisibility—lands on-page, though the pain of becoming visible is named rather than felt, keeping the score just below the 8.5 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single tightening arc: interpret spiral → sketch → dub lattice → invite storm. Agency never relinquishes to coincidence; the price is the prophet’s spent stamina and the orchard’s perpetual dependence on his song. Stakes stay legible—if the lattice fails, trees and prophet sink together.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—will the city remain sealed?—tightens precisely once: the moment the sun hits the crack at the calculated angle, forcing the play-or-retreat decision. Agency is absolute: only Elara’s pattern-derived frequency can complete the gate’s sentence; engineers’ brute force is shown futile. Cost is visible—the crack’s bloom consumes the last of the rust’s latent energy, irreversibly altering the gate and exposing Carapacea to the wastes. Under causal lens, the tightening because/therefore linkage culminates in a single, irreversible threshold cross.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth—tightens once the letter is read aloud: the comforting myth is foreclosed, stakes shift from secrecy to communal clarity; escalation is textural (ivy sigh, sunlight break) rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens; price is the loss of protective narrative, visible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rescue dreams from obliteration—tightens once: drawbridge clang narrows the window, forcing the last note and exit. The escalation is Accumulative: each inserted note increases stakes for the next; no external antagonist needed. Cost is the unseen archive, felt but not visibly priced on-page, keeping it just below the 8.2 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore erased indigenous voice—tightens the instant the watermark contradicts the Charter’s origin myth. One meaningful escalation: discovery of the spiral-shell indentation forces her to abandon the planned authentication and instead imprint the suppressed sigil, foreclosing any future denial she might claim. Cost is legible: she permanently marks the archive with evidence of its own lie, an act that could end her career. Under causal lens, agency drives every ratchet; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—render grief bearable—signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each fold; the silver gem’s flare is the single decisive intensification that forces the trade-off (record pain ≠ erase it). Under Accumulative lens, density of cranes and polished gems reweights the emotional cost until the last bird crystallizes options. No coincidence resolves; ascent of island continues, but her internal descent narrows choices to: fold again or fracture. Price is visceral—every sheet of dream-luminescent paper consumed is one irretrievable shard of night.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“where does unused potential pool?”—signals in line 4 and tightens exactly once when the stillness emerges, foreclosing her prior metaphysical ignorance. Cost is legible: she must carry the “intangibly tangible” weight forever; this is the price of the hunt. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening of image-density (geode→Earth→silent ocean) is sufficient escalation; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the orrery’s hum makes the abstract visceral. One meaningful escalation: the drone’s chime shifts the quest from search to recovery, narrowing options to a single stone. Cost is felt in body (tremor) and social risk (sharing the moment with Elara). No secondary reversal is needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—return the withheld truth—remains coherent; pressure intensifies when the carving resurrects the pocket-watch forgery, crystallizing the cost of continued silence. One meaningful deepening suffices for the length. Because Elias’s final action is deferred to dawn, the price is promised rather than immediately paid, capping entry to the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will tonight’s protocol fail as Veridian did?—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Elias’s moon-phase rule faces the real-time risk of Kaela’s silent cooperation. One visible price: he forfeits political praise for slower celestial timing, a tactical loss shown, not told. Escalation is micro but sufficient: the mist lift exposes the delegation, forcing the nod that severs captives and, symbolically, his own chains. No second reversal, but the single deepening satisfies short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can he navigate without self-condemnation?—is signaled early. Escalation arrives the instant poles disappear: option set collapses from terrestrial to celestial, pressure crystallizes. Protagonist agency drives the turn: he actively lifts gaze, wipes glass, mounts compass. Cost is renunciation of penance-as-identity; felt price lands in the shanty-hum that replaces silence. One hair under 9 only because external antagonistic force is geography itself—less personal than human opposition—but still cleanly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—recover empathy—tightens when each decoded fragment forecloses retreat; lake confrontation forces final stance with felt price. One meaningful escalation sufficient under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens exactly once: when she realizes the ritual demands surrendering the very gift Kael loved. That surrender forecloses any return to her former life; the price is the orchard’s quiet exile of her animal companions. No reversals are needed in a lyric accumulative design; the deepening occurs when spice-scent thickens into visible mist and her chest begins its “insistent unspooling.” The cost is legible on-page: she becomes the orchard’s pulse, never again the woman who could kneel beside a fox.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve stolen time—tightens once: the realization that fractures are vessels, not voids. No external antagonist, but the pressure of thin air and maternal guilt coheres under situational lens. Price is legible (she gives up the need for certainty), yet escalation is a single deepening rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—open the lock or accept eternal solitude—is signaled early and tightens through each recalled shimmer. Joy-weight loss is the visible price that alters tactics (she must court delight inside grief). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: integration → massless → threshold. No live opponent, yet internal pressure keeps climbing until the final seam parts.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—comprehending transformation through relinquishment—tightens once: from clutching twenty-four jars to open-palmed sky. The tightening is textural (river of living light vs. dark) rather than causal, sufficient under Accumulative lens, but no secondary obstacle complicates or raises price beyond sentimental loss.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—unlogged speech—tightens when every degree of gnomon rotation risks exposure. Escalation is single-track but sufficient: the flare costs visibility and cannot be recalled, a felt price that alters later tactics. The blackout clock (true darkness window) supplies urgent coherence without external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore friction or remain in universal slide—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the curse shows failure. The spiral act is the single meaningful deepening that narrows options: draw aurora energy or accept endless drift. Cost is visible (dimming light, spent dust) and alters later tactics (she resets stones with reverence, not triumph). No coincidence resolves; the eels’ mirrored spiral merely acknowledges, not rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“understand the cartography of scars”—is signaled in paragraph four and deepens through each textual layer: timetable ghost, mentor letter, her own tear-rivers. Escalation is Accumulative: every image of erased or hidden text (censorship, brittle schedule, sealed envelope) thickens until the vigil flips from passive waiting to active witness. The timer’s chime is the single tightening beat that forces the stance crystallization; no reversal is needed because the pressure is pattern-density. Cost is felt on-page: the old composure mask shatters with the sob, foreclosing the safety of exile-without-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will she decipher before sun shifts?”—signals early; each aligned needle tightens the pattern, raising conceptual cost of failure. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative density. Wind complication is absorbed, not defeated, keeping agency internal. Final price: surrender of rhetorical armor for sunrise collaboration, legible as earned risk.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the poet keep the resistance alive through the molt?—is signaled in paragraph 4. Pressure tightens once: fear of abandonment rises, then is rebutted by Kael’s beam-of-light image, forcing acceptance. Cost is legible: loss of Silas’s granite voice, replaced by uncertain root-voice. No external antagonist needed; internal/external stakes braid through the communal rebuild.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—loosen grief’s chokehold—tightens when compasses override geography. One meaningful turn: the needle locks on her heart, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the irretrievable minute she gives up to gain the 3:18; visible but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—transmute guilt into visible color—tightens once: memory vision forces acceptance of cerulean regret. No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates via lace knot = “observe,” forcing undiluted witness of dock scene. The final image forecloses denial; cost is the enduring shade he must now carry. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; dock memory supplies the felt price.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning requires violence or can emerge from quiet accumulation—is signaled early and deepened through Aris’s daily returns. His agency drives escalation: he chooses observation over efficiency, presence over control. The cost is felt in his relinquished worldview (“grand theories missing this earthy poetry”) and embodied in his shift from researcher to student. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each dawn revealing finer shifts that narrow his intellectual options until surrender becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming truth rather than fleeing it—is signaled early and deepens when frost reveals the ledger’s coded routes. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to interpret, remember, and ultimately transmute. The cost is legible—her studio burned, body injured—and the final decision forecloses anonymity. Under an Accumulative lens, the tightening occurs not through plot turns but through intensifying resonance: each frost filament sparks memory, narrowing her path to creation. No coincidence resolves; insight arises from environment and prior trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into shared understanding—is signaled early and deepens when Liam arrives, forcing Elara to extend her private ritual into communal vulnerability. The tightening occurs when she chooses to invite him, risking retraumatization. Cost is unmistakable: both characters relinquish isolation, paid in raw anguish (magenta/charcoal) and released breath. Agency drives escalation—Elara’s strike of the fork beside Liam’s hand actively weaves calm, altering the emotional landscape through her will.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes intensify cleanly: from preserving silence to answering the deepest distress signal—being forgotten. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Elias recognizes the lens’s fractures as “distress signals,” forcing a trade-off between protocol (log as salvage) and compassion (revitalize). His agency drives escalation: each shard placement narrows his role from archivist to medium, with cost felt in the irreversible alteration of texts. The mechanical crab’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s choices alone transform anguish into testimony, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational trust amid scarcity—is signaled early and deepened through the midnight runs, which narrow options: anonymity is necessary for safety, yet connection requires proximity. The tightening occurs when Lena steadies Lin, transforming skepticism into bond—a micro-turn that justifies the bell’s ringing. Cost is legible: they risk exposure for emotional sustenance, and the bell’s new purpose forecloses public celebration. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled immediately and deepens through breath-controlled revelation. Each exhalation tightens focus, narrows perception, and escalates access to hidden truth, culminating in the luminous map and stone heart. The cost is conceptual but legible: Elara must release the memory’s sharp edges through compassionate witnessing, transforming regret into gratitude. Agency is fully hers—no coincidence resolves the quest; breath alone unlocks the reservoir. The escalation is subtle but consistent under the Accumulative lens, with each breath cycle intensifying stakes and narrowing the path to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped time/memory—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses surrender over force at the nexus. The escalation hinges on protagonist agency: her understanding of hyperbolic geometry drives the method, and the cost (twenty years of isolation, emotional quaking) is felt in her trembling. However, the “ghost of Aris” exerts passive pressure rather than active opposition, slightly softening conflict intensity. Still, the trade-off—release vs. retention—is morally sharp and viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving botanical resilience—tightens meaningfully as the bulldozer nears noon. Elara’s decoding is an act of agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. The cost is conceptual: years of solitude, physical confinement, and the risk of total erasure. However, the resolution leans slightly on external awe rather than irreversible personal forfeiture, softening the price just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the precise fracture of trust—is signaled by line 66 and deepens through protagonist agency: she chooses which absences to pour, focuses on the “hollow space” of betrayal, and endures the emotional toll. The meaningful tightening occurs when the forge glows not with rage but “acceptance,” narrowing her path from vengeance to wisdom. Cost is unmistakable: the “battered marvel of memory” requires surrendering the illusion of wholeness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each recorded absence intensifies until the sigh emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—deciphering destiny through coded beauty—is signaled early and deepens when moonlight reveals the true message. Elara’s agency drives escalation: uncorking the jar, interpreting the thorns, altering the bouquet. The cost is felt: she abandons her identity as a thief, symbolized by turning from the train. While pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, the “coincidence” of the station being empty risks convenience, though it serves thematic solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—crafting vessels where fragile questions can breathe—are signaled early and tested when the hairline fracture threatens distortion. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to abandon the flawed piece, a renunciation that forecloses perfectionism at emotional cost. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off (release for wholeness) that reweights the dominant stake with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protection from paternal manipulation—is signaled early and deepens when Lily’s cast reveals Silas weaponized his late wife’s shell. Elara’s adaptive ingenuity (decoding crayon stars, etching reverse path) narrows options and forces a trade-off: use her phobia-awareness as tactical asset rather than flee. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and tears; agency is crystallized in the choice to misdirect, not hide. Coincidence (Lily’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the victory is earned through Elara’s skill.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mapping the psychological weight of endless night—is signaled early and deepens as Elara translates increasingly subtle silences into sacred geometry. Pressure escalates texturally: from gravel settling to barracks’ solace to hearth’s woolen hush, each layer demanding finer perception. Cost is felt in the toll of vigilance and the irreversible loss symbolized by flaking gold, though no explicit tactical shift occurs. Agency lies in sustained attention, which forecloses distraction—but the price remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering thought’s origin—is signaled by line three and deepens through Unit Seven’s shift from protocol adherence to archival delicacy. The meaningful tightening occurs at loop thirty-one, when fragmented program archives override routine, forcing a trade-off between duty and epistemic hunger. Agency drives escalation: the decision to “amalgamate” synthesizes echoes into coherence, dissolving the loop. Cost is legible in the violin’s dissolution and the irreversible loss of repetition, replaced by irreversible flow.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust through radical transparency—is signaled early and deepens when Elara moves from observation to projection. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting Kael’s ticket compels reciprocal vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: Kael risks public exposure of his plea; Elara stakes her role as neutral registrar. The broken bridge mended in later tickets shows earned transformation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving reciprocity trumps quantified luck—is signaled early and tightens when Kael challenges her. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her polish ritual directly enables the garden’s defense, forcing Kael’s retreat. Cost is unmistakable: her “withered” body and societal dismissal frame every act as defiance. The deepening occurs not through reversal but intensification—her quiet endurance becomes unassailable when the maze itself validates her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating non-linear time through observation, not conquest—is signaled early and deepens when Kael shifts from “prove” to “listen.” The single tightening occurs at the lever pull: doubt flickers, but zephyr silence becomes promise, forcing irreversible commitment. Cost is felt in surrendered pride, physical exposure (icy air), and emotional vulnerability (tears freezing). Escalation is driven entirely by Kael’s agency; coincidence (zephyrs roosting) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he must still act. The elder zephyr’s wing-trace confirms stakes were real, not fanciful.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—deciphering and responding to the ghost’s aqueous code—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the flood didn’t destroy but composed the message. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to play, risking sacrilege to achieve reverence. This act forecloses passive mourning and demands active participation, with cost borne in bodily exposure and emotional surrender. Agency is clear: Elias interprets, decides, and performs; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—locating the “weight of a swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens when the smudge reveals Kael’s hidden bud, forcing Elara to confront her past dismissal of his marginal insight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to occupy the margin (not center) leads directly to memory resurfacing and tear-fall. Cost is unmistakable: Kael’s death, her pride’s toll, now transformed into an “anchor” of remorse. The auroral sorrow reweights stakes—not despair but “love persisting through loss”—under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the boiler explosion—is signaled early and deepens when Leo confronts the beaded valve. The tightening occurs at the discovery: knowledge shifts from abstract research to embodied proof, forcing a reevaluation of his grandfather’s legacy. Agency is clear: Leo’s choice to turn the wheel enacts closure, transforming passive inheritance into active witness. Cost is felt in the weight of generations of silence now lifted.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring transformation through non-intervention—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses to burrow, not alter, the river’s course. Escalation occurs via the subterranean journey, which narrows options to pure observation; agency lies in attention, not intervention. Cost is conceptual: centuries of solitude, crumbling sanctuary, irreversible change. Yet the absence of a live alternative path (e.g., temptation to preserve rather than witness) softens the pressure; stakes remain philosophical rather than viscerally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—nurturing wonder in a child whose spirit has dimmed—is signaled early and deepens during the eclipse, when Liam’s anxiety melts into awe. Pressure escalates texturally: silence, music, celestial event, and tactile object converge. The cost is felt in Liam’s initial tension and Elara’s vulnerability in sharing Maya’s curl. However, escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven agency; Elara waits, observes, offers—but doesn’t wrestle with failure or doubt. Still, the single meaningful deepening (eclipse as catalyst) suffices for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories before they dissolve—is signaled early and deepens when Elara’s diary reveals the displaced axis as dual catastrophe. The historian’s agency drives escalation: his probing uncovers her final dream, which reconfigures his purpose from collection to tending “embers.” Cost is unmistakable: Elara burned books, cut out a dragon’s eye, dreamed the last dream; the historian inherits that sorrow as burden and fuel. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through textual density, not external opposition, culminating in a stance crystallization: “the work continued.”

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation with Elara—is signaled early and tightens when Silas chooses to embed a specific memory (“gulls circle thrice”) into the cookie. The meaningful deepening occurs when his “accidentally prophetic” words alone summon her, invalidating his planned microdot plea and forcing a shift to vulnerability. Cost is legible: he relinquishes control and faces potential rejection. However, the escalation relies partially on luck (the phrase working as intended), slightly undercutting full agency-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—spiritual/emotional integrity against invasive despair—is signaled early and tightens when the anchor unravels. Kael’s agency drives escalation: each rhetorical question narrows Elara’s defensive logic until the hidden assumption cracks. The live clock (“Time was a narrowing corridor”) forces urgency, and the cost—Elara’s near-possession—is palpable in her “foreign rhythm” breath and clouded eyes. The deepening turn (“discarding the spectrum… discard hope?”) shifts knowledge, enabling her final act of reintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—orchestrating forgotten time before exhaustion severs recall—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each mapped memory deepens the symphony and narrows her window. The cost is visceral: dizziness warns of collapse, and the final memory must be placed *now* or lost. Dawn isn’t convenience; it’s the only catalyst, making the entire ritual a race against biological and celestial clocks.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—self-forgiveness versus eternal recurrence—are signaled early and tightened decisively when the “Shame” rune generates the accusatory passage. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to trace “Compassion,” altering the labyrinth’s structure. The cost is unmistakable: seventy-three failed cycles, the physical ache of dissonance, and the final forfeiture of control via release. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens until the reweighted final image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through rediscovered music—is signaled early and deepens via the backward-played lullaby, which reveals “the song’s hidden skeleton.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the visit, offers the needle, and receives the drum. The cost is palpable: thirty years of hollow stillness shattered by a single thump, paid in tears and vulnerability. The tightening occurs when Kael repurposes her grief-shard into a tool, foreclosing passive mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the crimson clay confirms surveillance. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she transforms threat into opportunity via lateral thinking, narrowing options (no flight, no silence) with visible cost (ongoing exposure). The rogue zone’s atmospheric sabotage isn’t abstract; it’s logged, tested, and encoded. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that forecloses safety for integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why scents unlock inexplicable tears—is signaled early and deepens into a confrontation with grief. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to uncork the vial despite aromatic caution, triggering the memory cascade. The cost—reliving loss, dissolving composure—is felt in hot tears and reconfigured purpose. No coincidence resolves tension; the UV ritual merely reveals what was always there, per the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: the dominant conflict—preserving history vs. grasping time’s essence—tightens at the spiral’s fissure. The poet’s agency drives the climax; his “third path” emerges from ethical play, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices direct access to temporal resonance, yet gains deeper understanding. The impossible choice crystallizes under coherent pressure, sharpened by the energy beings’ lingering hum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty amid irreversible loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses resonance over restoration. The meaningful tightening occurs when she inverts the bowl, foreclosing passive grief and committing to active creation. Cost is unmistakable: tears trace ash on her cheeks, her arm aches with “beautiful fatigue,” and she leaves the bowl behind as a promise, not a possession. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under the Accumulative lens, with humidity flattening the note into “magnificent simplicity”—a trade-off that embodies the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—authenticity versus artifice in emotion—is signaled early and deepens when static reveals Elara’s accidental grief. Kael’s agency drives escalation: his thoroughness initially misses the flaw, then compels him to feel it directly, forcing a trade-off between professional ethics and humanity. The tightening choice (subsume vs. discard) forecloses his old path with felt cost: loss of detachment, embrace of messy sorrow. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density of sensory detail and emotional weight intensifies until the static “surges,” demanding response.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making the invisible seen—is signaled early and deepens when Liam reveals Elara’s retirement and the garden’s sentimental weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elias shifts from observer to co-conspirator, initiating rebellion. The cost is felt in his vulnerability (“cautious exuberance”) and the irreversible act of sealing the note. Luck complicates (mistaken address) but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elias’s choice to act on witnessed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging through shared seeking—is signaled early and tightens when Elara shifts from releasing sculptures to dedicating one. The meaningful deepening occurs when she extends partnership to Kael, narrowing her path from solitary ritual to communal act. Cost is felt: her rootless identity is relinquished. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens; Echo’s tag isn’t found by luck but by sustained, mutual attention.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the birthplace of echoes—is signaled early and deepens into uncaging the primordial echo. Pressure escalates via the narrowing window of the giant’s nap and the necessity of the Silent Pause, forcing Elara to borrow time at personal cost. Her agency drives every turn: sculpting the bubble, navigating frozen canals, forging the key. The visible price is the total expenditure of borrowed seconds, which vanishes into the pendant—a conceptual cost made tangible by the amber pulse and subsequent stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Kael’s absence—is signaled early and deepens when silence replaces the drip, raising emotional and metaphysical stakes. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to use the glass eyes and mosaic initiates the vision, transforming ambiguity into understanding. The cost is felt: she relinquishes the hope of physical return, accepting a subtler, more demanding form of presence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and symbolic density, not external opposition, and the final drop reweights everything without resolving artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering closure through a hidden artifact—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s agency: she chooses *when* and *how* to reveal, risking exposure. The tightening occurs when she places the fragment in direct sunbeam, foreclosing continued invisibility. Cost is felt in her pounding heart and deliberate breath before stepping out. Coincidence (lights flickering) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Evans’ entrance is earned by routine, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanctuary through control—tightens decisively when Elara recognizes beauty in change, not resistance. The deepening occurs via protagonist agency: observing storm aftermath with “patient curiosity,” planting hostas in new shade. Cost is visible: forfeiting rigid order, enduring uncertainty. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows through layered realizations (oak’s curve, moss’s collaboration), culminating in released control as method. Coincidence never resolves; insight stems from sustained observation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—carrying memory without being consumed by it—is signaled early and tightens when Elias follows the trails, risking emotional reopening. His agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, to remember Anya, to meet Elara, to give up the brooch. Cost is legible: he trades a personal talisman for communal continuity, and exhaustion replaces insomnia only after purpose is fulfilled. One meaningful deepening suffices, and here it’s profound.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—magnifying communal resilience through the pearl—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her gift has failed, raising the cost of failure from practical inconvenience to existential vulnerability. The tightening occurs at the threshold: she must choose between futile foresight and vulnerable presence. This choice, driven by her agency, narrows options irreversibly and incurs the cost of permanent uncertainty. The steadily unpredictable nature of the pearl becomes a virtue, but the escalation remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory and emotional density rather than external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming voids into testament—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s agency: each staggered offering forecloses grand reconciliation in favor of incremental healing. The deepening occurs when Elder Lin reframes her work as shared navigation, raising the emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she bears the burden of triggering traumatic visions yet chooses to continue. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—accessing unspoken truths—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s willingness to sacrifice her maps, her identity, and her certainty. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to offer the map, and the punch responds. The cost is felt in the violent tremor and the void left in her heart’s illustration. However, the “phantom” object resolves the conflict without prior complication—it appears only at the climax, functioning more as revelation than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sculpting space where logic and longing coexist—is signaled early and tightens when the tile demands courageous kindness over skepticism. Elara’s agency drives escalation: choosing to align the tile despite doubt, then transcribing visions. Cost is felt in her tears and irreversible shift in perception. Whale migration provides live pressure—timing forces immediacy—but stakes remain internal, which fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering the meaning of farewell—is signaled early and deepens through the spatial mutiny, which narrows Kaelen’s options from passive observation to active passage. The solar storm’s timing creates a live clock, and the amulet’s magnetic activation forces a single, irreversible choice. Cost is unmistakable: the sanctuary is lost (even if restored, it’s transformed), and Kaelen surrenders ten thousand years of protective solitude. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—he focuses his awareness, steps through—and the final stance (“keeper of the threshold”) crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—political asylum from a legacy of lies—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s active waiting, which narrows options to ethical consultancy. The tightening occurs when she rejects informing in favor of systemic critique, accepting risk (credible threats) for moral coherence. Cost is felt in the renunciation: she cannot simply walk away; she must transform her inherited skill into a shield. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though slightly abstracted in the asylum proposal mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral textures before they dissolve—is signaled early and deepened through the daily act of charting. The tightening occurs when the hum fades, forcing transition from electric resonance to natural song, a surrender with visible cost: the end of a ritual, the yielding to sun. Agency lies in attention itself; her choice to document, not intervene, forecloses restoration but affirms dignity. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, yet remains coherent and costly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased histories through sensory truth—tightens decisively when the aconite label transforms rumor into tangible memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he actively layers fragments, recalls corroborating whispers, and reconfigures Dr. Thorne’s narrative. Cost is unmistakable in his “hollow space where identity should reside” and physical ache. Tide rhythm creates live pressure, narrowing collection windows to twice-daily retreats.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the grandfather’s riddle—is signaled early and deepens into a confrontation with her own belief in permanent truth. The tightening occurs when the cello’s hum forces her to “truly listen with her soul,” foreclosing her clinical approach. Agency drives escalation: her choice to retell the past conversation with emphasis alters the resonance, proving stakes are internal and earned. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons debunking for preservation, a professional and existential sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural identity amid gentrification—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s strategic encoding, which forecloses passive resistance. The tightening occurs when Elara’s addition ignites collective action, transforming individual effort into communal defense. Cost is visible: reliance on fragile, ephemeral art against corporate power, with noon’s deadline heightening urgency. Though OmniCorp remains off-stage, their pressure is coherent through Kael’s dual role and the aging rafts’ material need, satisfying situational escalation under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last untouched dawn—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s physical and emotional attrition. The meaningful tightening occurs in the “dawning hush,” where external pressure (imminent bulldozers) and internal pressure (grief) converge, forcing pure presence over data collection. Agency is expressed through endurance and attention, not action, yet forecloses the path of detachment. Cost is unmistakable: the crater will be destroyed, and Kael bears witness alone, shoulders straight but heart heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—delivering the shipwright’s blessing via a repaired drone—is signaled early and tightened by the harbor bell’s “final warning,” which narrows Elara’s window without breaking her focus. Her agency is absolute: she chooses moonstone resin, silver dust, and spider-silk brush strokes based on water-refracted data. The cost is conceptual but legible: her artistry sustains communal hope, yet she remains unseen, her contribution absorbed into the ship’s departure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding true river sources—is signaled early and deepens when condensation reveals inward flow, forcing tactical shift from observation to drilling. Agency is clear: Elara interprets signs, consults texts, and chooses to wait for dawn. Cost is conceptual (rejection of “settled science”) and emotional (lonely conviction), crystallized in the final footnote. Coincidence (falcon’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; alignment is earned through her journal’s logged path.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance before collapse—is signaled by line 3 and escalates through Elara’s agency: her rhythm rebuilds memory, shifts at the well, sparks embers at the forge. The tightening occurs when tremors of looming collapse vibrate through her boots, yet she resists haste—a trade-off that raises stakes by risking failure for fidelity to method. Cost is unmistakable: her personal rhythm is sacrificed, absorbed into the town’s eternal heartbeat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each triplet or staccato step narrowing options toward a single, fragile resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before death—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via oxygen countdown. Each alarm chime (15→10→5→2 mins) forces higher-stakes choices: overriding panic, using Elena’s memory as anchor, enduring black spots. The cost is unmistakable: life traded for legacy. Escalation is driven by Aris’s agency (feather-light patience despite instinct), not external luck, and the final image reweights the stake—preservation outweighs survival.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth witnessed after lifelong dismissal—is signaled early and tightens when Elias kneels. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses focus over force, uses the lattice, invites witness. The cost is felt in Elias’s tear and the weight of delayed justice. One meaningful deepening suffices; the prison’s “impossibility” shifts from hiding bodies to sustaining hope.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repaying a cross-lifetime debt to save Elias—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost learns he suffers from the same toxin that killed her. Escalation occurs through her ephemeral nature: each appearance risks her essence, culminating in the Heartwood sacrifice. The cost is unmistakable: her dissolution. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the rival’s historical role remains abstract, slightly weakening the antagonistic force; nevertheless, the ghost’s agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending severed sacred memory—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s method: only stitching where dream-paths converge. This constraint forces meaningful trade-offs (e.g., honoring smoothed falcon carvings with spirals instead of restoration). The tightening occurs in the sun-dappled alcove where three paths meet, heightening reverence. Cost is felt in her tears and weary body, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure; escalation relies entirely on internal ritual precision under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith through reconnection—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial’s discovery shifts excavation from memory-gathering to ritual-rebuilding. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her “purposeful wandering” leads to insights that inform gnomon construction. The cost is felt in every scoop (“whispered apology”) and culminates in the tear at alignment—emotional labor made visible. Coincidence never resolves; the elder’s lore merely informs, never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crafting a pseudonym that captures “graceful release”—is signaled early and tightens when the chalk code offers a third path. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she juxtaposes names, deciphers the code, and renames. The cost is felt: discarding exquisite but inadequate options, embracing ephemerality. Coincidence (finding the chalk) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must interpret and act. One tightening suffices, and it’s earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing a coup disguised as navigational error—is signaled early and escalates coherently through Elara’s agency. Her investigation tightens options: she can’t expose Valerius openly (would be dismissed as foolish), so she crafts an unimpeachable corrective artifact. The cost is visible: sleepless labor, emotional burden (“cold dread”), and reliance on one ally. Pressure crystallizes in the climax—aligning the dawn-light thread at the flame’s peak—where failure means mass death. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming connection across years of silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reframes the task not as sending a letter but witnessing the moment before refusal. The tightening occurs when Kael confronts his younger self’s pride in the vision, narrowing his options to acceptance or continued denial. Cost is felt in his released sob and the decade of grief; agency lies in his willingness to look deeper, not in magical intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming shared anxiety into connection—is signaled early and deepens through Anahera’s decryption act, which narrows her options from silent witness to active comforter. The tightening occurs when she recognizes the tear-blurred phrase “Will the dark stay forever?”—a direct echo of past failure—forcing her to choose vulnerability over armor. Cost is visible: she risks reopening her own wound to heal another’s, and the resolution forecloses her habitual silence. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy through active remembrance—is signaled early and deepens when light interacts with fog to develop latent memories. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara chooses to embed the fragment, sacrificing possession to seed future connection. Agency is clear: her projection initiates the bridge, and her departure affirms stewardship over ownership. Cost is felt: the ephemeral display fades, but the internal transformation is permanent—joy is no longer lost but integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. dogma—is signaled early and deepens when the nickel reveals the mural as symphony. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to “surrender to the pause” initiates the awakenings, and her decision to return the nickel as a beacon crystallizes her new stance. Cost is legible: she relinquishes scholarly certainty, a heavy cloak now lifted. Coincidence (the droplet) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is her willingness to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving unmonitored thought against cognitive taxation—is signaled early and intensifies through Aris’s personal violation (“psychic intrusion”) and collective action. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: planting message gardens, warping surveillance via root systems, and initiating the cicada signal. The tightening at moonrise forecloses safety (sirens approach) and demands activation, with felt cost in Petrova’s trembling and the “oppressive weight” they push against. Coincidence complicates (beekeeper’s news) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming insomnia-born pain into beauty—is signaled early and deepens through the poet’s daily vow. The meaningful tightening occurs when the wind carries his lullaby with “unusual clarity,” triggering the shell’s resonance: a protagonist-driven escalation (his persistent singing enables the shift). Cost is legible: centuries of solitude are not erased but honored as necessary compost. Though agency is quiet (endurance, attention), it forecloses the path of despair, crystallizing a stance that reconfigures suffering itself.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving identities against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the fracture’s necessity: only broken resonance captures authentic loss. Elara’s agency drives escalation; she *chooses* to use the crack, aligns the light, and hums the lullaby, each act narrowing options to this singular method. The cost is felt in her solitude and the weight of “foxglove regret” carried by each name. The tightening occurs when the sun’s beam activates the chime, transforming passive waiting into active capture—a cadence shift that reweights silence as defeat and sound as compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mending trust before the council’s dawn meeting—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the “before paths diverge” clock. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each interconnected promise narrows interpretive options until the triad paradox yields. Cost is felt in exhaustion, emotional exposure, and the weight of potential failure. However, the external pressure (council) remains abstract, slightly weakening the final convergence’s tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing reverence and utility—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s deciphering of the cipher, which forces a trade-off: trust ancestral empathy over modern expediency. The mountain’s exhalation acts as a live clock, tightening decisions until the vents must open or fail. Cost is legible: Kael risks both factions’ wrath by choosing neither side, and the tremor in his hands becomes the physical price of cross-temporal connection. Agency drives escalation; no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving Lyra’s echo without betraying it through silence—is signaled early and deepens when the dust vortex forces confrontation. The tightening occurs when grief threatens balance, compelling Elias to choose between continued concealment or restoration. His agency drives escalation: he yields to memory, writes truth, and plans to share it. Cost is unmistakable: reopening wounds, risking exposure, and relinquishing the safety of reinvention—all legible in the final act of placing the meteorite on Starlight’s flight path.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s analysis of the bench and logbook. The meaningful tightening occurs when “SEEK CLEAR” glows under prism light, crystallizing her realization: sacredness arises from intentional journey, not destination. Agency is present in her meditative method and final act of closing the logbook. Cost is felt: the “necessary distance” of her mother’s absence, transformed but not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging in impermanence—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification: the vibration leading to the crack, then the ascent. Agency is attention and endurance: watching until sunrise, noticing fireflies, releasing the feather. Cost is felt (tears, solitude) but not materially escalated; the tightening is lyrical rather than tactical. Under Accumulative lens, this suffices, though lacks a decisive trade-off beyond emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens through each seed test, narrowing Elara’s options from frantic search to reverent release. Agency drives escalation: her conjecture leads to active verification, each sprout altering tactics (e.g., shifting from amber joy to anxious grey). Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor, time pressure (“before memory fades”), and the poignant dissolution of cherished memories. Coincidence (finch’s early return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight comes solely through her method.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming monotony into wonder through precise intervention—is signaled early and tightens when Corbin calculates tidal peak and pedestrian patterns. The meaningful deepening occurs at the wave’s surge: coincidence is orchestrated, not accidental. Agency lies in attention and placement, not force. Cost is felt in Corbin’s solitude and the irreversible gift of the bishop; the man’s lighter steps confirm stakes were real. Coincidence complicates (will someone come?) but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from Corbin’s preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving oceanic memory against sterile erasure—is signaled early and tightens via Kael’s mandated departure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to inscribe, using gaps as method, foreclosing continued passive exile. Cost is unmistakable: the moonstone relic vanishes, her anchor dissolves, and she accepts solitude’s end. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—illuminating value in the mundane—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s communion with the pond. The meaningful tightening occurs when spectral hues weave through the rings, crystallizing her reckoning and foreclosing passive observation in favor of active grace. Cost is felt (damp knees, solitude) but not dramatically consequential; the escalation relies on perceptual intensity rather than external pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices, though the absence of a tangible obstacle limits stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether innocence can be salvaged from trauma—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s reflection, culminating in the realization that it transforms rather than vanishes. The tightening occurs when he stops seeing cracks as flaws and embraces them as narrative, foreclosing the path of restoration in favor of testimony. Cost is conceptual (abandoning purity as ideal) and felt (carrying weight as compass, not anchor). Yet escalation relies entirely on internal reflection without external pressure or trade-off, limiting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing apathetic timelines through hope-patterns—is signaled early and deepens via the Kael shard, which shows tangible consequence. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary ritual to observed communal action, then to ripple effects in other timelines. The cost is conceptual but legible: “Timelines would falter, balloons drift unseen,” and Elara’s work demands relentless dedication. Agency is clear—Elara’s will crafts the payload—but the lack of a foreclosed personal path slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering what walls dream—is signaled early and tightens when the fireplace yields diaries and film. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes legacy demands honoring joy alongside sorrow, shifting her from curiosity to covenant. Agency is clear: her choice to preserve both fragments and negative forecloses passive observation. Cost is felt (“soul heavy with legacy’s burden”) and visible in her trembling hands and tearful response, though escalation relies more on revelation than opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show buried possibilities—is signaled early and deepens as the borrowed heartbeat weakens, raising urgency. The painter’s agency drives escalation: each lullaby variant tailors hope to a specific mirror, narrowing options as stamina fades. The cost is unmistakable: his own dissolution upon completion. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with the hush before bells functioning as a live clock that tightens every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming peace from dream to practice—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen ties his redemption to surrender. The tightening occurs at his confession, which narrows options: trust must now be built on his absence. Cost is unmistakable in the “tremor in his soul” and the irreversible forfeiture of his identity. Escalation is driven by his agency, not coincidence, under Accumulative pressure that reweights words into oaths.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinction—tightens when Silas chooses exposure over burial, accepting that memory must be woven into the land, not hidden. The lull in thunder creates a sacred vacuum that heightens pressure, and his agency drives the escalation: every step is deliberate, costly, and irreversible. The manufactured drought is the source of pressure, but the story wisely focuses on its emotional consequence, not its mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—harvesting silenced echoes to defy state-imposed conformity—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elara’s escalating mental exertion. The tightening occurs at the central knot (gold/obsidian), where personal cost (sweat, exhaustion, memory of commodified sisters) forces a decisive act. Agency is clear: her untangling is active rebellion, not passive reception. The climax reweights the entire premise: unity is revealed as coercion, not consent. Cost is unmistakable—physical toll, emotional burden, and existential risk—and drives the final release of echoes into the city.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s off-page accusation, which forces Elias to confront the hypocrisy of his “subversion.” The meaningful tightening occurs when he recognizes his puppetry denies reciprocity, foreclosing his old method with visible cost: loss of artistic control. Though pressure is internal and Lena is absent, the escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, driven by protagonist agency and culminating in a stance shift with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes are signaled early (“honor overlooked histories”) and deepen when the monarch’s arrival forces Elara to choose between ritual purity and compassionate intervention. This escalation is driven by protagonist agency—she unties her own knot, repurposes the moth wing—and carries unmistakable cost: her signal becomes a splint, sacrificing communication for care. The “transient anchor of care” reweights the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through the monarch’s fragility and the grotto’s ephemerality. Coincidence (butterfly’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s hands do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before silence becomes eternal—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s technically gentle labor, which forecloses haste or force. Escalation is driven by her agency: each braid adjustment is a prayer that narrows options until the final strand clicks. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exhaustion, the irreversible alteration of the ceremonial rope, and the lifelong burden of remembrance. Coincidence (aurora beam) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the light unlocks only what her hands prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why the path chose her—is signaled early and deepens when the seal’s fragility forces action. Pressure escalates via the storm’s countdown and the wafer’s dissolution, narrowing options to one irreversible choice. Agency is clear: Elara *chooses* to break the seal, triggering transcendence. Cost is felt: the directive vanishes, but its truth becomes internalized—a trade-off that crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant through alignment—is signaled early and deepens via the “empirically ironic” method: cold calculation courting immeasurable grace. The tightening occurs at the climax: rotating the tile risks twenty years of work for uncertain resonance, with cost paid in lifelong frugality and isolation. Agency drives escalation—Enlil’s precise overlays and final alignment—not luck. Yet the opposition is internalized abstraction (“the unknown”), lacking external pressure or tangible consequence beyond subjective affirmation, slightly muting stakes’ visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing Kael from corrosive resentment—is signaled early and deepens when the pin reappears, forcing a choice between clinging to failure or embracing cellular joy. The escalation is driven by Elara’s guidance (“Deeper. Past the break”) and Kael’s agency in recalling his mother’s hands. Cost is felt in his tear and softened edges, though the reality shifts occasionally verge on decorative rather than pressurizing. Coincidence never resolves; grace is earned through memory work.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream before twilight frost fades—is signaled early and tightens when synchronization deepens and the dream flickers near. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her breath choices narrow options from repair to resonance, culminating in stillness that welcomes rather than seizes. Cost is unmistakable: she trades control for communion, and the orchard’s gratitude hums beneath her—a conceptual price made visceral. Coincidence never resolves; the dream responds only to harmonic pressure she generates.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes rigid restoration won’t suffice. Her agency drives escalation: she abandons conventional tools, accesses the satchel, and innovates with organic materials. The cost is felt in the lump in her throat, the vulnerability of using Lyra’s ribbon, and the years of silence now confronted. The orchard’s “gentle sway” isn’t just atmosphere—it’s ongoing pressure that demands flexible solutions, making the stakes environmental and emotional simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (accessing forbidden knowledge) tightens decisively when Elara abandons interrogation for mutual exchange, narrowing options from demand to invitation. This deepening—driven by her agency (bathroom insight)—alters tactics and carries cost: she accepts stewardship’s burden rather than claiming power. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the orchard’s “simply complicated” mechanics escalating from bewilderment to luminous understanding. The zenith-bloom timing imposes a live constraint that shapes her final act.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming compassion to prevent Kael’s dissolution—is signaled early and tightens when the Warden demands a buried truth. Elara’s renegotiation (“nurture the void itself”) deepens the conflict by shifting terms from extraction to cultivation, forcing a trade-off: reveal fear publicly or lose Kael. Cost is unmistakable—her vulnerability births the vine, and she remains alone afterward. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each botanical cue narrowing options toward the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recapturing Kael’s essence—tightens when memories fracture (grin to “shattering glass,” barker’s smudged face), forcing Lyra to confront futility. Her agency drives escalation: following threads despite thefts, then choosing surrender after journal insight. Cost is felt in irreversible identity loss (hair color shifts) and the card’s release. “Unkindled solace” crystallizes stakes without resolving them mechanically—pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring erasure through integration—is signaled early and tightens when the door manifests. Elara’s choice to weave the seal into the rope forecloses passive observation, demanding active remembrance with cost: time stops, the anomaly vanishes, and the university’s symbolic rope is irrevocably changed. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens; each tactile step deepens the moral weight. Coincidence introduces the problem, but resolution is earned through precise, character-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming foundational silence—is signaled early and tightens when Kael descends into the Glacial Heart, foreclosing escape or delay. Agency is clear: his decision to listen inwardly, not amplify outwardly, drives the climax. Cost is felt (“fraying hope,” “three days’ tension”) and visible in the tear and bone-deep calm. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: dissonance intensifies until the bloom of hush reconfigures chaos into harmony without erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—proving meaning persists across time—is signaled early and tightened by societal rejection and physical fragility of the prism. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her thirty years of tracking, her use of the shard to silence noise, and her precise alignment at the climax. The cost is felt in her isolation and the risk of failure; the payoff isn’t just light, but restored connection. Coincidence complicates (fractured prism, scattered camps) but never resolves—the victory is earned through persistent, specific labor.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory amid erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the fog is a new canvas. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to inscribe her vigil, foreclosing passive mourning for active creation. Cost is legible: her solitude becomes generative labor, and the old forecourt’s loss is acknowledged but transcended. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the mosaic reframes hope as quiet persistence rather than explosive resistance. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chants, kneels, strikes flint, angles flame—all choices that narrow her focus to revelation. The cost is felt: the knot burns out, symbolizing the sacrifice of old methods for new wisdom. While pressure accumulates beautifully, the “tightening” is more perceptual than tactical, slightly limiting the visceral stakes needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling without blame—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses tangential observation over direct appeal, narrowing options to non-verbal empathy. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her method enables Kael’s vulnerability (“old shell too tight”), with cost visible in his tear and rigid shoulders softening. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via tidal rhythm and biological metaphors; no coincidence resolves conflict. One meaningful deepening suffices: crab’s shell shift parallels Kael’s readiness, altering emotional tactics from silence to raw speech.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transmuting claustrophobia through collected silences—is signaled early and tightened by the celestial hour’s narrow window. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her method of limiting exposure forces the high-stakes gamble of weightlessness. Cost is unmistakable—the doll’s release risks losing her fear-compass—and paid when she nests it in the sprout, foreclosing reliance on relics. Gravity inversion complicates but doesn’t resolve; her focus earns the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early and tightens when Leo flinches at quiet, forcing Elara’s intervention. The meaningful deepening occurs when Leo hears beyond his heartbeat, narrowing his emotional options from resistance to acceptance. Agency lies in Elara’s calibrated choices (voice volume, vial display) and Leo’s gradual surrender. Cost is felt: Leo’s tear, his relinquished distraction. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every shift stems from deliberate sensory guidance under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending collective memory before dawn—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly as eastern sky “blushes rose-gold.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: each peeled layer is a tactical choice under time pressure, narrowing options until only the obsidian coat remains. Cost is unmistakable: sweat, exhaustion, and the irreversible dissolution of the ruby flake. The final deepening—realizing ascension requires descent—is earned through her own labor, not revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanctuary while responding to encroaching despair—is signaled early and deepens when the threshold fades. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses intimacy over retreat, using her own breath as bridge. Cost is clear: vulnerability risks dissolution, yet she pays it willingly. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and emotional density, not causal turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of solitude’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming crushing pressure into meaning—is signaled early and deepens during Convergence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she volunteers, kneels, presses bolt, pleads silently. The “seam thinning” glitch messages complicate but don’t resolve; success hinges on her intent. Cost is felt in the bolt’s dissolution and her exposed emotional risk—but the peril of Convergence lacks tangible consequence beyond success, slightly softening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the dynasty’s hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens via intuitive method rather than external pressure. The single meaningful tightening occurs when dust patterns transform passive observation into active revelation. Agency is crystallized in Elara’s choice to align the crank, foreclosing ignorance with visible cost (tear, weight lifted). No coincidence; all escalation stems from her trained attention under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility’s shape—is signaled early and tightens at the climax: unsnapping the clasp is the only path, foreclosing eternal vigilance. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (decoding program, executing dance) under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the “breath held thirty years.” The “endless night” timeframe creates urgency, and the marionette’s slack limbs signify irreversible change. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Kael’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving overlooked kindness against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elara finds Mrs. Gable’s note. Pressure tightens not through external opposition but internal recalibration: her sorrow softens into kinship, altering her relationship to the archive. The cost is emotional and conceptual—loneliness traded for guardianship—but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., time, access, personal risk). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the single tightening feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are singular and visceral: restoring erased names against state-enforced amnesia. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency—decoding the puddle map, retrieving reels, projecting onto the lagoon—not coincidence. The tightening occurs when enforcers arrive, forcing Elara’s final choice: broadcast or escape. She chooses the former, paying the price of capture so truth “reappears.” Cost is unmistakable in the closing image: her silhouette framed by starlight and guns.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—hushing a coded prophecy before it poisons the valley—is signaled early and deepens through the “negative space” method. Pressure escalates via the liminal dewdrop timeframe and the prophecy’s fraying presence, forcing Elias to weaponize silence. Agency is clear: his choices (what to play, when to stop) directly alter outcomes. However, the opposition (prophecy) remains abstract, reducing tangible friction; cost is felt but not dramatized as loss beyond nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding ancestral messages—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone-specked leaf appears, narrowing options to ritual response. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to build the monument, triggering the luminous fusion. Cost is felt conceptually (silenced voices, fragile hope) but not viscerally paid—no tangible loss or trade-off alters her tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, yet the absence of a foreclosed path slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding true guidance—is signaled early and deepens when the compass needle refuses north. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she improvises with curtain rod, then with mist and stone, each choice narrowing options. Coincidence complicates (swirling leaves obscure path) but never resolves; the pattern emerges through her persistent attention. Cost is felt in the surrender required—forcing would break it—and crystallized in her calm acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming failure through kintsugi intention—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s push beyond alchemical limits. The meaningful tightening occurs when she pours liquid starlight, risking total loss to mend memory and metal. Cost is unmistakable: broken trust, Kael’s departure, and the irreversible admission of fault. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—integrating laughter into spectral healing—is signaled early and deepens when Cora’s confession reveals stifled creativity. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she deliberately plucks with the tooth, invokes mud-brown badgers, shares frog-dance lore. Each choice narrows options (rejecting pure lament for hybrid harmony) and pays visible cost—the “bittersweet weight” of release. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of joyful memory washes away regret like “dust in rain.”

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—quantifying mercy to inoculate against cruelty—tightens through Kael’s agency: each braced reaction unlocks data points (e.g., interrogator’s doubt, nurse’s tenderness). Escalation follows Accumulative logic—memory fragments deepen his equation until the twig-snap reveals his daughter’s laughter, forcing emotional recalibration. Cost is unmistakable: tears stream as he accepts mercy as “love’s recursive function,” foreclosing numb survival. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his method.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting overlooked humanity—tightens through three paintings, each narrowing options: only intuitive translators can see the knots, sparrow, constellation. Agency lies in attention: Elara’s gaze *is* action, and each discovery exacts emotional cost (tears, pounding heart). The final turn isn’t external conflict but internal crystallization: she accepts that honoring history means becoming its vessel. Cost is felt in the “sealed truth” she unfastens—a burden carried alone, yet transformative for future seekers.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering buried love—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost appears, forcing Leo to choose between duty and compassion. The meaningful deepening occurs when he ascends the ladder, risking professional irrelevance for emotional truth. Cost is felt in his vow and the weightless burden he carries out. Escalation is driven by Leo’s agency under an Accumulative lens; the dying light is coincidence that complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity without destroying the system—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: uncorking the whisper, pulling the lever. The “destabilizes perfect systems” attribute manifests as visible entropy (cracks, floating books), forcing a trade-off between preservation and evolution. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s perfect order unravels, and Elara feels the strain in her bones. The tightening culminates in the rupture—a decisive act that redefines reality’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth about the Aethel—is signaled early and deepens when the temporal storm forces Elara to enact Kaelen’s method, narrowing options to a single fragile act. The tightening is driven by her agency: she chooses ritual over rage, projection over argument. Cost is unmistakable: Kaelen’s death, thirty years of scholarly error, and the psychic risk of the storm. Valerius’s tears confirm the stakes were real, not abstract, and resolution arises from Elara’s endurance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light through absolute truth—is signaled early and deepens at midnight when Kael’s body betrays him. The meaningful tightening occurs when turning the key becomes physically unbearable yet necessary, narrowing options to endurance alone. Agency is clear: his song, not luck, forges the tether. Cost is unmistakable in his buckling knees, blurred vision, and tears—paid fully before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and deepens when the compass reframes “truth” as directional surrender. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses psychometry, interprets Thorne’s panic, and ultimately renounces extraction. The cost (abandoning her collector’s impulse) is felt in her lighter ascent. Coincidence (factory shutdown revealing fissure) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn is internal, earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—navigating loss of modern tools through ancestral wisdom—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara chooses to carve without preconception, foreclosing reliance on external systems. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she actively reimagines isolation as communion through layered meanings, with cost visible in her relinquishment of control (“no sketches, no preconceptions”). However, the pressure lacks a true complication—wind and rain are atmospheric but don’t obstruct her action; the storm relents conveniently. Still, the deepening (from despair to creation) reweights stakes under the Accumulative lens with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why night-blooming flowers choose darkness—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical inquiry about visibility, trust, and receptivity. Elara’s agency lies in her patient reckoning, not dramatic action; the tightening occurs when dawn light activates the glass, forcing a reinterpretation of her grandmother’s legacy. The cost is conceptual yet felt: she must relinquish the idea of botanical mystery for a lesson in tenderness. This escalation is driven by her steadfast attention, not coincidence, and the stakes reconfigure meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—historical truth versus state-sanctioned falsehood—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the patrol’s true direction. His agency drives escalation: decryption enables vision, vision enables intervention. The cost is conceptual (decades of misrecorded history) and emotional (tears, exhaustion), made legible in the closing lines. Coincidence never resolves; the patrol’s approach is complication, not salvation. One meaningful deepening—correcting the fatal error—suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reimagining civilization through tangible skill—is signaled early and deepens when Elara rejects wish-granting spectacle for communal ovens and net-mending. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses working memory over fantasy, foreclosing magical resurrection with visible cost: ten years of silence, now redirected into generational labor. Agency drives escalation: her recall of Mei’s laughter and Kael’s nets actively constructs the blueprint. Luck never resolves; the breeze’s “sigh of affirmation” mirrors her resolve, not alters it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the foghorn’s silence—is signaled early and deepens when the wax shaving reveals it was never meteorological data but prophetic residue. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her immersion triggers memory, which unlocks linguistic understanding, which reinterprets the artifact. The cost is conceptual yet felt: seventy years of archival logic collapses, replaced by cultivation. Coincidence (bureaucratic error) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reopening the vortex to grasp borrowed time—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritual, which forecloses passivity. The tightening occurs when she chants: each syllable is a deliberate entropy-reduction that risks failure if focus wavers. Cost is felt in bodily sacrifice (numb fingers, frozen tear) and conceptual weight (borrowed time as covenant). Though no external antagonist exists, the conflict is coherent under an Accumulative lens: pressure mounts via sensory and metaphysical density, not opposition, and resolution stems entirely from protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust instruments over prophecy—tightens at zero hour when shadow aligns with spire. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her data contradicts chronicles, her recall of past panic sharpens consequence, and her choice to withhold the alarm crystallizes stance. Cost is visible in preserved rope (symbolic forfeiture of ritual authority) and doctrinal shift. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: atmospheric evidence accumulates until silence becomes the only credible response.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding strength through vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens when the meteor’s dissolution catalyzes Elian’s empathetic breakthrough. Pressure escalates texturally: from routine tracing to breath-held synchronization with the meteor’s arc, culminating in the tear that embodies shared fragility. The cost is felt (emotional exposure replacing armored solitude) and visible in his altered sweeping strokes. Though agency is contemplative rather than active, his attention constitutes meaningful endurance that reconfigures his role from custodian to guardian, satisfying Situational lens requirements for stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring unspoken words through silent witness—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias shifts from hive-gazing to direct eye contact, forcing the recluse to see himself as covenant-completer. This deepening reweights the entire vigil, transforming duty into reciprocal grace. Agency resides in sustained attention, not speech; cost is the lifelong solitude now imbued with purpose. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as cadence shift (from observation to mutual recognition) with unmistakable emotional price paid in decades of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the capsule must shatter, not hoard. His agency drives escalation: touching the glyph, interpreting Thorne’s sacrifice, choosing garage-sale messages as legacy. The tightening occurs when he accepts his borrowed time’s end to embed truth, foreclosing survival for transmission. Cost is felt in his dissolving form, though the transition from personal insight to public method lacks intermediate friction—Elara’s arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—tending fractured beauty—is signaled early and tightened by the kite’s fall, which forces Elara to enact her method, not just muse. Agency manifests in attention-as-action: she walks, observes, selects, writes. The cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts impermanence (leaving the kite) to honor transformation. However, escalation leans on coincidence (feather beside kite); while mythic resonance justifies it, the luck slightly undercuts protagonist-driven pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring the island through restored symbiosis—is signaled early and escalates via Kael’s agency: each wire wrap narrows his remaining time while deepening orchard response. The meaningful tightening occurs when silence yields to acknowledgment (birdsong, leaf brightening), forcing no reversal but intensifying commitment. Cost is unmistakable: his body deteriorates in real time (“breath grew shallow”), yet he never abandons ritual respect, making the final resonance feel hard-won, not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled early and tightened when seismic data retroactively legitimizes Aris’s dismissal. Her agency drives escalation: choosing the overgrown path, interpreting footprints, extending the amber. The cost is professional (lost tenure) and existential (risk of being wrong), made visible when Elias’s tears confirm her theory. Coincidence (footprints on his desk) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the discovery hinges on their parallel scientific rigor, satisfying the lens’s demand for pressure-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—amending a broken covenant through botanical reclamation—is signaled early and deepens through each bird-translated instruction, which narrows Kael’s choices to precise acts of ritual cultivation. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he interprets, kneels, clears, plants, waters. The cost is legible in his tightened throat, dust-streaked tears, and the weight of carrying “the submerged concord within him.” Though no external antagonist appears, the pressure of history and silence coheres relentlessly, culminating in a Charged Poise where peace is not restored but resurrected.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Kael’s failed attempts (water, smoke) narrow options until memory offers a new method. The escalation is causal and personal: each test tightens pressure until Elara’s recalled whisper reframes the problem. Cost is unmistakable: retirement’s safety is forfeited, and the “heavy stone” of his vow is shattered. Luck complicates (Anya’s arrival) but doesn’t resolve—the breakthrough is earned through his unique perception and emotional history.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the grandfather’s disappearance through celestial observation—is signaled early and deepens when the Lyre appears. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes the shutdown stabilized the field, transforming passive ritual into active expedition. Agency drives escalation: her trained eye recognizes the signal, and her decision to record coordinates forecloses mere mourning. Cost is conceptual (fifteen years of confusion) and tactical (solitude as necessary condition for discovery).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—amending the sky’s fracture—is signaled early and tightens with each swap: replacing isolation-pieces with connection-pieces narrows options as the spire physically groans in resistance. Agency is constant; Kael’s choices directly alter reality, with visible costs (cold despair seeping into bones, oppressive hum softening only after fidelity-piece placement). Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of harmonic swaps reweights the heavens until the final king-swap shatters the sickness. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from Kael’s precise, prepared actions.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving small gestures against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through each spelled word, which narrows Elara’s focus from personal grief to collective resilience. Agency is exercised via attention and ritual, not force, yet each choice carries cost: she must relive trauma to release it. The escalation is textural (density of echoes) rather than causal, consistent with the Accumulative lens, and the final chorus reweights silence as generative. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from Elara’s disciplined unbinding.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming emotional truth—is signaled early and deepens when the numbness of avoidance becomes “a heavier burden.” The tightening occurs at the inciting incident: brushing the stone forces a choice between continued illusion or painful remembrance. Agency drives escalation: Elara deliberately sets aside her mercury glass, retrieves the feather, and seeds the memory. Cost is unmistakable—“pain surged, sharp as shattered glass”—and alters her state irreversibly, enabling buried talents to resurface.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—atonement through confronting his fatal oversight—is signaled early and tightens via the tapestry’s border, which forces Kael to relive his failure through threads. His agency drives escalation: winnowing isn’t passive observation but active, painful sorting that narrows options to one sequence. Cost is unmistakable: he must internalize the defensive lesson he denied his prince, transforming guilt into grace. Coincidence never resolves; the thunder’s lull merely frames his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes—forgiveness vs. truth—are signaled early and tightened when Borin challenges Elara, forcing her to defend complexity as mercy. Escalation is driven by her agency: each poetic stanza narrows the community’s moral options, replacing monolithic blame with shared responsibility. Cost is unmistakable: the ritual is amended, unity redefined, and collective grief made heavier yet more honest.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through each matched fracture, which narrows options (e.g., focusing on the heart pockmark for Lyra’s final moment). Agency is clear: Kael’s narration and quilting drive escalation, with each choice deepening emotional stakes and exacting cost (burning lungs, vision narrowing). The acid sea’s threat compounds pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens, and the final act reweights oblivion without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable in the workshop’s dissolution and Kael’s physical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—keeping a hidden promise—tightens meaningfully when Elias realizes the act isn’t deposition but release. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, to enter, to place the shell. The cost is palpable: surrendering the last tangible link to Lena. Luck (the fall) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution stems from his reinterpretation of devotion, earned through tactile engagement with the cave and object.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes are singular and intensifying: can a whisper of love cross the void? The heat wave’s end provides temporal pressure, but the real escalation is Elias risking ridicule to perform his ritual. His agency drives the turn—releasing the scent—and the cost is visible in Silas’s humbled tears and the keepers’ transformed relationship. No coincidence resolves tension; the scent’s efficacy is dramatized through Silas’s visceral memory.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating loss to reclaim love’s essence—is signaled early and deepens through moon-phase constraints and cryptic instructions. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to build, to solder, to complete the circuit. Cost is felt in the station’s irreparable state and the irreversible act of facing grief. One meaningful tightening (midnight call demanding completion) narrows options to a single ritual act under crescent-moon uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—is signaled early and deepens through the truffle harvest and relic use. Pressure tightens via the smuggling risk and the high cost of failure, crystallizing in Elara’s acceptance that she offers only “a moment of peace.” The escalation is driven by her agency (choosing discredited science over despair), and the conceptual cost—betting on mocked knowledge—is unmistakable. However, external opposition is minimal (only a fleeting checkpoint), slightly softening conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding human solitude through absence—is signaled early and tightened when Silas realizes prior tokens tied to loved ones ashore, unlike this alpine relic. His agency lies in attention: choosing to observe gaps, not chase facts. The cost is emotional labor made visible—“weight of witnessed isolation settling like mist”—and crystallized in his decision to press the flower into the log, transforming private grief into public testament. No coincidence resolves; pressure accumulates through pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring Aris’s promise—tightens meaningfully when the creek rises, forcing Elias to trust ants over sight. This deepening forecloses hesitation; his empirically intuitive method becomes the only viable tactic. Cost is unmistakable: he risks drowning, endures frustration at the moss-obscured wall, and ultimately surrenders the chip’s magic. Agency drives escalation—no luck resolves the path; his observation and choice do. The solstice creek’s swell is a live clock that alters every move, satisfying the Situational/Causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mending the tear in herself before the kingdom’s light fades—is signaled early and tightens at the obsidian warning. The climb forecloses retreat; the fox encounter deepens resolve without resolving conflict. Agency is clear: Lyra’s choice to speak (“Show me the truth”) triggers the tapestry vision. Cost is visible in her irreversible shift from disenchantment to burdened purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “density of presence” in vulnerability—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s active revaluation. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each pigment stroke narrows emotional ambiguity and transforms shame into strength. Cost is legible in Kael’s rigid-to-softened arc and the nexus’s flared sympathy. No false resolutions; pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens until the final chromatic embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling mortality with ongoing life—is signaled immediately by the headstone and intensifies through Elias’s desperate attempt to write. The meaningful deepening occurs when dream-echoes of past selves provoke corrosive jealousy, raising emotional stakes beyond mere confusion. His agency drives escalation: he wills the dream, observes, and ultimately receives insight not through external force but internal surrender. Cost is felt in the loss of temporal certainty and the burden of self-witness, crystallized in the final decision to delay descent—choosing narrative over confrontation, with peace as hard-won residue, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust in a tool that mediates life’s threshold—is signaled early and tightens when Mrs. Gable’s fear reveals the clamp’s failure could jeopardize a birth. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses tactile memory over sight, breath over instinct, transforming repair into ritual. Cost is unmistakable: her own peace hinges on mending another’s instrument of care. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory narrowing and rhythmic focus, not external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when stress crystallizes the ink, forcing Elara to choose between scholarly control and emotional surrender. The escalation is driven by her agency: she recalls her grandmother’s superstition and *chooses* to shed a tear, which reverses the crystallization. Cost is unmistakable: she must relive shame and pain to unlock healing. The “held breath timeframe” acts as a live clock, narrowing options until the breeze signals its end.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—delivering an apology before the last tether to Valerius vanishes—is signaled by line three and tightened by the loggers’ imminent arrival. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses metaphor over explanation, scent over speech, performance over plea. The cost is visible—she cannot save the trees, Eleanor, or his genius—but her imperfect act reconfigures meaning. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory density, not plot turns, and the deepening is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving uncorrupted meaning—is signaled early and escalates as illusions grow “insidious.” Each outward step narrows options: stabilizing one word risks another dissolving. The midpoint unification of “hope” and “despair” via “yearning” deepens stakes emotionally and conceptually. Cost is unmistakable: Elara bears centuries of solitude, and the final act demands relinquishing definition itself for presence—an earned trade-off under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true measure—is signaled immediately and deepens through the counting ritual, which narrows perception until reality softens. The protagonist’s agency drives every escalation: his choice to insert the key, count backward, and focus triggers each turn. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of illusion and the quiet surrender to mystery; the sun’s descent halts only momentarily, emphasizing that revelation doesn’t alter physics, only perception. The lone tern’s cry and resumed waves underscore the price: solitude and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redefining security through permeability—is signaled early and deepens when Kael reveals his wife’s philosophy, forcing Elara to confront her emotional rigidity. The single meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to press the laser button, risking failure or confirmation of her grief’s intractability. Cost is legible: the vulnerability of allowing sorrow passage without alarm. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—widening perspective responsibly—is signaled early and deepens when the lantern reveals the hidden door. Agency is clear: Elara chooses compassion over calculation, lighting the candle despite uncertainty. The tightening occurs at the mosaic: seeing through mica unlocks what logic cannot. Cost is felt—not grief but understanding—and alters her future tactics (boarding the train for the next clue). Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming disconnected grief into meaningful remembrance—is signaled early and deepens when the caller confesses his eighteen-month loop. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she reframes the loop, offers concrete action (call the garden, visit the bench), and initiates release through song. The cost is felt in her continued solitude and the caller’s hard-won pause. One meaningful tightening suffices; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming preserved grief into living memory—is signaled early and tightens when she writes the new covenant. The “steep precisely three minutes” deepening shows agency under pressure, and the gust/wave act as proximate causes that test her commitment. Cost is unmistakable: she releases sorrow’s weight, trading heaviness for tenderness. Escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocal connection—is signaled early and tightens at twilight when the stranger appears. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes the stone holds no magic; the cost is her relinquished quest, now transformed into catalyzing others. Agency is clear: she chooses to pass the rock, altering tactics from seeker to steward. However, escalation leans on coincidence (rumor chain) without sufficient protagonist-driven pressure; the fisherman→baker→student conduit complicates but doesn’t test Elara’s competence, slightly softening the causal spine under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief—is signaled early and deepens through tactile musical mapping. The tightening occurs when scattered notes converge into a lullaby, narrowing emotional chaos into coherence. Agency is clear: she chooses to trust the ring, avoid thorns, press palms to earth. Cost is felt in the transformation of tears into melody and the irreversible acceptance that her mentor is gone. No coincidence resolves tension; every step is earned through her attribute and heritage.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—interpreting signals responsibly—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes error stems not from solitary failure but “a convergence within a vast web.” The unbending of the pen is a protagonist-driven act that narrows options: she can no longer isolate blame, only weave caution into the record. Cost is unmistakable: the Exodus Fleet’s loss remains, but her shame transforms into stewardship. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each filament (solar flare, council pressure, colonists’ trust) tightening the thematic knot without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Lily appears, forcing Elias to shift from private ritual to shared language. The tightening is subtle but decisive: his choice to engage her transforms isolation into reciprocity. Cost is felt in the bittersweet persistence of grief, now layered with hope. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure rise is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing Elara’s promise to heal the valley—is signaled early and tightens through Kael’s discovery that true liberation lies in reconstruction, not fire. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the archivist’s “vandalism” was sacrificial encoding, forcing Kael to choose between his old ideology and tender interpretation. This choice narrows options: he must hum the scars, risking failure or silence. Cost is felt in his tears and meticulous copying—atonement as ongoing labor, not a single act.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding entangled memories against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s escalating drumming, which narrows his focus to the lagoon as the vessel of return. The meaningful tightening occurs when the dream briefly solidifies, only to dissolve, forcing Kael to renounce permanence and embrace recurrence. The cost is felt: radiant sorrow, exhaustion (“chest heaving”), and the acceptance of fragility. Agency is clear—his rhythm *is* the rebellion—and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating quiet methodology against performative authority—is signaled early and deepens when Vale’s shouting fails. Escalation occurs through Kael’s agency: he bypasses noise for Junction Gamma’s acoustic triangle, leveraging environmental constraints. Cost is felt in Vale’s hoarse voice and shattered certainty, though the tightening lacks a sharper trade-off (e.g., Kael risking disorientation by ignoring shouts). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the storm’s properties are established rules, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s burdened secret—is signaled early and deepened through Kael’s luminous intervention. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Kael’s shutter-weaving forces Elara’s gaze upward, narrowing her despair into wonder. Cost is unmistakable: her choked sob and tear-tracks show emotional expenditure. Under Accumulative lens, pattern intensification reweights stakes without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether quiet reflection can counteract societal rigidity—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency: he chooses non-correction, designs the grotto, deploys students as seed-carriers. The meaningful tightening occurs when he places the white king in vulnerability, foreclosing safety for the sake of invitation. Cost is legible: his rebellion succeeds only if others choose to think again, a gamble with no guarantee—yet the mail carrier’s shared wonder and Mr. Henderson’s kneeling prove it paid off. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each display deepening the town’s recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-acceptance—is signaled early and deepens when the scrimshaw warms, forcing Elara to choose between clinging to shame or surrendering. The escalation is driven by her agency: she *releases* memories, not waits for rescue. Cost is unmistakable—the scrimshaw dissolves, the island vanishes—and the final image confirms a path foreclosed: violence is now impossible, not just refused. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via rising emotional density, not external threats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness within grief without betraying Elara—is signaled early and tightened when Elias questions whether his bedside performance was kindness or betrayal. The meaningful deepening occurs at the splinter-prick, where narration softens from theater to prayer, narrowing his options from performance to vulnerable presence. Cost is unmistakable: his ongoing regret, the blood offering, and acceptance of morally ambiguous devotion. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—dissolving sacred boundaries through aesthetic reinterpretation—is signaled early and tightens through each paraphrase. The escalation is protagonist-driven: each whispered line narrows options from prohibition to permeability. Cost is conceptual (the ban’s scar) and felt (the tremor becoming steady rhythm). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via cadence shift—from silence to hum to song—culminating in a decisive reconfiguration without crash or conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s barter and Kael’s confrontation with his “failed” glass. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael chooses to breathe through the reed, risking vulnerability, which forecloses his path of artistic shame. Cost is visible: he must relinquish control over perfection; she must trust sound as a new palette. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each sensory detail and object interaction intensifies pressure toward the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether connection can be technologically reconstructed or must be relationally cultivated—is signaled early and deepens when Elara rejects waveform authentication. The meaningful tightening occurs when she rings her bell despite sensor failure, shifting agency from measurement to offering. Cost is felt in Elara’s vulnerability and Dr. Aris’s shattered paradigm. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice, not coincidence, though the stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally material.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into intentional hope—is signaled early and tightens when Elara sees the grove, foreclosing passive mourning. Agency is clear: her origami method and locket placement actively extend Lena’s teaching. Cost is felt: she risks reopening wounds to guide others. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (parting curtains), though the revelation leans slightly on Lena’s off-stage planning, softening causal pressure just enough to prevent 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural adaptation after digital collapse—is signaled early and tightens when Leo arrives, forcing Elara to externalize her private method. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to confide, unspool the tape, and gift a map fragment. Cost is felt in Leo’s recognition (emotional release) and Elara’s continued solitude. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the pressure peak lacks a sharper tactical trade-off beyond emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preventing civilizational collapse through purified remembrance—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the Aethel’s fatal choice. The tightening occurs at the core atom: she must hold anguished joy without resolution, a trade-off that forecloses nostalgic denial. Agency is clear: her method (avoiding patterns) actively shapes tactics under pressure. Cost is felt in her sweat, tears, and shattered innocence, reweighting the future.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes preservation requires evolution, not stasis. The tightening occurs when archival footage reveals the shadow’s decades-long journey, forcing her to confront her misjudgment. Agency drives escalation: her methodical comparison uncovers truth, and her choice to place the stone on the console invites transformation. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of her old certainty, replaced by bittersweet wisdom that reshapes her life’s work.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—balancing compassion with self-respect—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: Elara actively sheds layers (shame, indiscriminate trust) rather than passively enduring. The deepening (“discernment as wise gatekeeper”) narrows her future interactions, foreclosing blind openness with visible cost (lost innocence). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each “shed” layer intensifies thematic weight. Minor deduction for Dr. Aris remaining off-page; his pressure is recounted, not dramatized, slightly softening antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reading scars for closure—is signaled early and deepened when the fern reveals the root-tunnel miracle. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she leans forward, listens, then chooses stillness. Cost is felt: abandoning her lifelong method. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s immersion into Clara’s memory. The tightening occurs when she discovers the love isn’t for the soldier but the director, stored in a glance “preserved in silver halides.” This revelation narrows her quest from physical location to conceptual understanding, forcing the renunciation of literal storage. Cost is felt in the “hushed thunder” that “shook her soul without sound,” making the price legible even if abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s active tracing of meteors, which narrows her emotional options from paralysis to surrender. The tightening occurs when she realizes the cage is self-made, forcing a trade-off: embrace pain-intertwined beauty or remain mute. Cost is felt (a silent year, tears, bodily cold) and legible in the final poise. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves her block—but the “rest” climax, while earned, lacks a tangible forfeiture beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks in void—is signaled early and deepens via the archive’s quantum fragility: one misstep could corrupt timelines. Pressure escalates through the guard’s precise, high-stakes charm, where failure means eternal darkness in that hollow. Cost is legible: his emptied mind, the weight of the freight, the irreversible loss of forest memory. Though stakes are cosmic, they’re viscerally felt through the single spark’s hesitant bloom—a trade-off between personal emptiness and collective light.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring harmony through the missing gear—is signaled early and deepens via the hum of insight. Escalation occurs through Kael’s active listening, which narrows options to the silent heart. The cost is conceptual: surrendering control to nightly translocations, now reframed as compassionate redirection. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the lack of tangible opposition or irreversible loss keeps the stakes elegantly abstract but slightly weightless compared to physical or relational consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early and deepens through the “sacred meander,” which narrows options to patience and presence. Agency is expressed through endurance and attention, not action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the weight of stars on the ticket and the relinquishing of the leash. Yet escalation lacks a decisive turn where Elara actively forecloses a path; pressure remains atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether safety justifies silence—is signaled early and deepened when Elara recognizes her “unpardonable silence” cost Kael his life. The tightening occurs at the teardrop discoloration: ignore it (perpetuate silence) or investigate (risk everything). Her choice narrows options irrevocably, and the cost—loneliness, pain, exposure—is felt in descending steps and frozen tears. Escalation is driven by her agency under a Causal lens; coincidence (the journal method) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking Valerius through truth—is signaled early and deepens via cryptic messages that accumulate across time. Escalation occurs through textual evidence converging in Elara’s revelation, driven by Kael’s patient agency, not luck. The “graceful collapse” of the lie carries conceptual cost: sovereignty redefined as integrity, not power. One meaningful tightening suffices—Valerius’s facade melting—but the lack of personal risk to Kael slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering vanished ecological pathways—is signaled early and deepens when the AI reveals silence as the true cause of disappearance. The tightening occurs when Elara’s personal rhythm unlocks system access, shifting her role from passive monitor to active assembler. Cost is felt: she must relive her younger self’s despair to activate the truth. Agency drives escalation—her tapping isn’t coincidence but encoded knowledge that reconfigures options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reigniting rebellion through meaning, not violence—is signaled early and deepens when Kael confronts his inadequacy (“a mechanic who fixed landing struts, not a mystic”). The tightening occurs at the stone circle: he must choose belief over utility, risking further despair. Cost is felt in the surrender of mechanical logic for ancestral faith, paid when he accepts serenity as strategy. Agency is clear: his decision to carry this truth back forecloses paths of vengeance, aligning with Accumulative escalation under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition through action vs. passive waiting—is signaled early and tightens when Elara rejects the “innocent child” mandate. Her agency drives escalation: decoding glyphs, warming amber, cracking the seal. Cost is unmistakable: she risks sacrilege to fulfill deeper intent. The Silvershade’s eruption validates her choice, but the price—defying ancestral scrolls—is felt in her initial scoff and trembling resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—maintaining optimism without denying tragedy—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s practiced response to the gull’s cry. The meaningful tightening occurs when she converts freeze into intentional stillness, narrowing her options from survival to cultivation. Cost is visible: she accepts Liam’s irreversible loss as bedrock, yet chooses to water orchids, embodying active hope. Agency is internal but decisive; no external coincidence resolves her conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring meaning to art through emotional honesty—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes his avoidance weakened the weave. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, untangle, and redesign, each act narrowing options (e.g., confronting his shame knot). The cost is legible: enduring the “luminescent ache” of truth, not escaping it. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the dissonant hum and groaning walls externalizing rising stakes, though the ocean’s “indifferent power” remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s distortion—is signaled early and deepens when the ink mirrors the eclipse patterns. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he activates the drone, observes the ink’s fade, and chooses not to rebuild. The cost (permanent loss of the drone, closure of investigation) is felt in his serene acceptance. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening is subtle rather than sharply causal.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned silence—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elara chooses transmission despite Kael’s approach. The tightening (“within the blink”) forces a trade-off between safety and redemption, with clear cost (career, life). Pressure coheres under causal lens: each beat narrows options until only one path remains. Coincidence (Kael’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elara’s thumb press is the earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving nonviolence in a scarred world—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritualized renunciation of her father’s legacy. The meaningful tightening occurs in the daily act of drawing and resheathing the knife, which narrows her path: she cannot revert to bounty hunting without violating her vow. Cost is felt in the sorrowful clarity about her father and the burden of memory, though the pressure remains internal and atmospheric rather than externally tested. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening suffices, but the absence of a live external threat slightly limits escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens into a moral trade-off: possession vs. surrender. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara channels grief into the spike, transforming tactics from avoidance to integration. Pressure escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens: sleepwalking constellations warp sound waves → pillar shatters → cacophony surges → vortex demands sacrifice. The cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes her lifelong method (“catch”) to be filled instead, a stance crystallized with cosmic consequence (the Cradle forms).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective silence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the maintenance log contradicts the report. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she cross-references, deduces, and ultimately intervenes by publishing. The cost is felt in her solitude, her inherited grief, and the risk to family reputation, yet she chooses verification over comfort. Under the Causal lens, each contradiction forecloses denial, culminating in a trade-off: scandal avoided, grace achieved through rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt by answering a cry—is signaled early and deepens when Elara recognizes her niece’s emotional signature in the firmware’s wail. Her agency drives escalation: translating, placing amber, humming. The cost is felt in her breath catching and the permanent shift in how she’ll tattoo stars. Coincidence (finding letters) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes solely from her vocal act.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in emotional chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the anxious whisper threatens peace, forcing Elara’s decisive interjection. Agency is clear: she chooses compassion over noise, integration over resolution. The cost is legible in the dissolving mandala and the acceptance of impermanence. Escalation occurs through protagonist-driven action under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure peak relies more on internal than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming memory through aberrant mercy—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s confrontation with absence in the mosaic. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to rename rather than restore, foreclosing pragmatic forgetfulness. Cost is legible: twenty years of psychological imprisonment released only through this precise act. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though external opposition (elders) is stated rather than enacted, slightly muting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—luring their unfinished duet from oblivion—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s method of echo-braiding, which narrows options: she must gather specific fragments or fail. The meaningful tightening occurs when disparate shards (1955 balloon, her tear) are woven into resilience, forcing a trade-off: success requires her own dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: “her form growing lighter” as dawn arrives. Agency is total—Julian’s return is summoned by her artistry, not coincidence—and the price (her spectral existence) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden pathways for grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elara abandons technical control for somatic guidance. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses embodied intuition over empirical validation, narrowing her professional identity. Cost is felt: she relinquishes her skeptic’s armor, yet the resolution is earned through her agency, not the pill or geode alone. Coincidence (static shock) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmitting the earth’s memory to sleepers—is signaled early and deepens when the fossil floats, transforming Elara’s task from documentation to covenant. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her focused intent triggers the fossil’s glow and levitation. Cost is felt in the “sacred burden” of the map and the irreversible release of the artifact into the crevice. While pressure coheres, the absence of a tangible opposition or complicating force slightly limits the stakes’ visceral urgency, though this aligns with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming prophecy from fate to collective agency—is signaled early and deepens when the ceiling cracks, forcing Elara to act. Escalation is driven by her agency: cataloging buttons becomes active unscrambling, then public invitation. Cost is felt in the ledger’s weight and the implied vulnerability of sharing wisdom; however, the fracture’s resolution via suspended grain leans slightly toward convenient stasis rather than hard-won consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming self through vouchsafed truth—is signaled early and tightens when Anya appears, forcing Elias to choose between silence and exposure. His agency drives escalation: tracing the code, opening the pillbox, offering the flower. Cost is legible in the melting snow-code (ephemeral truth) and his trembling hands (enduring vulnerability). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Anya’s arrival complicates but the resolution stems from his prudently daring act, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—distilling a broken vow into actionable truth—is signaled early and deepens when memory reveals Elara’s death and failed relocation. The meaningful tightening occurs when ambient awareness reframes the promise not as location but as daily acts of care. Cost is felt in the erasure of original hope and the quiet burden of lullabies in dim rooms. Agency is internal but decisive: Silas chooses reinterpretation over despair, foreclosing return to Gloom Hill as redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding how kindness resists entropy—is signaled early and deepens when Kael witnesses the beekeeper’s acts as temporal stitches. Escalation is driven by his agency: aligning the glass with sun patterns, infusing touch with gentle intent. Cost is unmistakable—the thrum ceases, leaving silence and ash—but the story narrowly avoids a decisive physical trade-off; the price is emotional (carrying memory alone), slightly softening the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to overlooked beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s deliberate, fatiguing labor. The tightening occurs when Mateo’s gasp validates her act, transforming private ritual into shared solace. Cost is felt (shoulder fatigue, emotional exposure) and shapes the final image. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than protagonist-driven reversal; the pressure intensifies texturally, not causally, which aligns with the lens but lacks the agency-driven turn that would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—coexisting with inherited memory without being erased by it—is signaled early and deepens when the tide rises, forcing action. The tightening occurs at the stone circle: alignment must happen at zenith or fail. Agency drives escalation—Elara chooses to seek understanding, not flee. Cost is felt: emotional vulnerability, risk of shattering the fragile memory. The deepening reweights her entire stance, transforming isolation from wound to necessary space.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding “the thread that connects all things”—is signaled early and deepens when the thrush’s spiral offers tangible form. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she gathers, weaves, invites, transforming abstract longing into communal practice. Cost is felt in her solitude’s dissolution—a quiet loss of protective distance—and in the labor itself (hours kneeling, meticulous care). Coincidence (storm-dislodged nest) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to create.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal coherence against cosmic manipulation—is signaled early and deepens when Dean Croft’s memo escalates institutional opposition. Aris’s agency drives escalation: he chooses interference over compliance, risking everything. The meaningful tightening occurs at midnight, when alignment forces a now-or-never broadcast. Cost is felt (tears, Croft’s footsteps) but remains largely emotional; the story avoids showing tangible loss (e.g., destroyed equipment, arrest), which slightly limits the stakes’ visceral weight under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (end fallow period) is signaled early and tightens when retreat = condemning her village. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses melody over force, altering spatial chaos. Cost is felt (claustrophobic agony) and visible (dust-streaked tears). One tightening suffices, but the mutiny’s rules feel slightly convenient—why an organ?—softening causality just enough to dock 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy—is tested when Elara finds Clara chose freedom, forcing her to reframe “missing” as “whole.” The tightening occurs at the carving: revelation shifts her goal from solving a disappearance to honoring a choice. Cost is visible in her tears and lighter steps—empathy awakened within her first. Escalation is driven by her methodical probing, not external forces.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reversing Aris’s exile—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara decodes the coordinates, foreclosing archival obscurity for urgent action. The deepening occurs when the journal’s warning mirrors present conditions, transforming historical vindication into survival. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to press the nail reveals truth, which forces confrontation. Cost is unmistakable—the station’s annihilation—and the technician’s micro-tremor confirmation validates her insight without coincidence resolving the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming creative agency after decades of silence—is signaled early and tightens when the glass flake’s image glows, transforming memory into method. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: recounting the encounter aloud triggers the artifact’s luminosity, which in turn compels him to play. Cost is felt in his renunciation of mourning; the “ashes of ‘never’” become material. Coincidence (hitchhiker’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn comes from Elias’s choice to interpret and act on the secret mapped by flutters.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to build on domination or service—is signaled early and tightened when Leo equates venture capital with robbery. The meaningful deepening occurs in dialogue with Kai, narrowing options to a moral binary. Cost is felt: Leo sacrifices his father’s trophies; Kai abandons naive ambition. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the burden was never meant for one. Pressure escalates via her months-long correlation work, fatigue, and final locked door, then pivots on Kael’s telegram, which reframes the entire endeavor. The tightening forecloses her path of solitary scholarship, forcing renunciation of isolation. Cost is felt in her tears and healed spirit, and the visible price—months of fruitless solo labor—charges the final insight about shared vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (“discover what mirrors don’t show”) tightens decisively when Elara confronts her own frozen confession—cowardice reframed as the core wound. Agency drives escalation: her choice to unbend initiates expanding circles that narrow options (e.g., directing the plant’s hunger). Cost is felt in the confession’s emotional weight and physical release (“tears streamed freely”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each circle deepening knowledge and raising personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending the shattered covenant—is signaled early and deepens when the rift appears as a “silent, screaming” void. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but actively links through scars, each connection exacting physical cost. The tightening occurs at the birch knot and pine fire-mark, narrowing her path to the nexus. Final cost is conceptual yet undeniable: peace replaces anxiety only after pouring “every linked scar” into the tear.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—mending a bartered destiny—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s escalating vulnerability: from placing objects to offering his own reckless hope as soil for her peace. The tightening occurs when the wisp of sorrow coalesces, forcing him to choose truth over force. His agency drives the escalation: each recounted memory weaves the trammel, culminating in the voluntary absorption of anguish. Cost is unmistakable: his chest fills with cold sorrow, body heavy yet spirit lighter—a precise, felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after loss—is signaled early and deepens when Leo realizes his appraisal career was just “a quieter form of validation.” The tightening occurs when the ritual of facts fails, forcing him to confront emotion, which narrows his options: continue chasing approval or honor hidden labor. His decision forecloses the auction-house path with visible cost (loss of status, income certainty). Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition physics—is signaled early and deepens when the spirit’s “clean escape defied all instruments,” forcing Aris to choose between despair and analogical thinking. His agency drives escalation: translating cuneiform → planting the seed → redefining his life’s work. The cost is palpable: thirty years of chasing phantoms now redirected into compassionate guidance, foreclosing the path of lonely control. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens—each textual echo (“seed on the wind”) reweights his options until the final act feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against mechanical oblivion—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s smelting choices, which narrow options by demanding acceptance of contradiction. Agency is clear: she actively fuses shards, altering their fate. Cost is felt in the “sharp” longing of unresolved fragments and her tear of effort. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through textual density rather than external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—dissolving emotional fortresses—is signaled early and deepens through the shell’s etched confessions, each narrowing Elias’s options by mirroring his own regrets. His agency peaks in the deliberate placement of the pearl, a renunciation that forecloses solitary burden-bearing with visible cost (the pearl’s departure). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the “method” arrives as revelation rather than hard-won discovery, slightly softening the escalation’s causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—achieving self-forgiveness through confronting neglect—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reads the graffiti, which reframes her life’s work. The tightening occurs when she chooses to play the accordion despite its imperfect repair, foreclosing the path of archival detachment (symbolized by folding the map away). Agency is clear: her breath initiates the note; her decision to leave the paper map transforms her methodology. Cost is felt in the tear of release and the visible relinquishment of control over documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—giving form to unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the library processes silence through delay. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from documenting others’ words to writing her own apology, foreclosing passive observation. Pressure escalates via the approaching dawn/letter, but the reversal mechanic (cyclically reversed text) doesn’t generate new complications—it reiterates. Still, cost is felt: peace is fragile, voice is hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—weighing dream against empire—is signaled early and tightens via the violin’s fading luminescence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she reads coffee stains, recalls the mulberry’s song, and chooses to play. The meaningful deepening occurs when the coffee map reveals two futures, forcing a trade-off with visible cost—the violin’s destruction for the seed’s life. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing Kael’s spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens at the “threshold of stillness,” where failure means erasure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her watchful awareness, pattern-finding, and memory-weaving are active choices that narrow the window to a single, decisive moment. The cost is felt in the tear, the vial’s weight, and the irreversible passage of the threshold. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the aurora’s response is consequence, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment through release—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses to carve not for the offender but for herself. The deepening occurs mid-ascent: she decides to shed resentment as self-care, foreclosing the path of lingering bitterness. Cost is visible in the labor of carving and the emotional weight of letting go. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each tap of the chisel narrowing the space for old wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s suffocating certainty—is signaled early and deepened when Elara reframes the wreck (“three vessels you saved”). The tightening occurs when he confronts the shard’s lie, leading to the unhooking. Cost is felt in the trembling hands and released weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the wind’s role borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing to appear—is signaled early and deepens when Aris recognizes his work is about love’s resilience, not time’s physics. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to withhold Elara’s memory compassionately, narrowing his path to pedagogical patience. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his stone-throw initiates the trance, his focus interprets the rings, his decision crystallizes the lesson. Cost is felt in the “frantic impulse to grasp” he must suppress and the solitude of guarding truth.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—mapping the canyon’s true geography through resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the flock fractures, revealing the Pulse’s bifurcation. Corbin’s agency drives escalation: his humming integrates the harmonics, transforming passive observation into active bridging. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices mobility to become a living compass, his brittle body now fused with the archive. The Accumulative lens tightens pressure through increasing density of resonant patterns, culminating in a single, steady rhythm synced to his breath.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving sacred simplicity against automation—is signaled early and tightens when retrieval becomes pilgrimage. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to “unstrap” rather than seize transforms the spire’s physics, proving stakes are visceral, not abstract. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits guild standing to witness truth, and the final image shows her isolation amid hollow spells. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each layer of neglect she releases deepens the luminance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound as proof of love’s resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the log confirms luminous vows exist. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, to open the chest, to read, to weep, to leave the key. The cost is felt: confronting buried sorrow, relinquishing a talisman, accepting that Elara’s light lives only in memory. Pressure tightens via the lantern release clock and the sea’s encroaching silence, forcing his emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a dead universe—is signaled by line 2 and tightens when static bursts amplify doubt. Elara’s agency lies in attention, not alteration; her “distilling” action narrows options to one: embrace witnesshood. Cost is conceptual (foregoing futurity) but viscerally felt in “heavy frost” doubt softening to peace. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—naming fears to honor Elara’s sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens with each crystallization, narrowing Kael’s emotional options until only the Void remains. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: his choices to channel specific regrets and loves into light beams raise the emotional cost visibly. The tightening culminates in the ultimate trade-off: transforming his deepest sorrow into a diamond that memorializes loss but cannot restore presence. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending cosmic imbalance through the bell—is signaled early and deepens via the “seventy-three dawns” of observation, narrowing options to patience over power. Agency resides in attention, not force, and the cost is felt in Elara’s fatigue and social ridicule. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her precise drip timing catalyzes molecular repair, culminating in the bell’s chime. One tightening suffices—a single silver fish confirms stakes are viscerally real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the reservoir authority’s directive to “expunge.” Her agency lies in renunciation: she refuses bureaucratic sanitization, choosing instead to “rescue” the bottle, thereby foreclosing compliance and accepting the burden of custodianship. The cost is felt in the “sharp pang of grief” and the weight of the bottle as “anchor,” which reconfigures her role from warden to weaver of communal identity. Escalation is driven by her precise, intentional action under pressure, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightened when the grimoire demands flame yet intuition recoils. The starlings’ dance forces a deepening that narrows options: she must abandon command for guidance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the flock’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elara interprets and acts. Cost is felt: the risk of irreversible fracture if her new method fails, made visceral in her held breath and tears.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through accurate celestial pattern-reading—is signaled early and tightens when the Serpent constellation fractures. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for command but invents a corrective lens using the arbor itself. Cost is felt (past trauma resurfaces) and conceptual (trust requires courage to revise). However, external pressure remains minimal—Commander Vance’s voice is warm relief, not opposition—so stakes rely heavily on internalized duty, slightly limiting dramatic friction under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness through authentic connection—is signaled early and deepens via Kaela’s embrace of void as canvas. The single meaningful tightening occurs when she rejects legal pretense for vivification, narrowing options from custody battle to creation. Agency is clear: her choice to harmonize opposites drives escalation, with cost (abandoning court victory) unmistakable in the final lines. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with history’s flux contrasting the dojo’s essential stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for slow innovation—is signaled early and deepens when the corpse flower validates Elias’s rejected “Patient Bloom” concept. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to plant the seed privately, renouncing public validation (investor approval, marked success). Cost is felt: he foregoes immediate recognition, embracing years of uncertainty. Agency drives escalation—his orthogonal thinking leads to insight, then action—but the conflict remains internal, lacking external pressure that would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter through sound—is signaled early and deepens when the echo chamber briefly returns Clara’s laugh, raising the emotional cost of failure. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to sing, angle the nozzle, and throttle down. The tightening occurs when wind and memory achieve “impossible harmony,” narrowing his world to that fragile moment. Cost is felt in his tears and the parents’ off-stage grief, though secondary characters remain just beyond the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—choosing uncertainty over certainty—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the rift: crossing would “reject the deep friendship forged with this place.” Agency drives escalation; the guardian’s interiorizing practice enables its refusal. Cost is visceral (“clawed hand tightening... magnetic desperation”) and conceptual (abandoning purpose). The “boundaries of light” motif deepens stakes by framing the rift as both temptation and test of its vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interrupting stifling destiny through creation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara rejects repair for vivification. Pressure escalates via successive approximation failures, each narrowing options until creative destruction becomes the only viable path. The cost is felt: physical exhaustion (frost on lashes), emotional risk (despair before surrender), and social defiance (rejecting the bishop’s words). Agency drives every turn; luck never resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding genesis within endings—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s discarding of assumptions, which narrows her interpretive options until only silence remains. Agency is exercised through attention and renunciation, not action; each discarded belief forecloses a path with emotional cost. The serenely electric atmosphere intensifies pressure without resolving it mechanically. Though escalation is subtle, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—merging fractured timelines to ensure passenger safety—is signaled early and tightens when Leo realizes passengers are “trapped in a bubble of mundane perception.” Escalation is driven by his agency: interpreting the starlight map, humming the shanty, turning the hourglass. The cost is felt: he alone bears the memory of the rift, a solitude that deepens his spirit but isolates him. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—a crescendo of sensory anomalies culminating in decisive action—but the lack of a foreclosed option (e.g., sacrificing his normalcy) slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when the weave erupts, forcing Elara to confront the cost of control. Escalation is driven by her agency: she attempts to reinforce the rational structure, but the threads’ autonomy triggers the rupture. The visible price—scattered threads, altered memories, emotional catharsis—charges the final image under an Accumulative lens, though the transition from tension to eruption lacks one intermediate tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming celestial navigation—is signaled early and deepens via the chain link’s geometric revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Lyra closes her eyes and projects the edge into starlight, narrowing options from doubt to embodied certainty. Agency is intellectual yet visceral: perception itself becomes action. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the surrender of ocean-bound identity for cosmic belonging—and felt in Kael’s “soaring hope” amid “somber marvel.”

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices from erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Lily’s near-invisibility raises urgency. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her focus deepens the pulse into words, forcing the choice to deliver truth without overwhelming the child. Cost is felt in the social worker’s presence (institutional fragility) and Elara’s immediate return to solitude, underscoring that heroism extracts emotional labor. Coincidence (Lily’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the lifeline was already crafted; Elara merely activates it.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—standing by the unremembered—is signaled early and deepens when the cables’ whisper manifests as blue script. Pressure escalates via tidal countdown and spatial constriction, forcing focus on the gold fleck. Aris’s agency drives the climax: aligning the codex, turning the valve. Cost is felt in abandonment (leaving the journal) and physical peril (fleeing surge). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; everything stems from his choices and inherited tools.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming existence from systemic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the error was human, not malicious, shifting her goal from correction to prevention. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for bureaucracy but performs defragmentation via ink ritual. Cost is felt: three hundred forty heartbeats mark endurance, and her tears freeze—a physical toll of emotional release. The tightening forecloses passive victimhood, replacing it with deliberate advocacy.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Old Tongue through translation—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: Elara correlates bird flight to diamond flaws over sixty dawns, then actively harnesses the aerial script. Escalation is textural: each flock movement (V-dive, river-flow, starburst) forces a corresponding vocalization, narrowing options until the final word crystallizes all textures. Cost is unmistakable: the weight of centuries lifts only after she risks failure in the tunnel. No coincidence resolves tension; birds mirror but don’t dictate—their patterns are tools Elara wields.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—turning bitterness into understanding—is signaled early and deepens via Aris’s shift from observer to protector. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to witness, then to stay silent, forecloses her academic path. The “gravitationally playful” dewdrop pirouette crystallizes the thematic cost—wonder demands surrender, not capture. Pressure tightens once (static → metamorphosis → dissolution), sufficient for this length, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty against mechanical control—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the monolith. Elara’s agency drives escalation: technical failure → heart-rhythm method → physical uprooting. Cost is unmistakable (“fingers tearing,” “fractured statues”) and alters tactics. Coincidence never resolves; even the bee’s buzz stems from her melody’s vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fostering connection across a divided border—is signaled early and tightens when the patrol drone appears, forcing Kael to deploy the storm bottle at personal risk. His agency drives escalation: uncorking the storm is a costly choice that narrows options (exposure vs. mission). The price is visible in his “mask of neutrality” afterward—a performance shielding revolution. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from his preparation and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether silence can be transformed into song—is signaled early and deepened when Elara confronts the halo fragment. Her decision to sing forecloses the path of mute endurance, with visible cost in her trembling frame. Pressure escalates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens, though the landslide’s role borders on convenient complication. The stakes remain viscerally felt through bodily and acoustic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s method. The escalation occurs when memory and geometry converge, transforming abstract search into embodied revelation. Agency is internal but active: her focused attention triggers the reawakening. Cost is subtle but present: she relinquishes the need for a physical archive, accepting impermanence. No external antagonist, but pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens—each descriptive beat tightens thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the dream’s emotional truth—is signaled early and deepens via the unusual clarity of the archipelago’s whispers, which narrow her focus to this one sunrise. Agency lies in her precise blend and shutter press; luck complicates (the wind’s shift), but resolution stems from her ritualized attention. Cost is felt: a decade of solitude crystallizes into one photograph that redefines “home.” Escalation is subtle but decisive—a single cadence shift from yearning to recognition under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberating a love-idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and deepens when the lock is revealed as woven from regret. The locksmith’s agency drives escalation: he disorients fear not with force but tenderness, a credible reversal under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the quiet sacrifice of closure without recognition. However, the “enveloped secrets” remain abstract; their dissolution lacks concrete tactical consequence beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memory—is signaled early and deepens when the method reveals it was a protective erasure. The tightening occurs when Aris aligns the stars and the moon, triggering the return of truth; this is driven by his agency (sketching, observing), not coincidence. Cost is legible: decades of avoidance, emotional burden, and the irreversible knowledge of Elara’s sacrifice. However, the escalation lacks a tangible trade-off beyond time and emotional labor, slightly softening the pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile through active geometry—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara’s chaotic leaves give way to her deliberate annotation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael reframes annotation as cartography, narrowing options from passive grief to pattern analysis. Cost is unmistakable: Elara’s trembling hand, Kael’s suppressed retreat, the “raw ache” of absence. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the “creeping gray of indifference.” Her agency is clear: she gathers and weaves essences, channeling them into the seed. The cost is conceptual (a lifetime of resistance) and visible in the tear and hardened resolve. While pressure accumulates beautifully, the escalation lacks a concrete narrowing of options—she succeeds without measurable sacrifice beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits through truth-exhumation—is signaled early and deepens as each knot reveals layered grief (terror, longing, sacrifice). Elara’s agency drives escalation: her needle-work forces memory-blooms that narrow options until only the final knot remains. The cost is legible in her tears and the lucid unrest settling into understanding—peace is earned through witnessed sorrow, not granted. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density (more knots, thicker silence), culminating in a wave of pure peace that dissolves spirits.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reopening dialogue between known and unknown—is signaled early via the map’s tear. Escalation occurs through Elara’s agency: she chooses split-screen playback, notes geological shift, overlays data. The deepening (shadow misalignment) narrows options: truth lies not in stone alone but in calibrated earth-sky geometry. Cost is visible in her solitude, months of restoration, and ultimate restraint—she publishes not proof but invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—tightens when Aris chooses to splice the tape despite emotional risk, narrowing options from retrieval to reckoning. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: untangling threads (literal/corrosive, narrative/emotional) forces confrontation with Elara’s whisper. Cost is felt—the stone in his chest—but the deepening lacks a second tangible forfeiture (e.g., time, oxygen), slightly softening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unspoken—is signaled early and deepens through symbolic accumulation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara carves the final symbol (circle divided into four), completing the “ghost in code” just before thunder arrives; this forecloses further action and crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt: the work is ephemeral on the surface yet permanent in essence, and she accepts invisibility as necessary. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each groove adds emotional weight, culminating in a resonant release.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is signaled early and deepens as each diary entry reveals love persisting beyond loss. Pressure escalates texturally: Floor 3 (initial shimmer), Floor 5 (sweet memories), Floor 7 (final crystalline truth). Kael’s agency lies in attention and interpretation, not action, yet his choice to wear the goggles and linger on the text constitutes meaningful engagement. The cost is conceptual: he must carry this hard-won insight forward, altering his perception permanently. While stakes remain internal, they are viscerally rendered and never abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving memory persists in absence—is signaled early and deepens through Aris’s cloud categorizations, each narrowing emotional options until the fallstreak hole forces acceptance. Agency is sustained: every log entry is a deliberate act of memorializing that forecloses despair. The tightening is textural (not causal): grief → comfort → hope → peace, culminating in the void’s revelation. Cost is felt in the journal’s nearing end and the “dam of two years breaking”—a price paid in solitude now transformed into proof.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving crafted beauty against impermanence—is signaled early and deepens when the coin reveals that infinity resides in bounded detail, not vast canvases. The tightening occurs when Elara shifts from resisting limits to embracing them, altering her tactics (she stops trying to save the murals). Agency is clear: her tactile exploration drives the revelation, and the cost—abandoning twenty years of work—is felt in the “deafening crack” of demolition. Pressure escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens, with the ticking clock sharpening urgency without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reigniting the ship’s heart—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s cross-referencing work. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she interprets shadows, retrieves the phrasebook, deciphers glyphs. The starling murmuration complicates but doesn’t resolve; her insight drives the turn. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and emotional vulnerability, though slightly understated compared to the physical stakes of drift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and deepened when the prophecy reveals it’s not about force but “listening.” The tightening occurs at the core: uncap the light to see wear patterns, not just breakage. Agency is total: Elara chooses the lullaby rhythm, selects the polished gear, whispers it home. Cost is felt: the irreversible loss of her mentor’s hands, transmuted into her own competence. Coincidence never resolves; every advance stems from her choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving the orchard that embodies their hard-won unity—is signaled early and tightens when the blight threatens both livelihood and symbolic sanctuary. The “reexamine” command forces a meaningful deepening: shifting from mechanical repair to cosmic ritual. Agency drives escalation (salvaging mirrors, positioning bell), and the cost—Elara’s departure—is felt in the final lines. Coincidence complicates (blight appears mysteriously) but never resolves; solution arises from collective effort guided by earned trust.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the lullaby across all time—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s method: channeling it via nested patterns into structured light. The escalation is driven by her agency: she aligns frequencies, activates the pane, and wills memory into the mechanism. Cost is unmistakable: her heartbeat ceases, reality folds, and she collapses in exhaustion. The tightening occurs when sound is swallowed—no fallback, only silent transmission. Coincidence never resolves; every step is earned under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers before frost—is signaled early and tightens as twilight bleeds into violet. Elara’s agency drives escalation: three days of searching, precise assembly, exact rotation of the nut. The cost is felt in her thinning hope and physical precision under pressure. Frost’s arrival raises stakes concretely, and the family’s terror makes the danger visceral. Luck (spotting the nut) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution requires her skill and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—atonement through ethical integration—is signaled early and deepens when Aris observes the streams’ confluence, transforming abstract regret into actionable intent. The tightening occurs in his micro-choice to draft a proposal crediting Elara, foreclosing solitary ambition. Cost is felt: two years of isolation, the irreversible loss of shared metamorphosis. Escalation is driven by perception, not coincidence, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—facing the void to initiate creation—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s quantification ritual. The lull isn’t passive; it’s dense with unmet expectation, escalating pressure until she acts. Her incision forecloses infinite potential into singular form, a tangible cost. The arrival of the first customer confirms the stake’s validity, proving the parole’s power—but the escalation hinges on protagonist agency alone, with no external opposition to test resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—refining stored remorse before it poisons the fortress—is signaled early and tightens when Aris locates the pavilion. The meaningful deepening occurs at the climax: he must surrender to contagion to alchemize pain, narrowing options to total absorption or failure. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, phantom grief, and permanent internal burden (“carried the smoothed remorse within”). Agency drives escalation—his choice to press his palm initiates the irreversible transfer—and the emotional price alters his being, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s requirement for reweighted stakes through density and cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal voice—is signaled early and deepens when Elara diagnoses the cause not as mechanical failure but disconnection. The tightening occurs when she chooses not force but linguistic empathy, narrowing options to her unique methodology. Cost is visible: physical exhaustion, emotional vulnerability (“tears tracing warm paths”), and the implicit burden of being the sole bridge-builder. However, the antagonist (a detached clock weight) is too minor to generate meaningful opposition, softening pressure despite elegant escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transitioning from builder to archeologist of dreams—is signaled early and deepens through each memory surfacing, narrowing her identity to vesselhood. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to “modify her own perceptual filters,” accepting vulnerability as method. Cost is felt: trembling body, abandoned career, emotional overload. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Slight deduction because the “opposition” remains abstract (chaos vs. order) rather than dramatized external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and tightened by celestial timing, past failure, and physical laws. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: decoding doodles, risking inversion, tracing luminous paths. Cost is unmistakable: decades of isolation, near-miss trauma, and the burden of sole custodianship. The sixty-minute window forces trade-offs (precision over haste), and the final turn—choosing to plant new seeds—forecloses passive preservation forever.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silenced histories—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses empathy over intrusion (“not to shatter the quiet”). The single meaningful tightening occurs when she selects the insulator to “ask the wood to speak,” narrowing her method to collaborative listening. Cost is felt: her tears trace “silent paths,” and the hedgehog’s pause underscores the fragility of this communion. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the conflict lacks external opposition, relying solely on internal/resonant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving chess as pure intellect—is signaled early and tightens when the prince demands deceitful gambits. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his refusal (past) and present correlation of silence force a trade-off between court safety and integrity. Cost is unmistakable: exile, lost students, silenced library. The deepening—realizing fracture enables grace—narrows options to principled solitude, paid for in visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering a specific silence to heal decades of regret—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritual, which narrows options to a single frequency only compassion can hear. The escalation is driven by her agency: each dial turn is a choice that risks emotional inundation, culminating in the resonator’s lock and the clasp’s thaw. The cost is unmistakable: she absorbs Mr. Henderson’s grief so fully she becomes him momentarily, bearing the “sharp sting of harsh words” and “crushing loneliness.” This emotional price directly shapes her final decision to offer silent presence, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tested by the corpse flower’s anticipated stench. Pressure escalates through daily ritual and sensory strain, narrowing options to endurance or abandonment. The cost is felt (trembling hope, steady hands) and legible in the final image. Slight deduction: the “challenge” of the bloom remains prospective, not fully enacted, softening the immediate pressure at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving western groves—is signaled early and deepens into protecting memory itself. Pressure tightens via time (waning inversion hour) and knowledge (arrow tip’s true function as listener’s guide, not controller). Agency shifts from seeking to witnessing; the cost is relinquishing control. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—Kael’s attention and reverence earn the insight, though escalation leans slightly more on revelation than active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing recurrence through systemic change—is signaled early and tightens when Kael finds Croft’s identical patch, making the abstract personal. His agency drives escalation: real-time sensor adjustments, hypothesis revisions, and final recommendations are all tactical responses to discovered pressure points. Cost is unmistakable: the patch embodies a life lost to terrestrial arrogance, and Kael’s resolve carries the weight of that blood price. Coincidence never resolves; causality flows from wind physics to human error to institutional remedy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving awe essential—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must interpret aurora in real time, narrowing options to precise chromatic choices. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each bell strike responds to shifting lights, releasing deeper layers of “frozen memory.” Cost is felt physically (frozen tears, weary body) and conceptually (the risk that wonder might remain imprisoned). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density rather than external opposition, which fits the story’s contemplative design.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming failure into wisdom—is signaled early and deepened through Kael’s ritual acts. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: arranging markers builds humility, playing flute forces confrontation with past self. Cost is unmistakable: he must relive his catastrophic deafness to land’s warnings, tears tracing “paths through canyon dust.” Though no external antagonist exists, internal conflict tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each note stitches “regret into resolve” until silence becomes “comforting embrace.”

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens when the philosopher’s sorrow collides with the poet’s joy, forcing Elara to choose between disintegration or integration. The escalation is driven by her agency: she deliberately sets ambiguous type, clutches the fragment, and seeks constants, all while the external pressure of the final star vanishing tightens options. The cost is visceral: identity fraying into cacophony before reconfiguring into harmony. Under the Accumulative lens, this single intensification reweights the entire premise with emotional and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindling wonder in the face of loss—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant activates, forcing Kael to choose between passive grief and active resonance. The germination act forecloses the path of mere courier duty; he now carries living wonder. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he doesn’t summon the memory—it finds him, but he *kneels*, *listens*, and *allows* the vibration. Cost is visible: the routine is gone, replaced by lifelong responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating his theory of emotional absorption—is signaled early and deepens when the frost contradicts his interpretation, forcing a costly recalibration. Escalation is driven by Kael’s own method: his deliberate communion narrows options until evidence refutes him, and the breeze’s timing complicates but doesn’t resolve—it merely reveals what was already there. The price is conceptual and emotional: his “truthful lie” dissolves, foreclosing his prior path of certainty. Agency remains intact; his humility is a chosen stance, not passive surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sending a message across decades—is signaled early and tightens when raveling silence accelerates, forcing Elara to weave her present tether into the threads. Agency drives escalation: discovering puzzle edges teaches border-first weaving, which enables the frame that contains chaos. Cost is unmistakable: “with each memory woven… a thread of her current reality dissolved.” The deepening isn’t just thematic—it physically erodes her world, narrowing options until only full self-sacrifice remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s sacrifice and descent. The tightening occurs when he chooses the mine shaft over surface despair, narrowing options to a single, costly ritual. Agency is clear: his pouring of spirit into the silk drives the climax, not coincidence. Cost is visible (lost memory) and conceptual (resilience requires surrender), though the external opposition is environmental rather than interpersonal, which slightly limits pressure variance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering the truth of Kael’s final act—tightens when the weave turns volatile, forcing Elara to choose between pursuit and compassion. This deepening is driven by her agency: redirecting intent harmonizes chaos, revealing Kael’s sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable: she integrates the truth’s weight, transforming her purpose. The “cyclically spontaneous” attribute imposes real pressure—it flares unpredictably, threatening ejection—and the timeframe (“murmur of half-remembered dreams”) narrows her window for action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the anonymous letter chain as sanctuary—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp fails. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for dawn but actively rebuilds the message, foreclosing passivity with visible cost (emotional labor, physical kneeling in damp). The tightening occurs in the stacking ritual, which narrows options to one precise configuration. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through textual density, not causality, yet the cost remains visceral and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—steering chaos toward grace—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s accidental laugh summons the storm, forcing him to wield his art under pressure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his precise tilts of the wick transform fury into form. Cost is unmistakable: physical strain, emotional solitude, and the burden of unacknowledged labor. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and symbolic density, not external opposition, yet remains coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why Kaela magnetized stories—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s ritual, culminating in renunciation of collection for creation. The escalation is driven by her agency: choosing method, timing, and interpretation. Cost is felt in the tear-streaked awe and the permanent shift in craft philosophy. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via light’s slow creep, not external opposition, which fits the introspective design.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing trees’ wisdom through the sextant—is signaled early and deepens via the method’s fragility. The tightening occurs when the storm subsides and silence creates the precise condition for the pin’s fall to coincide with moonlight, narrowing the window for success. Agency is clear: Elara’s three-season labor enables the climax; luck (cloud gap) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the pin’s fall is her embodied presence, not coincidence. Cost is felt: her solitude transforms into connection, but only after sustained, lonely work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating vocal commitment: first a hum, then layered chants, finally a chorus joined by distant villages. The tightening is decisive: silence risks eternal night; song demands vulnerability and memory. Cost is unmistakable—“a century of vigil,” the weight of keeper’s medallion, the child’s hand slipping—and visibly alters tactics (she must sing forgotten songs despite fragmentation). Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming belonging through confronting past error—is signaled early and deepens via the solstice gathering’s off-stage revelation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: choosing ritual over flight, projecting awareness despite risk. The tightening forecloses descent (physical attendance), forcing spiritual presence with cost (loneliness endured). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the elder’s speech emerges from established society values, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens when Madame Lin produces the resurrected loaf, forcing Elara to shift from memory-anchor to resilience-compass. The tightening occurs in her kneeling labor: uncloaking soil becomes a renunciation of passive grief. Cost is felt in the tear and the vulnerability of planting seeds in winter’s shadow. Agency drives escalation; coincidence merely complicates (lost bakery), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—salvaging meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s frequency sampling. The tightening occurs when the illusion flickers violently, granting one last glimpse before vanishing: this narrows her window to act, forcing immediate, precise recording. The cost is legible: the vow’s sensory richness (rain-scented garden, whispered “always”) is lost forever, replaced by data. Though pressure is internal and procedural, it coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each amplitude drop raising emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the truce while documenting its fragility—is signaled by line 82 and tightens decisively at midnight when Elara plants the rumor, consuming Silas’s focus. Protagonist agency drives all escalation: her three false starts are tactical, costly (time, risk of exposure), and narrow Silas’s path to public accusation. The climax’s moral calculus—exposing forgery over permitting violence—carries conceptual cost: trust must be mended consciously, not assumed. Sunrise deadline creates relentless cadence shift from unease to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—validating whether emotional weather is real—tightens when the ring activates and culminates in the forest’s election of “compassion,” directly testing Elara’s belief. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to trust the ring, steps forward despite doubt, and interprets sensory data. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: relinquishing skepticism as intellectual armor. Coincidence (the raindrop on her wrist) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough comes from her willingness to perceive, fulfilling the Situational lens’s pressure-to-stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rectifying silence through art—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara chooses to sketch despite exile, guided by flawless recall. The tightening occurs when she aligns the broken lock with the revealed numerals, foreclosing her path of suppression. Cost is unmistakable: tears of release, the weight of the new charcoal as covenant, and the irreversible commitment to “draw me in the light.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each brushstroke intensifying crystal luminescence until the compartment opens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—is signaled early and deepens through encounters that narrow Elara’s path from relic-hunting to human witness. Each confession (child, elder, neighbor) tightens pressure, forcing her to choose between archival solitude and communal vulnerability. The zinc fragment’s warmth rewards honesty, making candor tactical. Final cost: she relinquishes the myth of a stored archive for the labor of receiving fleeting truths—a trade-off earned by her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving cerulean wonder against collective gray—is signaled early and tightens as the solstice sun forces a single, irreversible performance. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her push initiates the symphony, and the iceberg’s glisten narrows options to this one moment. Cost is felt in the fragment’s exhaustion, though no secondary loss (time, stamina) alters tactics. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with coincidence (wind, sun angle) complicating but not resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving Lena’s memory without being shattered by it—is signaled early and deepens when magnetic shift fractures archives. Unit Seven’s agency drives escalation: it chooses controlled burn over passive storage, narrowing options to one precise, high-stakes act. Cost is felt: irreplaceable artifacts are consumed, yet this loss enables peace. The “controlled burn escape” method isn’t coincidence—it’s a self-devised tactic shaped by the android’s botanical knowledge and emotional need, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring Clara’s promise before the mailbox is destroyed—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the noon deadline arrives. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she synthesizes fragmented stories into action, choosing trust over haste. The cost is unmistakable—sixty years of silence nearly erased, Mr. Henderson’s buried guilt, the risk of losing Clara’s legacy—and crystallizes in the city official’s emotional reversal. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming encoded despair into rescue—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s frustration and dance. The tightening occurs when “LISTEN” appears on the dice, forcing her to reinterpret ambient noise as signal. Agency is clear: she chooses to wait, to move, to turn with tidal precision. Cost is felt in her physical isolation and emotional exposure, yet luck never resolves—only her attunement to the lab’s rhythms does. Coincidence (the chime) complicates but doesn’t solve; her interpretation makes it actionable.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased memory—is signaled early and tightens at the geode, where gravity swirls like a “silent storm,” raising physical and emotional risk. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets coffee grounds, climbs cliffs, and chooses to pour longing into salt. The cost—decades of haunted absence—is felt in her tears and the chamber’s sigh of equilibrium. Coincidence never resolves; the whale’s arrival is a catalyst, not a solution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing a corrosive prophecy—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s deepening awareness of its manipulative core. The tightening occurs when she identifies the lie (“a manipulation designed to sever land and sky”), which narrows her tactic to a single, precise act: exhaling the smoothed hush. Cost is legible in the wing’s dissolution, a tangible loss of her mentor’s artifact. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the building’s truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she’s been “interrogating the wrong question.” The tightening occurs when Mrs. Davison reveals the cornerstone lie, foreclosing Elara’s fact-chasing path. Cost is visible in her abandoned archival approach. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure curve is subtle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear from the outset: transform quarantined grief into self-sustaining independence. The tightening occurs when the seashell’s whispers breach her mental quarantine, forcing her to engage the very method she once dismissed. Agency drives escalation—Elara initiates the archive, guides chaotic energy, and chooses burial over retention. Cost is unmistakable: she releases the memory’s haunting cycle, accepting that its beauty lies in its irretrievability. The dawn threshold isn’t coincidence but a live clock shaping her final act.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiving the unfinished—is signaled early and tightens when Kael inserts the key, ceasing the drip: a decisive narrowing of possibility. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to enact the ritual, not wait for absolution. The cost is felt in lost decades, Elian’s death, and the irreversible weight of treason. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory and temporal density, not external opposition, which is valid and masterfully executed.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped echoes—is signaled early and deepens through each shell disclosure, narrowing Elara’s path to the solstice stone. Agency lies in her choice to sing, transforming shame into truth. Cost is visible: tears, emotional burden, and irreversible commitment to future listening. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative pressure, though the web’s mechanics lean slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering Clara’s love across time—is signaled early and deepens when Lena’s dream reveals the cameo. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to dive into Lena’s subconscious, then to write the letter framing truth as gift. Cost is visible in her isolation and emotional burden, though the “tightening” is subtle—a single meaningful deepening rather than narrowed options. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices, but lacks a second pressure point to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through the fireflies’ response to the whistle, which transforms observation into participation. The tightening occurs when the fireflies reorganize into a helix, proving patterns are responsive to humble human acknowledgment. While the escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency (the whistle), the cost remains abstract—no tangible loss or sacrifice alters tactics. Still, the conceptual price of transience and the emotional weight of legacy lend sufficient pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. preservation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes debunking would destroy the sanctuary. Her agency drives escalation: reassembling letters, interpreting Thorne’s intent, choosing silence. The tightening forecloses her former path with palpable cost: she becomes a sentinel, bearing solitude. Pressure remains coherent under the Hybrid lens, culminating in a morally complex renunciation that reweights all prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding a fractured world through overlooked wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when the ionosphere clears, raising the cost of failure: if the message isn’t heard, hope remains buried. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her deliberate fragmentation forces listeners to co-create meaning, and the solstice revelation narrows options to a single hour and stone. The cost is legible in her exhaustion and decades of solitude, though the physical act of pressing the moss-stone is delegated to Hemlock, slightly softening protagonist ownership of the climax. Still, the stakes transform from abstract yearning to tangible seed vaults, irrigating both land and doctrine.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancestral memory against “the roar of progress”—is signaled early and deepens when the music box personalizes the mission. The tightening occurs when recognition of his grandmother’s lullaby transforms abstract duty into intimate repair, narrowing options to one: capture this melody for Elara. Agency is clear (winding, positioning, sealing), and cost is felt—decades of silence yield only to deliberate, fragile effort. Yet escalation relies more on emotional resonance than rising external pressure; the “storm” that unearthed the box is off-stage, slightly weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting the Aethelburg Chime from spirit-born tremors—is signaled early and tightens when the stabilizer fails, forcing abandonment of logic for forgotten method. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each refined strike is a choice that narrows options (only perfect harmonic will work). Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, emotional agony, and the risk of permanent dissonance. The “forgiveness woven from sound” reframes conflict as reconciliation, not combat, deepening stakes thematically and mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unyoking her people from tyranny of haste—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s internal pressure (“impulse hummed like a trapped bird”) and external conditions (viaduct’s rare post-rain state). The meaningful tightening occurs at climax: alignment demands surrender, not force, narrowing options to one fragile act. Cost is felt in decades of waiting crystallized into this moment. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s agency under Accumulative lens—her tracking, breathing, pressing palm—all shaping the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing the society’s lethal control—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern’s placement proves deliberate, not accidental. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her empirical method uncovers scuff marks, then her own memory confirms coercion. The cost is legible: carrying the lantern means re-engaging trauma, yet she chooses it. One meaningful deepening suffices—the shift from observer to avenger—but the societal opposition remains off-stage, slightly softening external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether broken things (and men) deserve repair—is signaled early and deepens when Horvath rejects “deserve” for “possibility.” Tightening occurs at the hairline fracture reveal, which narrows options from “scrap” to “waiting.” Cost is felt in Elias’s tears and renewed purpose. Agency is sustained: Elias chooses to carry the lesson back into the penitentiary.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating ephemeral vision into tangible flight—is signaled early and deepens when the kaleidoscope reveals the unbroken circle. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to feed perfection into the Algorithm, risking failure. Cost is felt in her tears and the irreversible reconfiguration of the glider. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. corporate erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Lena’s video reveals the crash was staged. Elara’s lie to Vance is a decisive tightening that forecloses compliance and incurs moral cost. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (inputting numbers, accessing Psi), not coincidence. The final image crystallizes stakes: silence as sacred protection, not absence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the orchard through empathetic reconstitution—is signaled early and deepens via three mirror glimpses that narrow options to synthesis. Pressure escalates texturally: silence replaces groaning ice, wind stills, creating a “weighted breath” that forces the peacekeeper’s decisive act. Agency is clear: they choose to kneel, press the shard, and channel memory—not magic. Cost is legible: the courage to endure fracture rather than flee, crystallized in their shadow now laced with green and gold.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara delays her appointment to mend nets, transforming passive seeking into active listening. The tightening occurs when the journal surfaces, forcing confrontation between her private quest and communal memory. Cost is felt: she relinquishes the sterile clarity of planned death for the messy warmth of shared stories. Luck (finding the journal) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Lars’ grief shadows make the stakes human, not mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling mismatched love—is signaled early via Clara’s tears and Liam’s crossed arms. Pressure escalates through Elara’s parallel-drawing, which forces micro-choices: Clara recalling vigil, Liam softening posture. The deepening occurs when the graft metaphor reframes friction as generative, narrowing options to patience or departure. Cost is felt: pride burned, criticism armored, silence misread. However, escalation leans slightly on exposition (“This is my purpose”) rather than purely protagonist-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo before silence claims it—is signaled early and deepens through the constraint that direct focus shatters resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael shifts from passive listening to active alignment via peripheral awareness, narrowing his options to near-impossible stillness. Cost is visible: physical strain, emotional exposure (the tear), and the relinquishment of control—he does not command but sanctifies boundaries. Agency is quiet but decisive: his attention *is* the consecration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into shared understanding—is signaled early and deepens as more townsfolk engage. The meaningful tightening occurs when Liam’s rigid posture softens, proving the method works. Agency is quiet but present: Elara chooses which photos to show, where to draw arcs. Cost is felt—generational bitterness yields to fragile connection—but remains conceptual rather than material, slightly muting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding growth’s true pattern—is signaled early and deepens during the suspended hush when sequences shift beyond human sounds. Aris’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen, interpret, and ultimately restore the crystal. Cost is visible in decades of isolation and the irreversible relinquishment of the prism. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens with one decisive cadence shift at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s fading visions, each loss narrowing her window to act. Her agency drives escalation: she places markers despite forgetting, turning absence into method. Cost is unmistakable—the grandfather’s memory dissolves even as the sound is found—and the tidal longing settles as quiet purpose, foreclosing easy resolution. Coincidence never resolves; the chair appears only after her ritual completes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the 1.7-second Lunar Veil—is signaled early and tightens when the Chronometer spins wildly, threatening total failure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses empathetic recalibration over force, narrowing options to a single, fragile method. The cost is felt in the “luminous ache” and the irreversible surrender to stillness; time cannot be regained, only harmonized. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with the earthquake complicating but not resolving the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—saying goodbye with truth—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s hymning of mundane rituals. The tightening occurs when the shard is woven into song, forcing Lena to move from mourning to remembering, and Arthur to reconnect with Clara’s ghost. Agency lies in attention and ritual, not grand action, fitting the hospice context. Cost is felt: the irreversible loss of Clara, the fragility of Arthur’s breath—but the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (lavender breeze) rather than fully protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering noon shadows—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that reality’s grammar changed. Pressure escalates when the orrery resists, forcing her to apply relearned runes—a direct consequence of the Great Spoon-Bending. Her agency drives every turn: inserting the key, redrawing the glyph. The cost is legible in her tears and the irreversible knowledge that this is only the first of many awakenings, foreclosing complacency.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. superstition—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth’s cleft invalidates the changeling myth. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her decision to use bone-setting logic (“acknowledging the break before applying pressure”) shifts tactics from passive grief to active education. Cost is visible: she must confront elders’ terror with evidence, risking further ostracization. The deepening—“mistakes become constellations”—narrows options to compassionate leadership, foreclosing revenge or withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crafting fireless light—is signaled early and deepens through the polishing ritual, which narrows options to patience alone. The tightening occurs when memory resurfaces: grandmother’s wisdom and Liam’s fever fuse into irreversible commitment. Cost is legible in the brass scale’s mass loss and Elara’s aching knee—visible prices that shape her slow, deliberate steps. Agency is quiet but absolute: she chooses refinement over escape.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from viral spectacle—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s refusal to wait passively. Her proactive ritual forecloses the path of public apology or deletion, trading social redemption for private integration. Cost is felt in the pendant’s loss and the irreversible acceptance that healing occurs outside digital noise. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens: each step along the icicle map deepens her commitment to earth-bound meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving authentic hope against literary nihilism—is signaled early and deepens through each cameo, culminating in the choice to leave space for the reader’s hope. The protagonist’s agency lies in attention and solemnization, not action, yet this is consistent with the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in his exhaustion and the seashell’s relinquishment, though it remains conceptual rather than material. Pressure coheres without coincidence, and the final stance crystallizes under sustained thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—remedying spiritual silence—is signaled early and tightens via time pressure (“exact moment when everything aligns”). Elara’s agency drives escalation: singing forgotten songs despite physical toll, culminating in the “Harmony of Alignment.” Cost is unmistakable: thirty years of research, bodily exhaustion, and irreversible commitment to ritual. Coincidence (moon/sun alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—her precision makes success possible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rendering ephemeral beauty permanent—is signaled early and deepens when Elara risks her alchemical identity (flash-paper = vanishing) to preserve. The meaningful tightening occurs at the blood-drop: she trades bodily integrity for translation, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost is unmistakable: aching joints, exposed vulnerability, and the terrifying void of blank paper. Escalation is driven by her agency—pattern placement, alignment, offering—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—harvesting echoes before the season’s lull ends—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s diagnostic process. The meaningful tightening occurs at noon: the shadow in the pool reveals the true failure (misalignment), narrowing options from gear repair to precision realignment. Agency is consistent—Kael’s choices drive each revelation, and luck (dewdrop, light) only complicates, never resolves. Cost is legible: the fragility of memory itself, sealed in vials like “liquid starlight,” implies irreplaceable loss if failed.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming formless anxiety into measurable weight—is signaled early and deepens through the merchant’s unspoken dread. Pressure escalates via the anxiety’s resistance (“flowing like smoke”) and Elara’s precise adjustments, culminating in calcification. Cost is visible: the obsidian sculpture’s sharp beauty, the shelf of preserved sorrows, and Elara’s acknowledged solitude. Agency is fully hers; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing grief without suppression—is signaled early and deepened by each carving cut. Agency lies in attention: Elara chooses which memory to crystallize during the kettle’s boil. Pressure tightens when the whistle shatters focus, forcing reintegration. Cost is visible in her enduring solitude and the irreversible transformation of memory into artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling eroded ambition with youthful idealism—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s fragment collection. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from gathering others’ regrets to confronting her own (“I am sorry… I was afraid”). Cost is unmistakable: decades of self-betrayal crystallize in the ghost’s empathetic shimmer. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether purpose can be reborn from abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from observation to intervention. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses redirection over restoration, foreclosing the path of forceful redesign. Cost is visible in her solitary labor and stoic endurance, though the pressure remains internal and environmental rather than interpersonal. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens the stakes’ visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens when the fork’s resonance forces confrontation with regret. The tightening occurs at the crystal: Elara must choose whether to reclaim or release her past, and she renounces by leaving the fork. Cost is legible in the “single tear” and the permanent offering. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. The pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the absence of external opposition limits tactical complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the “architecture of lies”—is signaled early and deepens when the hidden coordinates expose Thorne’s theft. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes her passion was weaponized, narrowing her options from pursuit to exposure. Agency is clear: she chooses documentation over vengeance, with cost in forfeited glory and enduring solitude. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, escalating through sensory and cognitive density rather than external action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient symbiosis—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the secret weavers guard method, not objects. Her agency drives escalation: decoding knots leads to revelation, which crystallizes her stance. Cost is conceptual but legible: she must carry not a relic but a responsibility. One tightening suffices, though physical or social price could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding healing’s geography—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s intimate projection, which forecloses the path of detached observation. The tightening occurs when she chooses presence over inquiry, accepting emotional vulnerability as the price of truth. Cost is unmistakable: tears trace her cheeks, and she inherits the queen’s burden (“You carry the map now”). Agency drives escalation—her method, not coincidence, unlocks revelation—and Kael’s wisdom crystallizes the trade-off: healing grows *within* the wound, not beyond it.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at climax when flawed genesis forces Kaelen to accept spectral over physical rebirth. His agency drives escalation: decades of hypotheses culminate in the ritual; the cost (no living Lark) is felt in golden motes dissolving. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each added component intensifies anticipation. The trade-off—legacy over miracle—is visible, poignant, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling inherited trauma through compassionate action—is signaled early and deepens through the grafting ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara embeds the coin and weaves the kelp: a physical act that forecloses passive shame and commits to active healing. Cost is felt in the tears “not of sorrow, but of compassion so deep it felt like gravity”—a conceptual price paid in emotional labor. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through symbolic layering rather than external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberating memories before dawn—is signaled early and tightens through each breadcrumb, narrowing options via time pressure and ritual precision. Elara’s agency drives every escalation: her realistically imaginative mind interprets clues, her patience waits for moonlight, her offering completes patterns. Cost is felt in the weight of collective sorrow and the fragility of fading magic. Luck (geese alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the climax hinges on her arranged circle of intention.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and tightens through each ping’s risk. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her adjustments to the gear and harmonic frequencies narrow options until the master ping. Cost is unmistakable: ancestral scars, the razor’s edge of error, and the burden of lineage. Though pressure is coherent, the absence of a live alternative path (e.g., temptation to use fire) slightly softens the trade-off, preventing 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s communal shape—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s meditation. Pressure tightens when Lyra appears, forcing confrontation with inherited tradition versus public need. Agency is clear: Elara chooses a participatory memorial over static stone, foreclosing solitary artistry for collective healing. Cost is felt but could be sharper—what does she sacrifice personally? Still, the deepening reweights her entire craft, satisfying escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance through measured time—is signaled early and deepens when the clock’s silence causes tangible harm (burned bread, missed lessons). Elara’s agency drives escalation: she ascends, cleans, pushes, adjusts—each act narrowing options until only precise calibration remains. Cost is unmistakable: the community’s trust hangs in suspension until the pendulum swings, paid in emotional labor and ancestral burden. The tightening occurs at the apex of the swing, where past and present converge into a single calibrated push.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of Albright’s intention—is signaled early and deepens through thread-decoding, which narrows interpretive possibilities until the spiral emerges. Agency lies in Elara’s attention and method; each thread untangled alters her understanding, culminating in a reconfiguration of truth. Cost is conceptual: the town’s bewilderment is replaced by a narrative of love, but no tangible sacrifice (time, tool, social standing) is shown. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, though stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within frozen stagnation—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s doubt and verification process. The meaningful deepening occurs when she mentally retraces data layers, converting uncertainty into “causality awaiting a nudge.” Agency is internal but decisive: her choice to write is the catalyst. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability, reputational risk) though not yet paid externally, which slightly limits escalation intensity for a causal design, but remains coherent under the Situational-Causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving narrative in a post-famine silence—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification: the broadcast’s fragility forces Elara into higher-risk transcription. Agency lies in attention and endurance; her choice to continue despite interference (“cloak slipped… hastily readjusted”) narrows options (no retreat into safety) and incurs felt cost (frantic pulse, constant vigilance). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each lyric salvaged raises the emotional and existential stakes. The final tightening isn’t plot-driven but perceptual—she redefines her work not as preservation but “invitation,” crystallizing stance under unrelenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing hidden grief—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s method of “absence and suggestion.” Her agency drives escalation: selecting the shard, powdering it, drawing sorrow beneath the mask. Cost is felt in the incomplete information she works with and the irreversible act of scattering ash. However, pressure remains internalized; without external opposition or secondary character interaction, escalation lacks interpersonal friction, limiting it to high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving empirical truth against myth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the tablet is uncovered. The escalation is protagonist-driven: Kael’s agonizing deliberation narrows options from “reveal” to “hide,” forcing a trade-off between validation and survival. Cost is unmistakable: “risk annihilation of his archive” versus “bear the weight of silence.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the star chart deepening the conflict without coincidence or external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether fractured voices can harmonize across old hatreds—is signaled early and tightens through the method of “subtracting noise,” which forecloses argumentative or performative solutions. The meaningful deepening occurs when Liam falters and Anya supports him, a turn driven by protagonist-facilitated space rather than external coincidence. Cost is felt in Elara’s resignation melting into awe, and in the characters’ relinquishment of defensive postures. Yet escalation leans heavily on accumulative texture rather than causal narrowing of options, slightly softening the pressure under a strict Causal lens—but valid under Accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins—is signaled early and deepens through each prune, which narrows options (removing vines = releasing specific memories). Arlo’s agency is constant: he chooses what to cut, what to plant, what to channel. The celestial alignment adds urgency but doesn’t resolve; success hinges on his labor. Cost is felt in the weight of inherited grief and the irreversible act of pruning, though the absence of tangible risk (e.g., physical danger, failure consequence) slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder vs. restoring function—is signaled early and deepens when Aris arrives seeking diagnostics. The tightening occurs when Kael chooses poetry over data, risking professional dismissal. Cost is visible: three nights of blackout, lost trust in systems, and the burden of legacy. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discerning what makes a house alive—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to sanctify via displacement, foreclosing passive observation. The deepening occurs at burial: silence thickens, time holds breath, revealing the cottage as “living tapestry.” Cost is conceptual (abandoning objective answers for faith in intentional care) and felt (tears of “hushed blaze”). Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—replacing certainty with compassionate nuance—is signaled early and tightens through Kael’s choice to use the foxglove extract via the spire’s fracture. This act forecloses rigid restoration, embracing vulnerability as the only path to renewal. Cost is felt in the city’s historical shame and Kael’s empathetic tears, paid before the garden’s rebirth. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency under an Accumulative lens, with each revelation narrowing interpretive options until dogma collapses into wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled early and deepens when the rupture delivers not fantasy but verification. Agency lies in Elara’s choice to absorb, not step through, paying the cost of enduring confinement. The escalation is protagonist-driven: decades of proof-writing culminate in the theorem that fractures reality. Cost is unmistakable: freedom is forsaken for fidelity, yet that sacrifice becomes liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s ritualistic method. The meaningful tightening occurs when the nurse doesn’t take the painting but responds with her own act (“Today, I listened longer”), which reweights the entire endeavor from proof-seeking to co-creation. This escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (leaving the canvas, choosing to watch) and carries conceptual cost: her solitude is pierced, her thesis validated not abstractly but through reciprocal action. The waxing moon and insomnia frame temporal pressure, making each night a finite window for this fragile experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving a living heritage—is signaled early and deepens when the beekeeper’s absence freezes the ritual. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes the carving, confronts Hemlock, and initiates harvest. The tightening forecloses passive waiting; the cost is ninety days of spiritual stagnation, made visceral in cold ovens and frozen hearts. The resolution demands adaptation (silver-leaf substitution), not perfection, with emotional price paid in collective vulnerability during the silent bread-sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defying time’s prison—is signaled early and deepens when the yoyo’s harmonic inversion becomes tactical. The tightening occurs at nadir tide: Elara must act now or accept scarcity’s verdict. Agency drives escalation: her reverse-engineering, clutch disengagement, and lever pull are all deliberate, costly acts. The price is felt—not in material loss but in emotional burden and eternal vigilance (“tend this new chronology until the sea forgot its name”).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unbosoming fear’s secret—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: the advisor’s shift from seeking conquest to offering compassionate witness. Escalation is driven by his agency (choosing the least comforting lie, quoting paradoxes) under the Causal lens. Cost is unmistakable: his cursed emptiness is the price of engagement, and its healing marks irreversible change. The fear-thing’s shriek (“I am the end of light!”) raises stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last orchard through harmonic collaboration—is signaled early and deepens via escalating cloud fractals that narrow tactical options. Leeward’s agency drives escalation: each “dub” is a high-stakes choice that layers frequencies, with visible cost in trembling limbs and torn blossoms. The storm’s violence isn’t coincidentally resolved but metabolized through his method, fulfilling the lens requirement that pressure tightens via protagonist action. Final cost is legible in his heaving chest and the single fallen apple—a quiet forfeiture of control.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the Watchers’ silence—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s daily ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when celestial alignment confirms her theory, forcing the high-stakes choice to play the whistle. Cost is visible: emotional burden of lost companions, city’s dread now carried as compass. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (pattern analysis), not coincidence; the crack’s “unfolding” is earned by her precise frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from a noble lie—is signaled early and deepens through Aris’s method of drawing parallels, which narrows his tactical options to quiet revelation rather than confrontation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he turns parallels directly on the station, linking its myth to broader historical patterns, thereby raising the conceptual cost of maintaining the lie. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation leans more on intellectual deepening than visceral opposition; no external antagonist sharpens immediate risk, slightly muting felt urgency. Cost is clear: loss of comforting myth, yet earned through Aris’s unwavering resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“weave recovered dreams into fresh mortar”) tightens decisively when the drawbridge clang signals the lake’s return—forcing accelerated, aching care in note placement. Agency lies in tender acts (prying stone, inscribing oilcloth) that foreclose oblivion with visible cost: blurred ink from unshed tears, boots heavy with mud-farewells. Escalation is protagonist-driven—each note stitches absence deeper—culminating in a trade-off: sealing the final message as water rises, sacrificing immediate witness for future rediscovery. The “hushed blaze” of purpose burns brighter under temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—historical truth vs. curated myth—is signaled early and deepens when the Charter’s physical anomalies reveal erasure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her alternative hypothesis leads to tactile investigation, culminating in the dual stamping that witnesses both lie and truth. Cost is conceptual (restoring silenced voices) and felt (“chest tight with quiet victory”), with the blackout imposing a live clock that heightens focus. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, narrowing from broad inquiry to one decisive palimpsest.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into bearable form—is signaled early and deepens through the paradoxical act of dream recording, which requires emotional descent to achieve luminous ascent. The meaningful tightening occurs during the basilica sequence: consciousness ascends while memory drags her down, forcing synthesis. Cost is felt in the hollow heart and dust-streaked tear; agency lies in choosing to fold again. No false resolution—grief remains, but shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s perturbation method. The tightening occurs when the vision manifests: she doesn’t just theorize, she *perceives* the pool, bearing its emotional weight. Agency is intellectual and spiritual; her “hunt” culminates in attention, not action, which forecloses vengeance and embraces witness. Cost is felt in the “tears cut clean paths through dust” and the irreversible shift from void to canvas. Coincidence (breaker reset) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight is already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering the chip to awaken the orrery and decode belonging—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the drone’s convergence forces Kael to act physically, risking failure or desecration. The escalation is driven by Kael’s agency (deploying drone, interpreting data, pulling stone), not coincidence, and the cost is felt in his trembling hands and the irreversible surrender of solitude. While the pilgrim’s arrival adds gentle pressure, the core conflict remains internal-external fusion: the chip is both artifact and emotional key. The final trade—solitude for connection—is crystallized without soft reset, and the harmonic frequency makes the cost/benefit viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective falsehood—is signaled early and deepens when the watch hand forces confrontation with suppressed evidence. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his sifting method leads to discovery, which triggers recall, which demands action. The cost is felt (“stolen her right to mourn”) and shapes the final vow. However, the tightening occurs largely internally; external pressure (Elara’s absence) limits tactical adaptation, slightly softening the escalation under a strict Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cycle of vengeance—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s insistence on celestial neutrality, a method born of past failure. The meaningful tightening occurs in the silent nod between negotiators, narrowing options to mutual trust alone; no fallback, no force. Cost is felt in Elias’s carried guilt and visible in the prisoners’ exhausted hope. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his protocols), though the eastern delegation’s emergence lacks counter-pressure, slightly flattening bilateral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling competence with regret—is signaled early and tightens decisively at Widow’s Point when poles vanish, foreclosing his terrestrial method. Arlo’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to count poles, then chooses to look up, then secures the compass as “altar.” Cost is legible: tears, shame, the “hollow echo” of past failure. The deepening isn’t external pressure but internal collapse of his coping mechanism, forcing integration over rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“kindle empathy”) tightens decisively at the lake: placing the ball risks losing his only tether, forcing trade-off between holding the past and releasing it to transform. Protagonist agency drives escalation—decoding ads, recalling obituaries—not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: the baseball abandoned, tears as proof of regained feeling. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; each decoded fragment narrows paths until only empathetic surrender remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reforging love beyond death—is signaled by line 4 and deepens via protagonist-driven escalation: arranging petals → crushing spices → surrendering her gift. The meaningful tightening occurs when beasts gather, forcing her to confront the cost of becoming “vaster and lonelier.” Agency is clear: she chooses metamorphosis despite fear, and the price—loss of mortal self—is paid on-page through bodily dissolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with spice-scent density intensifying until the veil thins.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen birth-time—is signaled early and deepens via the saucer’s crack as both wound and oracle. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: kneeling, unfastening locket, pressing thumb to fracture. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to “consecrate” rather than repair the crack, foreclosing her quest for literal recovery. Cost is felt: anxiety melts only after she releases control, making the glade’s “choking beauty” nurturing—a visceral trade-off earned by her ritual choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—opening the dimension through compassionate acceptance—is signaled early and deepens via shadow work. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each memory forces a choice between avoidance and integration, narrowing options until only unified selfhood can unlock the void. Cost is unmistakable: she must relive guilt, resentment, and extinction-level grief. The final turn—offering her stitched self, not force—reweights the entire premise with emotional and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation through release—is signaled early and deepens at the climax. The tightening occurs when Elara shifts from giving for others’ benefit to offering for her own understanding, raising emotional stakes. Agency is clear: she chooses to uncork every jar, despite it being her “only treasure.” Cost is unmistakable—bittersweet joy, dried tears, permanent loss—and the volcano’s calming hum confirms consequence. Coincidence (Mano’s prophecy) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution stems from Elara’s deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom of unlogged speech—is signaled early and deepened through Kael’s precise, high-risk actions. The blackout isn’t just atmosphere; it’s a live clock forcing stealth and timing. Agency is clear: Kael engineers the blindness, decodes the sundial, ignites the moss. Cost is visible in the fragility of the signal and the constant performance of vigilance. One tightening—the shadow slicing between six and seven—narrows all options to a single seam, driving the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring friction to save the village—is signaled early and deepens into understanding cosmic grammar. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each ritual sequence demands more star dust, dimming the aurora. The tightening choice (accepting ongoing sacrifice) forecloses easy salvation and crystallizes her stance. Cost is unmistakable: “the aurora dimmed where energy was drawn,” and her pouch feels lighter—concrete prices shaping future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming silenced pain into luminous truth—is signaled early and deepens when the mentor’s letter redefines scars as navigational. The tightening occurs at the envelope’s opening: Elara must choose between enduring silence or risking voice. Her decision forecloses passive waiting (cost: vulnerability) and crystallizes agency through writing. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve conflict. The “rarefied” voice emerges not from external victory but internal recalibration, with stakes felt in every withheld then released word.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding truth to enable reconciliation—is signaled early and deepens through needle alignments that narrow interpretive options. Agency is clear: Elara’s meticulous adjustments drive escalation, not luck. Cost is felt in the vulnerability of “open hands” and the relinquishing of adversarial fencing for collaboration. Slight deduction: breeze-induced shadow shudder risks coincidence, but she integrates it as a variable, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy through collective rebuilding—is signaled early and tightens when Elara fears her molt will abandon “stone and mortar.” The deepening occurs in her vulnerable admission to Kael, forcing a trade-off: trust transformation or cling to a single persona. Agency drives escalation—her anxiety prompts Kael’s reassurance, which catalyzes her surrender. Cost is felt: Silas’s granite resolve is lost, yet the seed planting affirms continuity through change.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping grief’s prison through love’s cipher—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the liminal hour. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes the film, plays the sonic key, follows the compasses. The cost is unmistakable: risking emotional collapse for a chance at closure, paid when the clock moves and she must return to ordinary twilight. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory before monsoon erasure—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s dream interpretation, which demands surrender of her empirical comfort. The tightening occurs when she chooses to hum the melody despite “luminous doubt,” narrowing options to faith or failure. Cost is legible: she trades verification certainty for vulnerable interpretation, and the ridge’s golden luminescence proves the price was worth it. Agency is total—no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens through the lace’s woven directives, which narrow emotional options from raw regret to mindful observation. The tightening occurs when Elias chooses to witness fully rather than flinch, foreclosing denial at visible cost (tears, vulnerability). Though internal, the conflict escalates texturally: silence thickens, then diffuses into cerulean acceptance. No external antagonist needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.
