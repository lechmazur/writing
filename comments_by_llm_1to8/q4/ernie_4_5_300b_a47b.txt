  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering meaning from chaos via dust analysis—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chrysalis emerges and sheds dust in a spiral pattern, reweighting her hypothesis. Yet the symposium choice (ignoring institute scorn, presenting dust slides) lacks visible cost: the botanist's interest is supportive, not a trade-off. The pressure accumulates under an Accumulative lens, but the ending offers no foreclosed path or felt price, only affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose after survival—is signaled early, and the frost-reading method provides one meaningful tightening as Lirael follows patterns to the hidden chamber. However, the escalation remains investigative rather than conflicted; no live cost or trade-off narrows her options on the page. The final decision to return to her studio and teach is stated intent without visible price, and the smuggler's blade/fall backstory creates setup tension but doesn't recur to pressure the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—proving silence can be expressive—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fork emits a clear tone, and the lullaby memory provides a second pressure point. Yet both breakthroughs succeed on first attempt without visible failure or tactical adjustment, flattening escalation. The worldwide concert resolution summarizes consequence rather than dramatizing cost on the page. Elias's presence complicates but does not truly oppose; coincidence (his arrival, visitor interest) advances rather than tests the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reviving the city's distress signals—is signaled early and drives the middle repair sequence. Pressure tightens once: Elias resists, then commits after Marisol's appeal. The lens activation is a vivid turn, but the aftermath ("Ships above altered course") tells rather than tests consequences. The final choice to stay is summarized without showing what Elias gives up or wrestles with on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, but the cost at closure remains declared rather than dramatized, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—building intergenerational trust under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens once when Mira's bell declaration forces the community from anonymity to visibility. The cost is legible: donations cease, replaced by direct exchange, and the widow's whisper confirms a foreclosed path. Yet the escalation compresses key beats into summary ("In the days that followed"), reducing the felt weight of the gamble. The council's skepticism offers mild opposition but dissolves without dramatized confrontation, and Mira's agency—while decisive—encounters no on-page failure or adaptation that would deepen pressure under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early but never tested. Lira walks, follows light, kneels, and receives understanding without a single on-page reversal or tightening choice. No visible cost narrows her options; the breathing and the pool's glow arrive as solutions to a question she never struggled against. Coincidence (the embers, the tree, the pool) delivers resolution without protagonist agency altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and pursued through a single escalating action: placing the fragment on the bench, triggering visions, causing the garden's disintegration, then its reformation. The piece lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options; Elara's action succeeds without a visible tradeoff. The "quaking reverie" passes, leaving her with clarity and a new goal, but no prior want is sacrificed, no cost paid that alters her tactics. The escalation is atmospheric (visions surge, bridge collapses) but not causal in the chosen Accumulative lens: the density increase doesn't foreclose a path or force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reach the vault and free the seeds—is signaled early, but escalation relies on the scavengers' late arrival rather than protagonist-driven tightening. Lirael's puzzle-solving (inserting keys) proceeds without meaningful reversals or cost; each key works in sequence without friction. The climax choice (hurl the vial to root the scavengers) feels coincidental rather than a trade-off shaped by prior constraints. The instant vine-growth offers spectacle but no visible price paid for using the only vial.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early but remains abstract. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when she adds the root to the crucible and the mixture erupts, yet this turn is the result of serial ingredient gathering rather than a choice that forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. No visible cost attaches to her final success; she assembles the device, wears it, and smiles. Agency at closure is decorative rather than causal under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (steal the jar) is clear, and the lily/starlight bypass provides one tactical turn. The jar's demand for a trade creates a second pressure point, but it arrives unearned—no prior clue that moonbeams require exchange. Elara's agency is present (she offers the photo), yet the stakes never genuinely tighten because the jar "illuminates" rather than takes, eliminating the trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs, but cost is blunted by the too-kind resolution. No persistent constraint or visible loss alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—finding blueprints for safe zones—is signaled early but never escalates into a meaningful on-page tightening or trade-off. The discovery of the schematics is a stroke of luck (the thaw reveals a hidden compartment) rather than a consequence of Kael's agency or prior choices. The final "abandonment" of perfect answers is a conceptual shift announced rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. No credible loss or constraint shapes his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (proving vulnerability is power) is declared but never tested by a genuine on-page trade-off; Lila's phobias don't hinder her escape, and the enforcer's threat deflates the moment she recites the notes without consequence. The tightening (enforcer arrival) generates local tension, but the escalation bypasses protagonist agency—the mob boss's arrest happens off-page, and Marisol's reappearance lacks earned friction. Cost is asserted ("first, you have to earn it") but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—drawing the map of endless night—is signaled early, but escalation remains flat. Mara encounters no reversal or meaningful resistance; the fort groans "as if annoyed," a gust rattles the archway, yet she "didn't stop" without visible friction. The ending declares success ("She'd done it") with no on-page cost, trade-off, or tightening that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake is required; here the work proceeds smoothly to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding the origin of thoughts) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The violin discovery and temporal loop entry provide one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven—Unit-17 encounters "versions of itself" and realizes the program was "a test," but these revelations arrive without struggle or trade-off. The robot remains "remarkably composed" throughout, which undercuts the sense of mounting cost. The final choice to resume sweeping lacks visible sacrifice; clarity is granted rather than earned through renunciation or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the forecourt's secrets and understanding unspoken honesty—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the ticket discovery, lens use, and Lira's arrival, but no reversal narrows options with visible cost; Elias's cooperation with Lira flows smoothly without friction or sacrifice. The resolution (becoming a "translator of silence") unfolds as realization rather than a choice that forecloses a live path, leaving escalation muted under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving human touch matters against algorithmic measurement—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara blocks a sensor to force recalibration. However, the maze's compliance reads convenient rather than hard-won: it "seemed to respond" without dramatized resistance or cost. Joren's skepticism dissolves in a single hour with no setback or complication. The resolution bypasses genuine struggle; Elara's methods work on first demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (prove time moves sideways) is signaled early, and the nexus destabilization provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Veyra's options. However, the resolution—successful recalibration—restores the status quo without visible cost; no trade-off or forfeited path is dramatized. The director's appearance and Veyra's second lever-reach feel like setup for a future conflict rather than closure of this one. Agency is present (Veyra's technical choices) but does not foreclose a live option or impose a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unravel the code to prove the ghost exists—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates as symbols match her sheet music, the date surfaces, and the pipe bursts, but escalation reads as external complication rather than protagonist-driven tightening. Clara's agency is observational: she dips the program, traces symbols, memorizes the code, then makes a promise. The reversal (program slips from her grip but she's already memorized it) functions as a micro turn, yet no prior choice narrows her options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The ending promise is Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens, but the tactical price or foreclosed path remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Lirael will continue as the station's complicit oracle or break with the lie. The QUARANTINE folder discovery tightens her dilemma, and her descent with the illustration forecloses the oracle path with on-page cost (director's rage, crew whispers, her smile of relief). The accumulative lens allows pressure to build through peripheral awareness and smudging rather than a confrontation, and the herbalist's recognition validates her choice. One meaningful tightening (folder → decision to leave) is sufficient and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the buried secret—is clear, but escalation is thin: Elias encounters locked doors (the concrete cap, the control panel port) that the valve wheel conveniently opens without trade-offs. The hologram's confession is delivered to him rather than forced by a choice under pressure. The final decision to leave the valve is framed as renunciation ("too heavy to carry"), yet no on-page cost—lost proof, social consequence, identity shift—is made legible. One tightening occurs (the valve unlocks the chamber), but it doesn't narrow options or charge the ending with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reaching the regenerative silence—is signaled early and sustained. The journey tightens through each fold, with the keeper shedding layers of self at the black water pool and yielding the petrified door. The final turn (the river vanishing, replaced by stone) forces a reconfiguration with visible cost: the keeper's "grip on reality now a faint echo." Agency is clear in the choice to sit, let go, and rise transformed. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; the cost is legible though somewhat softened by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (Can Mara embrace wonder?) is signaled early and receives one tightening when the curl glows. However, the escalation is not protagonist-driven: the glow happens to Mara while she closes her eyes, not because of an active choice she makes. The resolution (Mara keeps the curl) lacks visible cost—no prior path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The piece meets the minimum bar of one meaningful shift but does not demonstrate agency-driven escalation or legible price under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: restoring the displaced axis by acknowledging ignored stories. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the axis is "the line between hearing and ignoring." However, escalation is largely cognitive—transcription, cross-reference, realization—without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The protagonist's final act (placing palm on wall, opening mouth to speak) lacks agency-driven cost; the tapestry's autonomous stirring grants closure rather than Elias's decision forcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to take up her father's covert network—emerges clearly in the safehouse. The descent into the tunnel tightens pressure, and the dockworker cookie at the end demonstrates agency. Yet the escalation feels smooth rather than costly; Elara's decision to continue arrives without visible trade-off or friction. The story signals high stakes (slow-burn revolution, governments) but the on-page choice costs her nothing—no renunciation, no visible price paid. The "accidentally prophetic" fortune she writes is clever but lacks causal link to her final act.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"before the possession completes"—is declared but never tests the protagonist on the page; no countdown, no approaching threat, no visible consequence. The loops and paint application escalate in volume and visual effect but don't narrow options or force a trade-off. The anchor's disintegration is not driven by the priest's agency under pressure; it simply happens after he performs his ritual. No visible price paid; the priest achieves his goal without renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—becoming conductor of unheard symphonies—is declared but never tested by a reversal or cost on the page. Lirael writes fortunes as intended, the shell responds as expected, and the ending affirms success ("it was enough") without narrowing options or introducing a trade-off. Exhaustion is mentioned as a looming threat but never materializes to force a tightening choice, leaving escalation absent.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding her place, grounding herself—is signaled early but remains abstract. The tablet's holographic fork (left vs. right path) sets up a choice, yet Mara's selection of the right path produces no on-page consequence that narrows later options; instead, timelines dissolve and reconfigure without her agency shaping the turns. The montage of alternate selves (first love, vigilante) is summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation reads as thematic accumulation without a visible tightening or cost. The ending's descent is a stance crystallization, but the price—letting go of drifting—is asserted rather than tested by a prior reversal where she loses something concrete to gain grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and sustained. The story offers one meaningful tightening when the copper wire replaces the needle and reversed music triggers sensation, narrowing Lila's approach. However, the escalation is more told than shown: "her numbness began to fray" summarizes the turn rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path. No visible trade-off or loss constrains her later teaching; the resolution grants equal satisfaction without cost, and Elias's role as facilitator rather than obstacle flattens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing the quarantine zone—is signaled early and maintained. One tightening occurs when the recorder's biohazard alarm confirms the threat, narrowing Elias's options. However, escalation depends on coincidence: the woman emerges to guide him, hands him the vial, and provides the press as an off-page solution. The final choice to "deliver" the message lacks on-page cost; Elias smiles and adjusts his recorder, foreclosing no visible path. Agency is reactive rather than driven by protagonist decisions under the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and tightens once when Kael begins untying knots, narrowing his options from passive observation to active unraveling. Yet escalation depends heavily on the being's prompts rather than Kael's agency; the choice to untie versus cut is proposed but not forced by prior pressure. The final spiral offers a reweighting, but no live option is foreclosed on the page with felt cost—Kael gains insight without visible trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (transform grief through music) is signaled early and tightens once when Lira discovers the bowl holds space, not silence, narrowing her tactic from solo performance to communal ritual. Agency reads through decision (positioning violin over bowl) and attention (acoustic sensitivity guiding placement). The crowd's shift from silence-as-wall to silence-as-threshold supplies one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Escalation is modest; no live option is foreclosed with sharp cost. The final act (carrying the bowl outside, inviting offerings) reweights the stake but feels more ceremonial than decision-under-fire.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake is implied (crafting a precise elixir for Lira) but never tested or escalated. Lira's single moment of hesitation ("Will it hurt?") dissolves immediately with Elias's smooth reply, and the blotter-petal test confirms success without complication. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Elias operates with complete control and no visible price paid. The resolution is a satisfied transaction with no earned alteration or renunciation. Under any drive lens, pressure remains flat from setup through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Clara's shift from transactional efficiency to relational compassion—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition. The mistaken-address mystery dissolves without complication (the boardinghouse woman simply hands over the locket), and Clara's decision to forge the conductor's letter encounters no friction, consequence, or self-doubt. No reversal or tightening narrows Clara's options; each step unfolds as benevolent addition rather than costly trade-off. The postcard arrival months later summarizes outcome rather than dramatizing escalation. Pressure remains static and declarative rather than coherent and rising under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Kael's desire to "graft himself onto community"—is signaled early and drives the search. However, the search itself unfolds as a series of discoveries without meaningful resistance or trade-offs. Lira's clue ("follow the angles") leads directly to success; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts under pressure. The reveal that Lira is Veyra provides information but no reversal of Kael's trajectory. The resolution avoids coincidence but lacks agency-driven escalation; Kael's arrival at the clearing completes the search without visible cost or a choice that narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where echoes are born—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The pendant twist provides one meaningful tightening (time lurches, the tunnel opens), and the tunnel sequence deepens understanding. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens needed a second pressure point or visible cost; Lila's return to the rooftop resets her to sketching with "the pendant cooled," but no on-page trade-off or foreclosed option appears. The cost is conceptual (she now knows the truth) but not felt in a way that alters her present tactics or stance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her brother's final message—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual tightens when the glass eyes resonate with the mosaic, but the escalation lacks genuine reversal or rising cost. Elara's agency is present (she devises and performs the ritual) but the resolution feels granted rather than earned; the mosaic shifts and delivers insight without her having to trade off or endure a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs, meeting minimum sufficiency, but the felt cost at closure is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the tape's message—is signaled early and drives Mara's journey through the pipe chases to the decoder. The discovery of the recorded message ("you're not alone") provides information but does not force a visible trade-off or narrow Mara's options on the page. The ending claims she is now "a guardian, a keeper of secrets, and now, a messenger," but no action or cost demonstrates this transformation. Escalation is present as curiosity deepens, but the closure lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor's need to understand and control her plants—is signaled early and tightens when the hellebore retracts. One meaningful pressure point occurs when Mara grabs her wrist, forcing Eleanor to withdraw and watch rather than intervene. However, this reversal is externally imposed rather than driven by Eleanor's agency, and the subsequent transformation happens *despite* her, not because of a choice she makes under duress. The final declaration ("I'm going to help them by releasing control") promises future action but doesn't enact a trade-off on the page with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Marin's search for the "something" missing from her art—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: she walks, finds a brooch, accepts an exchange, and paints successfully. The stranger's offer introduces a potential complication, but Marin's hesitation is brief and costless; no live option is foreclosed, no tactical trade-off dramatized. The painting's transformation happens off-stage, and the ending declares resolution ("finally learned how to listen") without showing a price paid or path renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to magnify everyday magic and control the cave's unpredictability—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: the pilgrim's arrival doesn't narrow her options through agency; she passively accepts the pearl and the transformation happens *to* her. The shattering crystals and the pilgrim's dissolution are spectacular but don't stem from Elara's decision. No visible price alters her tactics; the ending recounts a change without showing what she lost or chose to forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—compiling fractured history—is signaled early and pursued across three sites. Each visit yields a fragment (journal, fisherman's tale, locket), creating a pattern of accumulation rather than escalation. No reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off; the method succeeds without friction, and the trumpet's restoration feels inevitable rather than earned by a choice under pressure. The lack of visible cost at closure keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reaching the fortress—is signaled early and drives the sequence of moves (following arrows, opening the wall, descending). However, escalation is linear puzzle-solving without meaningful tightening or tradeoff; each step grants access rather than forcing a choice that narrows options. The woman's appearance and her declaration that "the fortress is a choice" hand Elias the thematic insight without requiring agency; the updated map is gifted rather than earned through a decision with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Clara's search for clarity amid noise—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tile's memories flood in, raising the question of whether to trust the supernatural or retreat to logic. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective rather than driven by protagonist decisions that narrow tactical options. The transcription scene provides a deepening beat, but no visible price or trade-off is dramatized on the page; the tile simply "glows faintly" and "relieved of a burden" without Clara forfeiting anything concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escape from eternal entrapment—is signaled early and tightens when Lira offers the joint escape option, forcing Kael to trade known boredom for unknown risk. The storm's peak provides a ticking clock and the mirror reflection showing the hollow future self narrows options with visible cost. However, the escalation compresses into the final third; most beats before Lira's arrival involve observation rather than choices under pressure. The coincidence of Lira appearing exactly when the storm peaks and fragments align does complicate but borders on resolving the conflict, weakening protagonist agency in the setup phase.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake (asylum for Elara and her father) is signaled early. One reversal occurs (Elara steps out, reveals the dummy) but it's a reveal rather than a tightening born of her agency—she had control all along. The agents' guns-to-negotiation shift lacks on-page escalation or visible trade-off. The one-hour negotiation is summarized ("she traded the scroll for asylum papers") without dramatized cost or friction, so the escalation curve flattens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake is "to collect the textures of different times," but this remains abstract and unchallenged throughout. No opposition, cost, or reversal appears; Althea sits, writes, and succeeds without friction. The lamp-hum moment briefly suggests something unusual, but she simply writes faster without forfeiting anything or narrowing options. The ending summary—townsfolk now respect her—is told rather than dramatized and introduces no visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering Kael's erased identity—is signaled early, but escalation occurs primarily through discovery rather than agency. Kael collects fragments passively; the storm complicates his search, but he doesn't make a choice that forecloses options or trades one value for another. The locket revelation tightens understanding, yet the final vow ("I will find them") defers consequence off-page. One meaningful deepening (identity confirmed) is present, but visible cost at closure is absent—no loss of safety, relationship, or belief system occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving the astronomer's riddle wasn't madness—is signaled early, but pressure remains constant rather than escalating; Lira faces no meaningful resistance, failed attempt, or trade-off before the shell and cello sync on the first try. The shell's vibration and the dials spinning are atmospheric effects rather than complications that narrow her options or force a pivot. The resolution ("solved...with empathy") is asserted rather than tested; Lira's agency at closure is interpretation, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake (preserve carnival autonomy vs. privatization) is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the graffiti-mapping plan and the Council confrontation, but escalation lacks a visible price: Lira's reorganization succeeds without apparent cost, and the Council's withdrawal is narrated passively ("withdrew") rather than forced by a sacrifice or tactical gamble on Lira's part. The spiral-square symbol provides one reversal (deadline warning) that narrows options. Jax's torch-lit solidarity adds texture but does not impose a new complication. The ending offers hope without foreclosing a path or dramatizing what Lira has given up to achieve this temporary victory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—to document and leave a signal before drones arrive—is signaled early, and the 17-minute countdown adds temporal pressure. Yet the escalation is largely external (drones en route) rather than driven by Lira's agency; she executes her plan without reversal, adaptation, or visible trade-off. The drones arrive "seconds later," but Lira is "unbothered"—no cost is legible in the moment, and the epilogue's satisfaction undercuts any sense of forfeiture or endurance with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—ensuring HB-7 is flawless for the maiden voyage—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Marlow immediately provides the correct diagnosis ("misaligned servo"), and Lira's repair proceeds without setback or forced trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the drone's successful hover validates her method but costs her nothing. The timeframe (dawn launch) creates theoretical urgency but never visibly pressures her tactics or forces a compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the rivers' true source—is signaled early and pursued coherently. However, escalation is primarily environmental (wind, ice, glowing veins) rather than driven by Clara's agency under pressure; she follows the falcon and chips ice, but no meaningful tightening forces a trade-off or narrows her options. The discovery resolves the quest through external revelation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Jorn's warning "You'll die out there" introduces mild opposition but never materializes as genuine threat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—revival of the ghost town—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is ornamental: each tuning-fork strike simply adds another element (footsteps, cobblestones, fountain, bell) without resistance, cost, or a narrowing of options. No on-page reversal forces Kael to alter tactics; the town wakes in a smooth accumulation that never tests his method or patience. The townsfolk's arrival and transformation occur as a consequence of Kael's work, not through his agency in that moment, and no visible price is paid—he walks away satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the temple before the storm floods it—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Mara's instinct to smash the vial is overridden in one line without visible cost, and the storm above never materializes as on-page pressure. The "unsnarling" of voices is a told intensification rather than a dramatized escalation that narrows options. The protagonist's final act (placing the vial, swimming up) lacks agency; the hush dissolves on its own and she simply witnesses. No credible loss or forfeiture alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias must "thread a labyrinth with his own story" to differentiate himself from his father's lies. One meaningful turn occurs when the doppelgänger reveals the lattice as pen and labyrinth as page, reframing Elias's task. Yet the escalation is conceptual rather than narrowing live options—Elias encounters no visible trade-off or loss that alters his tactics. The ending stance ("I'm writing") crystallizes his intent but forecloses no path with on-page cost; the hush remains a prelude without consequence paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing the cursed lover/stone bead and the ghost herself—is signaled early but never tested by a choice with visible cost. Elara's placement of the bead against the fruit is discovery-driven, not a decision that forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The escalation (hum intensifies, veil lifts) is atmospheric rather than tactical, and the resolution is handed to her by the orchard's mechanics. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (Elara's curiosity) triggers the release without protagonist sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (restore the labyrinth) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure is present but static: Lira sews thread after thread without encountering meaningful resistance, setback, or forced trade-off. The sleepwalker and murals add texture but do not complicate her task. The final stitch completes the goal, yet the resolution feels preordained rather than earned through a pivot or sacrifice that narrows options. One meaningful tightening or deepening under pressure would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (restore the shrine/faith) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial emits its tone and the chamber glows, forcing Lirael to choose whether to follow the thread. However, the choice is narrated as internal summary ("a thread she could follow or let unravel") without on-page cost—no visible price, no tactic altered, no path foreclosed in scene. The "warmly curious" attribute and "purposeful but unhurried" pacing dilute urgency rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (decode the margin messages, discover her grandmother's legacy) is signaled early and pursued across beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when the carrier arrives and Lira scans the new letter's margins, but the escalation is informational rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure—each clue is a breadcrumb laid for her, not a choice she wrestles with cost. The hologram revelation delivers emotional intensity but no visible trade-off; Lira's decision to continue the work is declared ("She'd continue") without foregrounding what path she forecloses or what immediate price she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving celestial truth before the coup—is signaled early, and the council's telescope-moving announcement introduces urgency. Yet the escalation reads as ambient rather than causal: Jaxon brings news, Zara performs a candle demonstration, but no live choice narrows her options or forces a visible trade-off. The "synchronizer" moment hints at a method, yet we do not see Zara act on it with cost—does she risk exposure, lose time, forfeit safety? The ending reweights meaning conceptually but does not articulate what price she pays or what path she forecloses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—evoking unsent letters to face unspoken regrets—is signaled early. The ritual in the clearing provides one meaningful deepening (condensation letters appear, Lirael reads and traces them), but no live option is foreclosed and no tactical trade-off emerges. The spirits' songs and the shard's glow add texture but do not narrow Lirael's choices or raise cost. The resolution (walking away "lighter") is declared rather than earned through protagonist agency that alters tactics under the chosen Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto loss, operationalized through translating the girl's cast—signals early and tightens once when Lira moves from private decryption to public gesture (coral at negotiating table). That beat deepens emotional register but does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off; the delegates respond amenably, and no fallback plan or cost (professional risk, personal vulnerability) materializes on the page. The girl's anxiety "unknotting" and Lira's ache "softening" are asserted outcomes, not dramatized prices. Accumulative pressure builds through recurring motifs (coral, cast, ache), meeting the lens requirement for one meaningful deepening, but agency at closure reads passive—Lira offers an object and a line; the world cooperates without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy versus the fog's silencing pressure—is signaled early and tightens through the display preparation. The display itself becomes the key escalation: what Lira expected as "requiem" transforms into "resurrection," a meaningful reversal driven by community response. Marla's recognition and dance crystallize the stakes with visible emotional cost (Lira's breath catching, hands trembling). The knowledge network and children chasing light-words add secondary pressure that converges at the ending. The piece earns its open resolution through Lira's commitment to continue ("bigger this time, louder"), which forecloses the path of quiet resignation she'd been walking.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unveiling the mural's secrets—is signaled early. The nickel placement and frequency alignment create one meaningful tightening when the mural splits and dancers flicker. However, the escalation relies on Dr. Lysander's exposition rather than Marisol's agency under pressure. The flapper woman's wink and the lullaby are atmospheric but don't narrow options or force a trade-off. No visible cost forecloses a path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—gaining entry to the Silent Bloom club—is signaled early but resolved halfway through when the cicada-masked leader announces "meets the criteria." The second-half shift to activating the garden lacks opposition or cost; spores mix with the seed's resonance, the soil glows, and news outlets buzz. No live option is foreclosed, no tradeoff dramatized. The pheromone test is the only moment requiring agency, but success arrives within seconds without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—turning pain into beauty—is signaled early but remains abstract across centuries. One meaningful deepening occurs when the postcard prompts Lira to venture outside and write bolder verses, yet the moss bloom and insomnia fade happen to her rather than through her agency. The tree's appearance is coincidental (seed replaces postcard), not driven by protagonist choice. The final act of singing is Lira's decision, but it does not foreclose a prior path with legible cost; pressure accumulates without a tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the chime's song to keep extinct feelings dormant—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the director declares the tube irreparable, forcing Lirael to improvise. However, escalation lacks cost: her humming and singing succeed without friction, the glass-orchids respond cooperatively, and the resolution arrives without trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The actualized lens (Accumulative/Textural) permits deepening over causal turns, and the final reconfiguration reweights preservation, yet agency is muted—Lirael's creative choice feels thematically inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust with Mira—is signaled early via the crumpled invitation. Elara's research provides thematic deepening (the love letter's "Do not dam it with silence" mirrors her own situation), but this remains parallel illustration rather than escalation that narrows options. No on-page reversal or tightening choice forces a trade-off; the path from archive work to phone call is smooth and unobstructed. The ending offers no visible price: Mira answers readily, agrees to meet, and Elara's smile suggests resolution without cost. Coincidence (Henrik offering the sister manuscript at midnight) facilitates rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (decrypt the message) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—each measurement brings Lira closer without complication or reversal. The cipher's solution arrives on schedule; no live option is foreclosed. "I fear the floodgates will fail" introduces a secondary concern (external safety) but remains unconnected to the decryption puzzle. Agency is present (she chooses to measure and decode), yet the cost is conceptual only, not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the meteorite chip and his grandfather's legacy—is signaled early and tightens through weeks of decoding. The dream delivers a knowledge reversal ("the echo isn't in the stone...it's in the space between") that narrows options. However, the escalation is primarily reflective; Elias ignores clients and decodes, but no on-page choice tests commitment with visible cost until the final departure, which arrives abruptly. The constraint (dust mapping) shapes tactics, but the peak choice lacks the dramatized friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the prisms align to reveal the hidden path, but this feels coincidental rather than earned by Lira's prior choices. The light-door materializes after she writes in the logbook, offering a reversal, yet the father's appearance carries no visible friction or trade-off. The resolution hinges on Lira's decision to step through, but walking away from the terrace is narrated as effortless ("not fearless but featherly determined"), undercutting the sense of foreclosed paths or opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and sharing the luminous alignment—is signaled early and unified. The alignment arrives as anticipated, with sensory intensification rather than resistance or reversal. Mara invites others and they gather; no friction emerges, no tactical adjustment required. The accumulation of bioluminescence provides textural escalation under the chosen lens, but protagonist agency remains observational. The cost is the researchers' earlier skepticism dissolving, not a visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (discover why paths disappear) is signaled early, but escalation remains conceptual rather than embodied. Lira sifts, conjectures, and receives visions without meaningful resistance, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The seeds and shard "answer" her question in the pool without requiring a decision or forfeiture. No visible price is paid; the final insight arrives as exposition rather than earned choice, and prior tactics do not foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving that predictable rhythms can be disrupted—is signaled early and sustained. The sequence shows one tightening when Lira plays the deliberate discord and the crowd responds, but no reversal or trade-off narrows her options. Agency is present (she chooses the notes, the discord), yet the crowd's compliance arrives without resistance or visible price. The teen's payment and promise to return feel like reward rather than cost, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (renewing her skin's constellations) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Lirael performs each step—stealing, dancing, inscribing—without friction, adaptation, or trade-off. The nostalgia ban "wavers" without consequence, and her elective exile means she faces no enforceable pressure. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the resolution declares success without dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (illuminating value in the mundane) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful deepening occurs; Elara's ritual proceeds without opposition, friction, or trade-off. The resolution (she feels peace, takes a note, plans to return) is presented as fulfillment rather than earned by struggle. Agency is present as attention and ritual, but no path is foreclosed with visible cost—she leaves "lighter," suggesting reward without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias's need to reconcile guilt and find a language for pain—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through memory and the decision to open the box, but escalation is gentle; no reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The hourglass offers acceptance passively ("You are not broken") rather than through Elias's agency. The ending reconfigures his relationship to fire and scars, but the shift feels received rather than fought for, and no concrete path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: bridge fractured realities via experimental pattern work. Pressure accumulates through the trial balloon's ascent and the gauge's wild needle spin, then the vista of parallel skies. The moment when the gauge's needle steadies and points to a coordinate represents a tightening, but no live option is foreclosed; Elara simply gains clarity without trade-off. The reference to "versions of herself give up" is backstory comparison, not on-page resistance. No antagonist or competing desire complicates the peak beat. The ending commits her to further trials, but the cost is deferred rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes the dreams are her own. The walls' groaning and the ivy's shudder add situational pressure, and her decision to burn the negative and take the locket narrows options. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven reversals; the diaries and locket appear as discoveries rather than choices that alter tactics. The cost at closure is conceptual (accepting the burden) but not sharply visceral or foreclosing a live alternative with felt tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and drives all three mirror beats. Pressure tightens as effort mounts (first glow, second flicker, third sweat/cracked mirror), and the bells' interruption provides external tightening. However, the resolution is soft: Lirael "knew" success occurred elsewhere, removing on-page consequence. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path; exhaustion doesn't alter her next move. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present (coded lullabies adapting to each mirror's mood), but cost at closure is asserted rather than shown, capping higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—achieving a signed treaty—is clear and signaled early. Pressure coheres through the negotiation arc with one meaningful tightening when "tempers flared" and Elara intervenes. However, escalation is largely summarized ("posturing," "accusations," "slow erosion of trust") rather than dramatized through specific reversals. The treaty signing feels inevitable rather than earned by on-page choices with visible trade-offs. Cost is asserted ("her heart heavy yet hopeful") but not concretely legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the extinct bird's echo—is signaled early and tightens through the placement ritual. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options with visible cost. The philanthropist's actions (placing egg, pouring water, walking away) form a sequence but lack a turn or price that forecloses a path. The immediate pivot to "his next project: a luxury resort" undercuts any felt sacrifice. The thunder's approach and retreat provide atmospheric pressure but do not force a choice with on-page consequence. One meaningful pressure point is present (the release gesture) but cost legibility at closure is insufficient for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—defying conformity by freeing trapped echoes—is signaled early but never tested. Lirael's dance encounters no resistance: threads loosen "as if grateful," the door swings open on cue. No reversal, no tightening of options, no moment where her method fails and forces adaptation. The "lullaby of conformity" remains abstract background hum rather than an on-page antagonist. The ending delivers satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (exploring ethical storytelling through performance) is signaled early and sustained. The puppet-role reversal provides one meaningful tightening that shifts the crowd from skepticism to nervous laughter—a visible reaction. However, Elias's serene confidence never wavers; no live option is foreclosed, no tactical adjustment forced by resistance. The drifter's scoff is deflected, not engaged, so the escalation reads more as illustration than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake: to honor the moth's overlooked history by signaling the monarch. No meaningful tightening occurs—Lirael completes her lattice without obstruction, the monarch arrives on cue, and she resumes her practice. The interrupted cadence of her breathing and knotting is described but never escalates or forces a trade-off. Agency is present (she acts), but the work yields no reversal, no cost, and no narrowing of options. Pressure is steady ambient rather than accumulating with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving his mother's voice—is signaled early and pursued through the rope ritual. Pressure tightens when the braids resist, then glow, but escalation is primarily mechanical (rope responding to card) rather than driven by Kael's agency or a trade-off that narrows options. The resolution (Lira's appearance, names glowing) is triggered by the rope's mechanism, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. No credible loss or omission alters tactics; Kael's hands tremble but complete the task without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("why some paths choose their walkers") is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No meaningful tightening or deepening: the hologram explains the answer, Mara closes her eyes and "understood," then walks outside. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible price. Agency is passive reception (heating the seal, watching the hologram, inviting the storm) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the attempted Accumulative lens, pressure does not cohere or escalate; the storm "broke" and "passed" without altering Mara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake ("seeking answers / bridging empirical and unknown") is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wall opens and the voice challenges her, but her reply ("I seek to seal a pact") is assertion without visible trade-off. The tiles merge via cosmetic alignment rather than agonistic choice. Cost is declared ("curiosity") but not felt: Elara emerges with "steps lighter," no forfeited path or live option closed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (teaching release) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: each visitor receives the same ritual without complication or cost that narrows Lirael's options. Kael's skepticism ("This is a trick") is the only moment of resistance, yet it resolves in a single exchange without altering tactics or risking failure. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path; the story accumulates examples rather than building pressure. Agency is present (Lirael's ritual choices), but the absence of meaningful trade-offs or visible prices caps the score in the mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and drives the collaborative reconstruction. One meaningful tightening occurs when synchronized breathing activates the mirrors and sextant. Yet the stranger's off-page success and Elias's closing realization lack visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. Agency is present in the decision to help and the craft labor, but the resolution's cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—keeping the orchard alive—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal tests it. Lira finds the cracked eye, mends it without complication, and the orchard blooms in response; success arrives without a tightening that forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The breach of contract is backstory; within this scene, no escalation or deepening occurs. The micro turn (catching the ribbon mid-air) is gestural and does not narrow options or change knowledge under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding the nonlinear inheritance. The discovery sequence tightens once—grotto vision shows fractal possibilities, then the map guides her to the tree—but escalation is gentle. Elara's agency at closure (pressing the cameo) enacts the inheritance, yet no live alternative is dramatized: she never weighs retreat or a different choice. The board's prohibition is mentioned twice but never tests her on the page. Cost is implied (she'll never convince the board, some truths are "lived, not exhibited") but remains conceptual rather than visceral. One meaningful deepening occurs; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (find the Library of Unlearned Lessons) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian demands she decode *Silence*, narrowing her path. However, escalation is thin: the poisonous-fungi book sidestepped without consequence, and the guardian's test resolved quickly via intuition and childhood tune. The final cost—entering the library—feels more like arrival than renunciation; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and Kael's presence dilutes agency at closure. Coincidence (Kael vanishes, map fragment appears) complicates but borders on convenience plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the garden to "recapture what the world stole"—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Veyra's skepticism ("myth," "trapped freedom") offers no real obstacle; she acquiesces immediately when the garden appears. The seed's instant sprouting removes the need for protagonist agency at the peak. The final act (sewing their name into soil) is a decision, yet no visible price or trade-off is paid on the page; the twins simply "finally felt whole." One meaningful tightening occurs (the hidden door), but pressure does not narrow options or force a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—accessing lost knowledge—is signaled early and remains consistent. Pressure tightens once (gear jams, shadows shift, door opens), but escalation is shallow: Elara's steady competence faces no meaningful trade-off or live dilemma. The ending reconfigures her self-concept, yet this shift lacks an on-page cost; she successfully copies the scroll and returns unscathed, with no visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake—restore silence—is signaled early and tightens when the mapkeeper presses the stone to the spiral. The bloom's materialization narrows options (the energy beings' static falters) and the placement enacts the resolution. However, no visible tradeoff or loss accompanies the act; the mapkeeper simply succeeds, and the cost is ambient ("they were wind through leaves") rather than a price she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to shatter the hush—is signaled early and pressures Elara's actions (tracking stars, bleeding hands, storm scramble). The storm provides one meaningful tightening that forces her to adjust the shard under duress. However, the resolution hinges on coincidental moonlight and a late-revealed hollow in the mosaic, undercutting protagonist agency; the cost (bleeding fingers, exhaustion) is visible but does not foreclose a live option at closure, landing closer to atmospheric struggle than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to record the event evolves into sculpting identity from experience. One meaningful tightening appears when the fog begins to fracture ("Time was running out"), forcing hurried measurement at the second monument. However, the escalation is more temporal than causal; Lirael's agency—measuring, conjecturing—does not foreclose a path or generate a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution (packing quill, walking on) feels earned by elapsed time rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reigniting her craft after the pavilion disaster—is signaled early. The note and the knot's pull create a tightening, and placing the knot on the lily triggers the chain reaction. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than causal: Lira's choices (following the light, kneeling, placing the knot) are sequential but not forced by mounting opposition or cost. The resolution (fortress blooms, she laughs) asserts transformation without an on-page trade-off or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: bridging the relational impasse with Kael through her chronicler's method. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara shifts the cicada and then verbalizes the metaphor, narrowing the conversational deadlock. The escalation is driven by her agency (choosing indirection over confrontation), and Kael's nod registers a trade-off—tension eases but full resolution is deferred. Cost is visible in the sustained pause and the requirement for tangential approach, though the final image stops short of showing what specific path was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lila's need to escape claustrophobia and collect silence-flavors. The gravity-inversion countdown tightens the tactical window, and her choice to cling versus return under her father's call provides one meaningful pressure point. The doll's loss mid-scene delivers visible cost that forecloses her tangible anchor. However, the resolution (sprout discovery) feels more like thematic consolation than a protagonist-driven choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off; the sprout arrives as gift rather than through Lila's agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (teaching silence to comfort) is signaled early but remains abstract; no live alternative or trade-off pressures Elara's observational method. The vial's stillness is a discovery moment, not a tightening that forecloses options—she doesn't renounce a prior tactic or pay a visible price to gain the insight. The resolution ("adjust her routes") feels like an add-on plan rather than a consequence of foreclosed paths. Escalation under the inferred accumulative lens requires a deepening or cadence shift that reweights cost; here the pressure flattens into contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise—is signaled early and drives the first two-thirds. The mural sequence offers one escalation (ruby flake unlocks the staircase), but the guardian trial resolves through a question rather than agency that forecloses options. The ending asserts metaphorical transformation without visible cost: Lira "didn't sit" and descends unchanged in capability or social position, undercutting closure pressure. No persistent constraint shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—holding fading thresholds versus reaching out—is signaled early and tightens when Elara uses the ring. Kael's arrival and threshold crossing provide one meaningful turn. However, escalation is more atmospheric than agentic; the sanctuary "shudders," but no on-page obstacle tests Elara's decision or forces a visible tradeoff between isolation and connection. The resolution (standing together, gripping hands) feels collaborative but lacks the foregrounded cost or tactical alteration that would push pressure into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (rising pressure threatens farm collapse) and tightens once (diamonds unstable, "we die"). The turn—Mara's decision to turn the bolt—narrows options, but cost is obscured: the farm "stabilizes," mushrooms "thrive," no visible loss or trade-off appears. The quantum device's instruction removes doubt and flattens agency. One meaningful pressure point exists, but resolution feels gifted rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early and pursued coherently. The gramophone sequence tightens pressure through escalating vibration and visions. However, the final revelation (letters explaining the dynasty's choice) arrives without Lirael making a decision under competing costs; she passively receives information and then declares intent. No live option is foreclosed, and the standing-wave method resolves the mystery without tactical trade-offs shaped by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—escape stasis and capture the greenhouse's essence—is signaled early and tightens when Cedric unsnaps the marionette strings, triggering the staircase descent. The orb-shattering moment is a reversal, but it arrives as passive discovery rather than a choice with visible tradeoff. Agency is diffuse: the vines pulse, machinery screams, reality shifts around him rather than because of his decisions. The final wheat-field transformation is a granted state change without prior cost that would foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: recover the story behind the button and honor the forgotten child. The date reveal (April 12, 1865) is a meaningful deepening that reweights the boy's history and Elias's understanding. However, escalation is accretive rather than constricting—no reversal narrows Elias's options or forces a trade-off. The final act (labeling a new folder, beginning to write) is generative, not renunciatory, and no visible price is paid; he gains insight without forfeiting an alternative or enduring a cost. Agency is present but unfolds as discovery, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (expose the Council's erasure of dissent) is signaled early and drives the infiltration sequence. The three-minute countdown and alarm provide on-page pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drones force Mara and Jax to dive blind, raising immediate physical risk. However, escalation stalls at closure: the relay station explodes (externally convenient), the drones retreat with no pursuit or consequence shown, and Mara hands off the drive with a smile—no trade-off, loss of ally, or tactical cost that narrows her next move. Agency is present (she plans, dives, grabs the drive) but the resolution hinges on luck (the explosion stops the drones) rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early and drives Elias's playing. The figure's arrival and recoil create one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens: Elias's music intensifies, the figure flickers and dissolves. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost; Elias plays until his lungs burn, then the threat simply vanishes. The prophecy's status at closure is ambiguous ("postponed" vs. "hushed"), so the price remains conceptual rather than legible. The figure's dissolution reads more as a successful ritual than a choice that narrows options, which keeps the score in the mid-6s despite clear pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early and the moonstone dust prod tightens the problem by enabling legibility. However, escalation is mild: the discovery unfolds smoothly without false starts, trade-offs, or visible prices paid in the moment. The final "I know what I must do" declaration lists consequences (storm, silverseed, Lirael) but does not dramatize a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the compass to gain truth/certainty—is signaled early and tested in the fall sequence. Pressure tightens when Elias digs and tumbles, but the compass's spinning needle deflates urgency rather than escalating it; the protagonist laughs and interprets rather than faces a trade-off. The workshop return plants new action (clockwork garden) but the story doesn't dramatize what live option Elias forecloses or what cost he pays on the page for embracing uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding Lira's disappearance and redeeming himself—is signaled early and tightens when the coin's glow intensifies and he whispers "Show me." The vortex arrival and Lira's appearance narrow options (she's not alive in the expected way; she "shed" her name). Cost is visible in the empty-air grasp and her instruction to accept cracks, but the escalation from search-to-acceptance feels slightly compressed; the middle beat (coin drop to vortex) lacks a second tightening reversal that would test Kael's resolve more sharply before the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—integrate laughter into healing—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or a visible price. Lira walks, listens, steps forward, and receives the solution (the laughter-feeling) without forfeiture or tactical shift. The figure's question ("What do you fear?") prompts a single admission but no on-page escalation; the misaligned harp softens into a lullaby without Lira's agency driving the change. Closure arrives as gift rather than earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to "measure what's unmeasurable" / mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The woman's challenge ("Mercy isn't an equation. It's a choice") provides a verbal tightening, and Elias's decision to walk deeper suggests acceptance of the question as ongoing, but no prior tactic or fallback is visibly abandoned on the page. Agency is present (he chooses to press into the forest, to hold the strap), yet escalation remains conceptual rather than a concrete narrowing of options or a dramatized trade-off with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the lens fragment—is signaled early but never encounters meaningful opposition or a trade-off. The fragment "demands intuition," yet Lira's method (tracing breath rhythm, palm scars) unfolds without friction or a narrowed choice. No visible cost accompanies the retrieval; the weaver's acceptance is frictionless. The piece deepens atmosphere but does not escalate pressure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped ghosts—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias finds the hidden compartment and reads the papers, deepening his "understanding." Yet this is discovery without agency cost: no choice narrows options, no visible price alters later tactics. The ghosts "fade" as a result of Elias's passive acknowledgment, not a renunciation or decision that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric detail but does not crystallize into a charged trade-off at closure, leaving escalation functional but un-costly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to rupture the library's order and awaken "something older"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spiral anomaly appears and she prints the pattern, forcing the rupture. However, agency is enacted without visible friction: the patrons gather but do not oppose her; the risk ("unravel not just the library but the very clouds") is declared but never tests her resolve on the page. The "transformation" is told ("not destruction but transformation") rather than shown through a tactical price or a renunciation with felt cost. Escalation reads as spectacle acceleration rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—proving the Luminari's fraudulence—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition. The Council "declared him a heretic" and "tore down his drapes," yet Kael had already planted the fungi before the storm, so the conflict is retrospective. No reversal narrows his options; the fungi bloom exactly as planned. The ending summarizes weeks of mounting evidence rather than a single tightening choice. Agency is preparation, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—repairing the "infected by midnight" music box—is signaled early and tightens when Elias diagnoses a moral ailment rather than mechanical failure. The widow's confession ("I knew he lied") is the hinge that enables resolution, narrowing options from mechanical fix to truth-telling. The cost is felt: Lira must vocalize her husband's cowardice and her own complicity in silence. One clear escalation occurs when the box's whine threatens permanence until truth is spoken. The protagonist's agency is diagnostic rather than renunciatory, which keeps the stake from reaching higher intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: finding untouched petrichor and understanding the expedition's fate. The descent tightens options (narrow fissure, compass pull, psychometry visions), and the lagoon encounter deepens knowledge of "where explanations fail." However, escalation is more accumulative than decisively narrowing—Lira faces no live choice between competing goods or immediate cost. The compass dropping and lagoon rippling complicate but do not force a renunciation; she simply collects samples and leaves, so agency at closure is observational rather than a foregrounded trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the island's fractured timelines—is signaled early. The lantern slide discovery and archway portal provide one tightening that changes knowledge, but the grandmother's "You're late" and cascade of images are delivered without trade-off or decision cost. Lira's agency at closure is passive reception; she blinks back and "understands" without forfeiting a live option. The turbine-hum vibration and slide warmth suggest intensification, but no on-page choice narrows her path or makes the cost of understanding legible.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother's postcards and the window's language—is signaled early but never tightens into genuine pressure. Mara's investigation proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or cost: she climbs, traces, paints, and catalogs across months with no failure or trade-off. The inscription "The dark nourishes what the light scorches" arrives as convenient revelation rather than earned discovery that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (uncover hidden codex before regime descendants do) is declared but never tested through on-page reversals driven by Mara's agency. The antagonist's reveal and chamber collapse happen to her rather than from her tactical choices under pressure. The ending asserts "bought time" and "truth's out there" without dramatizing what was gained or lost; no live option was foreclosed with visible cost, and coincidence (trapdoor conveniently placed) resolves the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (revival of the cove) is signaled early, but escalation is diffuse: "days passed, then weeks" compresses the work without showing a tightening that narrows options or raises cost. The transformation (lanterns brighten, net fills, ghosts materialize) happens through accumulation rather than a protagonist decision that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is needed; here the final image reconfigures meaning, but the lack of a visible price—Elias endures no renunciation or foreclosed alternative—keeps the cost conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the accidental prophecy—is signaled early and coheres through the listening beat. The discovery of the harmonic hum beneath the shriek provides one meaningful deepening, narrowing Voss's interpretation from "terror" to "warning." Yet no on-page decision alters his tactics or forecloses a live option; he confirms a pre-existing mission (archiving) without visible trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates but the final image of watching stars feels like a pause rather than a tightening that charges the closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (reopen the path via vortex sacrifice) is signaled early, but escalation reads as a sequence of described transformations rather than narrowing options. Lirael faces no on-page obstacle or adaptive pressure; the creature cooperates, the seeds sprout instantly, and the vortex "pulls" her without resistance. The final state (sapling, melting ice) arrives without a legible trade-off or foreclosed alternative. Under the inferred lens (Causal/Accumulative hybrid), one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the protagonist's actions do not force a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—testing the bell's tone and managing storm response—is signaled early and escalates when the new tone agitates dormant winds. The switch from single-rope to alternating rhythm represents a meaningful tactical shift under pressure. However, the resolution feels convenient: Veyra's guidance removes the burden of discovery, and the calming of the clouds lacks visible cost or sacrifice. Agency is present but diluted; the protagonist reacts more than she risks.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Zara's pursuit of "flourishing stillness" and empathy with the stars—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The walk to the crater proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or a choice that narrows options. The star's fadeout is atmospheric but does not impose a price on Zara or alter her tactics. Veyra's critique in the opening could have supplied friction, but he softens off-page without dramatized pressure. No escalation or deepening occurs; the arc is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the weight of unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens through the box's glow and the ghosts' message. Yet the escalation is passive: Elias observes the box morning after morning until it pulses and instructs him to speak. No reversal narrows his options; coincidence (the box lighting up) resolves the pressure. The lack of visible trade-off or foreclosed path at closure caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering time's texture—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the fragmented capsule, the architect's notes, and the urn fragment's symbolic weight. However, escalation relies on atmospheric shifts (hum deepening, shadows moving) rather than choices that narrow options or impose visible trade-offs. The moment Elias places the fragment beside the coil, the mercury stills and his wife's face appears, but this feels like a symbolic reward rather than a turn earned by protagonist agency under pressure. The ending forecloses no live option; Elias "no longer needed" numbers, but what did he sacrifice to arrive there? The cost reads conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the incomplete"—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no live option is foreclosed, no on-page trade-off or cost materializes. The kite-string snap offers potential pressure but deflates into metaphor rather than complicating Lira's work. The tapestry completes without obstacle; the fisherman's nod affirms rather than challenges. Accumulative texture is present, but escalation and felt consequence are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—remodel to foster interspecies respect—is signaled early and tightens through the copper-wrapping sequence. The ground rumble at noon and the spirit's materialization constitute one meaningful reversal under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present: Lira's choice to wrap the final wire triggers the light eruption and the spirit's acceptance. Cost is conceptual (her death cements the bridge) but not viscerally felt as a trade-off in the climactic beat; the ease of "acceptance" undercuts escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—exposing or uncovering the Enclave's truth—is signaled early. The amber placement tightens pressure in one beat, but the dissolution and inversion produce spectacle without a visible tradeoff or tactic shift. Lirael's final longing is asserted by the event rather than forced by her choice; coincidence (the amber's effect) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early and remains coherent, but pressure never tightens. The coachman encounters no obstacles: the seed pods crack open, roots seek purchase, bird calls guide him, and he rides away with a light heart. No reversal or deepening forces a trade-off; the storm "gathering on the horizon" is spatial backdrop, not a complication that alters his tactics or costs him something on the page. The piece offers accumulative texture but lacks the meaningful tightening or felt cost required for higher escalation scores under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering secrets to bind the settlement—is signaled early. The riddle sequence provides a pattern of solutions but lacks escalation: each answer arrives smoothly without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. No on-page cost accompanies the discoveries; the settlement simply cheers. The final "love" riddle does not test commitment or create friction, reading as thematic capstone rather than pressure-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (finding order/true north in exile) is signaled early, but escalation is more thematic than tactical—no live option is foreclosed by the glimpse or grandmother's appearance. The final path choice (left-right-up) occurs without visible cost or trade-off; Elio's shift from hesitation to trust is asserted rather than tested. One meaningful tightening exists (compass needle points to the past), but it complicates conceptually without narrowing on-page options or forcing a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (amend the imbalance to prevent collapse) is signaled early and persistent. Escalation reads as atmospheric intensification (sky darkens, chamber shakes) but never narrows Kael's options or forces a visible tradeoff; he simply moves faster through the planned sequence. The final king-swap is positioned as climactic but no live alternative or price is dramatized—success arrives without a forfeited path or credible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—unbinding the board's secrets to document unseen gestures—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs on the third night when the king topples and pieces stir, but this event happens passively to Elara rather than through her agency. Her response (walking "unbind" in reverse) prompts the reconfiguration, yet the escalation lacks visible trade-offs or costs that narrow options. The interregnum and missing pawns frame the puzzle but don't force a choice with on-page consequences, leaving pressure more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding "the shape of home"—is signaled early. One tightening occurs: Lirael moves from avoidance to pressing the feather, which triggers the vision and shattering. Agency is present but passive; the stone acts upon her more than she wrestles with it. The cost (pain, embedding shards) is asserted rather than shown to foreclose an option or force a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal; the sequence intensifies atmospherically without a second beat that narrows her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness and breaking the curse) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Alaric plucks the black thread and the memory surfaces, narrowing his path to separating guilt from redemption. The pedestal moment crystallizes the choice, but the resolution—threads weaving into one strand, village unfreezing—feels driven by the labyrinth's magic rather than Alaric's agency under pressure. No visible trade-off or foreclosed option at closure; the world simply "shifts" and time resumes without cost that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the elders' ritual to "refract a single truth into many"—is declared early but never tightened by on-page resistance. Kael paints one word, recites one verse, and the spire immediately responds with light; no reversal, no failed attempt, no visible trade-off between competing goods. The elders' chants "falter" and one woman hisses, but this is token opposition that evaporates without forcing a mid-scene pivot. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation should read as density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the climax is a single declarative act followed by immediate vindication. Cost is deferred to "tomorrow" rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning or redemption from the statue via the charm—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through repeated attempts ("pressed the charm," "pressed harder"), the acid sea's roar, and Lira's respirator removal. However, escalation is largely textural: intensifying description rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No live alternative path is foreclosed; the workshop's gears still, the acid stills, and silence arrives without a visible pivot that cost Lira something specific (a tool, safety, another goal). The final act reweights theme but not tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding solace or beauty in fractures—is signaled early but remains abstract. The wrong turn and left-path choice constitute a tightening, yet no live option is foreclosed: Elias could return to the quay unchanged. The vision and placement of the shell feel like affirmation rather than a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is present, but the cost at closure is told ("weight lifting") rather than shown as a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and tested on the page. Elara's humming and exhalation create one meaningful tightening when the cork glows and the sea churns, narrowing her doubt into action. Thalos's validation adds a micro turn that deepens rather than reverses. The fisherman/wife pause registers the outcome but does not escalate further or present a visible trade-off. No persistent constraint (time, stamina, social cost) shapes tactics after the initial attempt, and the ending delivers proof without a felt price paid by Elara—her tears mix with rain, but no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss, summoning old routes—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the cryptic phone calls and the building ritual, each instruction deepening commitment. Yet escalation reads as additive rather than narrowing: each call adds a task without forcing a trade-off or foreclosing an option. The hydraulics failure provides a situational trigger but does not reappear to complicate later choices. The ending certainty ("she felt certain she could map it") releases tension rather than sustaining it; no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—psychological safety in a post-virus world—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page beat tests Mara's commitment through competing goods or visible loss. Jorn's arrival with the ledger introduces a potential complication, but Mara's response ("We occlude") resolves it declaratively without a tightening choice or visible price. The storm and the ledger's threat never force a trade-off that narrows options. One micro-turn (Jorn's revelation) exists, but escalation under the Causal lens is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the boutonnière and recover stolen memories—is signaled early and pursued through investigation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman reveals the captain scuttled the Aurora and stole her memories, raising moral weight. Yet the escalation lacks a live constraint or visible price: Elias encounters no resistance (the woman cooperates immediately, the trunk opens on first try), and his final vow to "return them" doesn't narrow options or trade off a competing want on the page. Agency is present but not tested; coincidence (the woman waiting at the exact moment) complicates setup but doesn't force a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the doorway/chip to escape stagnation—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation lacks a meaningful tightening: Lila follows the map, descends, finds the chip, experiences a vision, and returns without a reversal or trade-off that narrows options. The doorway vision offers insight but no on-page cost or tactical shift. Pressure remains linear rather than deepening, and the resolution ("not in the cavern, but in the journey") is declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early and drives the climb. One tightening occurs when the figure confronts her with self-knowledge, but that pressure arrives via dialogue lecture rather than protagonist agency narrowing her options. The queen's decision to descend reads as acceptance without visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative; no price is paid on the page (no injury, lost resource, or altered tactic).

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—revive the nexus's fading embers—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Jorin presents the ledger, offering a conceptual method ("palette of resolve") that reframes Elara's approach. The climax hinges on her letting the shell guide the engine rather than forcing resonance, which narrows her tactical options. Yet the escalation reads more as theme application than agency under duress: the ledger arrives by coincidence, and Elara's shift from "force" to "let" is a declared insight rather than a trade-off with visible cost (no tool destroyed, no ally alienated, no time penalty paid). The three prior engine explosions are summarized backstory, not on-page reversals that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling "chronological confusion" and escaping the weight of past selves—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the scroll's discovery, the ritual instructions, and the arduous climb, but escalation reads more as mystical unveiling than agency-driven tightening. The protagonist follows clues rather than making a charged choice that narrows options. The ending dissolves jealousy into acceptance without an on-page act or visible price; the "feral nostalgia" reframes as compass, but no path is foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: decode Mrs. Voss's unresolved guilt and return the screw with meaning. Pressure accumulates through clues (engraving, photo, trembling hands) but remains investigative rather than agonistic—Lira faces no friction, constraint, or trade-off. The tightening (engraving → Eleanor connection) deepens knowledge but does not narrow Lira's options or force a sacrifice. No visible loss or renunciation alters tactics. The resolution is a gift (polished screw, note) without cost to Lira, trending toward wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake—transforming his scars/failures into mastery—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens in the ritual sequence: ink crystallizes (complication), Kael fears miscalculation (reversal threat), then the rune flares and reshapes his scars (resolution). However, the climactic beat lacks a visible price or forfeited option; success arrives without a dramatized cost at the moment of closure. The protagonist's agency is present (he carves the rune, chooses to descend), but the escalation curve feels smooth rather than steeply contested, and no live option is foreclosed on the page to earn the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias reconnecting with his sister's memory—is signaled by midpoint. The escalation through Clara's metaphor ("music is vibration... energy can be channeled") and the glowing drop narrows options toward completion of the piece. However, the tightening relies on a late-introduced magical mechanism (the drop's glow and voice) rather than building pressure from established constraints, and the cost (finishing imperfectly) is more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is declared but never tested by opposing pressure. No reversal narrows options; the Witness wanders, sees a vision, and emerges enlightened without sacrifice. The mural figures speak in riddles that do not complicate the goal. Agency is observation, not decision; the protagonist's "understanding" costs nothing on the page and alters no tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation operates through the counting ritual (100→1) that tightens pressure and narrows perceptual focus until the fjord clock revelation. The ticking from the water and key vibration create a meaningful turn that reweights the entire premise. Cost is visible in Lorn's solitary knowledge and his return to the oblivious station, though the stakes remain more conceptual than visceral—no concrete path is foreclosed beyond his prior ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—Clara seeking meaning in chaos after her father's death—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. The subway-car "journey" offers no visible obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off; she simply rides, chooses left at a fork based on memory of her father's lectures, and returns unharmed. Coincidence (the car lurching, Ms. Greer vanishing, the instant return) drives all movement rather than Clara's agency under pressure. One micro-turn exists (choosing left over right) but it carries no legible cost and the resolution—"she'd visit her father"—defers action off the page rather than enacting change here.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—connection through wrong numbers—is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. Each call resolves smoothly without reversal: David gets Elise, the child stops crying, every misdirection finds its match. No tightening or deepening occurs; pressure remains flat across beats, and Mara faces no trade-off or cost that forecloses a path, leaving the piece without meaningful escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: ensuring the covenant's survival through preservation. The story signals this early and maintains focus, but escalation is minimal—Elara faces no opposition, reversal, or tightening choice. She arrives intending to document and paint the locket, and she does exactly that without complication. The "haunted euphoria" and fear that "beauty fades" are told anxieties, not dramatized pressures that narrow her options. The final realization is a conceptual deepening rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake ("cure for loneliness") is signaled early, but Elias never faces a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The conductor's arrival shifts the scene from quest to lecture; the ghost "negotiates" off-page, and the rock simply "flares" without Elias making a decisive choice. The resolution hinges on the conductor's monologue rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price (time, stamina, opportunity) is paid on the page to earn the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding his mother and the hidden stillpoint—is signaled early and tightens through the river dig and map discovery. One meaningful turn occurs when the ring vibrates "Dig" and Elias uncovers the emotional map. However, escalation under the accumulative lens remains steady rather than deepening; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost until the final image, and that moment asserts reunion without dramatizing what Elias sacrificed or lost. Agency is present but smooth; coincidence (the case in the silt, the mother waiting) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—fixing the blight and the girl's fever—is signaled early and tightens when Lira shows the fractured timeline. The holographic projection narrows options (he sees alternatives, understands the web), and the anomaly's stabilization provides on-page consequence. However, escalation is driven by Lira's guidance rather than Elias's agency; he watches, listens, and complies. The cost (walking away, committing to apology) is legible but mild, and the fever breaking happens off-page in the web rather than as a trade-off Elias visibly pays.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or scarcity. Kael's intent to "disrupt the harbor's quiet rhythm" meets no resistance; Lira joins willingly, the crowd assembles without friction, and the music succeeds effortlessly. The night's achievement is declared to fade "like all things," but no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows Kael's options or exacts visible cost. Escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the archive's hidden message—is signaled early but never tightens. Mara moves room to room without opposition or cost; each act of "vandalism-turned-art" succeeds on the first attempt. The acid burn healing when Mara paints a tear is coincidental resolution, not earned by her prior choices. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the ending reveals information (grandmother's face) rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the lagoon's glow mirrors his sorrow—is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page choice. The reversal (from haunted to hopeful) occurs via summary: "I felt the sorrow lift, replaced by a fragile hope." No visible cost accompanies the drumming; the act resolves tension without foreclosing a path or forcing a trade-off. Agency collapses when the secondary character instructs Eli to drum, rather than his rebellion driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—winning the challenge by proving whispers work—is signaled early and tested once when Elias contrasts his silence against the shouting hauler. That moment narrows his tactic and validates his theory, constituting one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is mild: no reversal forces a harder trade-off, and the resolution (emerging at dawn, coin raised) does not foreclose a live option with on-page cost. The supervisor's grumble and the final whispered tune confirm success but do not impose a visible price or transform the initial stance beyond validation. Agency is present but not tested under compounding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.4)
    One dominant stake is implied (to comfort the canal through light), but no on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. Lira's actions unfold in a single uninterrupted sequence with no opposition, complication, or cost that narrows options. The fisherman's question and the cat's appearance are ornamental rather than pressure points. The "stillwater tension" is declared but never tested, and the resolution ("the canal's whispers grew gentler") is told rather than earned through a protagonist decision with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lila processing her father's abandonment and death—is signaled early and deepens through Clara's revelation that the father "loved this grotto" and "remembered" Lila. However, the escalation occurs primarily through exposition (Clara tells Lila facts about her father) rather than through choices that narrow options. The seven chess games are summarized in a single paragraph ("Lila lost them all") instead of dramatized, missing the chance to show a tightening choice or tactical trade-off. The ending's agreement to "keep planting" reconfigures Lila's stance, but the cost is conceptual rather than visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—leave the island, find freedom—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through on-page opposition or trade-off. The whale's call and the scrimshaw's warmth guide Lira toward the climax without resistance or cost. Releasing the scrimshaw triggers the island's disappearance, but this coincidental magic solves the problem without Lira paying a visible price or losing an alternative path. The ending declares liberation but shows no agency-driven escalation or felt consequence under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (cultivate lightness through creation) is present throughout. Pressure is lateral rather than escalating: each step of the whittling—finding grain, shaping bowl, smoothing, polishing—advances the ritual but no reversal or tightening forces a new choice or forecloses an option. The mandate as antagonist remains off-page; no enforcement team arrives, no internal temptation to stop surfaces and is overcome. The final act (placing spoon beside bouquet, vow to carve again tomorrow) is Earned Stasis with felt resolve but minimal on-page cost—no visible sacrifice, stamina limit, or tactical shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"dissolution of boundaries"—is declared early but never tested by resistance or tradeoff. Lirael's actions (speaking, touching quartz, stepping onto water) succeed immediately without complication, escalation, or visible cost. The story presents a smooth ascent from intention to magical fulfillment with no reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options. The "ban lifts" framing suggests prior constraint, but that pressure is absent on the page; she encounters no obstacle, internal conflict, or price that would force agency or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: prove he's "not as dull as his paintings" via the plant arrangement, then find color/meaning through cobalt dust. One tightening: mural erupts in fractals revealing Marla's phoenix-shard backstory. Agency at closure: Elias chooses to keep painting, but the decision costs nothing visible—he gains dust, gains vision, gains approval. Coincidence resolves: the moth whispers "Awaken," cobalt dust conveniently unlocks color, tourists appear to validate. No trade-off or foreclosed path; the ending awards satisfaction without sacrifice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the climax, then diffuses into declarative summary ("His canvases would never be the same").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection's texture—is signaled early and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes the cave itself is an instrument, deepening her understanding. The ending crystallizes a stance ("We keep questioning") with conceptual pressure, qualifying as Charged Poise. Yet the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or tactical constraint; the lens discovery solves the mystery without Lira forfeiting a live option or paying an on-page price. Agency reads as observation more than decision under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to atone by mending others' grief—is signaled early but remains declarative. Pressure is announced ("subdued thrill," "burning certainty") rather than dramatized through reversals or forced trade-offs. The night's work (folding cranes, adjusting lanterns) reads as ritual execution without complication; no live obstacle tests his commitment or narrows options. The ending reconfigures his understanding, but the path from hollowed shadow to steady hands is smooth summary, not escalation with visible cost. One meaningful tightening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns post-crash—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara teaches Mara to "multiply paths," shifting from solo practice to collaborative method. Yet escalation lacks a visible price: Mara's shift from "frayed" skeptic to eager student proceeds without on-page cost or trade-off. The final "rebuild" promise feels like setup for future action rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase is present but the closure beat does not charge the stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—pursuit of forbidden knowledge versus the elders' warning—is signaled early and coherent. The pagoda's hum and glow provide one tightening moment that deepens Lirael's resolve, meeting the minimal 600–800 escalation requirement. Agency appears in her decision to embrace the light and walk deeper, but the cost is not legible on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship severed. Kael's departure is unexplained and feels like a convenience rather than a consequence of Lirael's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope's shape—is declared early but escalation depends on exposition (Thalos explaining metamorphosis) rather than protagonist trials. The one reversal (shadow as metamorphosis, not glitch) arrives via dialogue, not Lirael's agency under pressure. The final act solves via the correct word without a visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. Thalos hands Lirael the second stone and the insight, softening the causal pressure that should tighten her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing both the tail and Lira's fractured purpose—is signaled early and tightens through the act of precision work. One meaningful deepening occurs: Lira's realization that "fragility could be a strength" reweights her understanding of compassion. However, escalation is primarily reflective; the physical reconstruction unfolds smoothly without setbacks or tactical shifts forced by material constraint. The cost (shedding fear, guilt, and the handlers' judgment) is felt but not dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or renunciation that narrows live options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested. Mara encounters no obstacles; the psychometry reading succeeds immediately, the crystal behaves as expected, and the final revelation (love "just waiting to be noticed") arrives without requiring a difficult choice or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The flashback supplies emotional texture but does not escalate present-tense pressure. Mara's agency at closure is a whispered declaration and a smile, both affirming rather than transformative. The story reads as a sympathetic unveiling rather than a conflict arc with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early but never faces a trade-off or tightening that narrows options. The archway opens without resistance; the chamber contains exactly what Kael seeks; the stardust grants fulfillment with no price paid on the page. The voice's reassurance ("You're close," "Creativity isn't trapped. It's waiting") removes tension rather than escalating it. No meaningful escalation or deepening occurs; the plot is outline-like and-then sequencing without protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—repair the clock to cultivate sparks—is signaled early, but escalation is thin. The woman's explanation supplies the solution ("become occasionally everywhere") rather than forcing Kael to trade off or forfeit something live. The twist-the-hands action feels symbolic rather than costly; no visible price (stamina, memory, relationship) narrows his options or charges the ending. One tightening occurs when the sand dims, but the final image of tiny flames lacks legible trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—rediscover the wild frontier of her mind—is signaled early. The pedestal/gear moment tightens pressure once, but Elara's agency is passive: the forest "teaches," the father's hologram "explains," the gear "vanishes." No on-page trade-off where she must forfeit one good for another. The resolution arrives via external instruction rather than a choice that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused courage waits—is signaled early but remains abstract; the guides encounter travelers and stamp tickets without meaningful resistance or trade-off. One tightening occurs when the ridgeway shifts and tests them, but no reversal narrows options with visible cost. The clearing arrival and punch placement feel like ceremonial completion rather than earned escalation; Lira's decision to leave the punch is undramatized, and the return journey ("no easier, but he no longer feared") summarizes growth instead of showing a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elric's role as silent keeper of the fortress's safety—is signaled early and tested by Lady Veyra's arrival. The wobbling bench constitutes one reversal that tightens pressure, and Elric's choice to speak and fix the bolt provides a second turn. However, the escalation is modest: the consequences of his neglect (healers working overtime, dimmed walls) are told rather than shown constraining his options, and the resolution—guests falling silent in awe—lacks visible cost or trade-off. The price of breaking silence is asserted thematically ("some costs were worth paying") but not dramatized as a foreclosed path or concrete loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early but never narrows Veyra's options or forces a trade-off. She possesses the solution from the outset and encounters no meaningful resistance: guards patrol "beyond the doors" but she bypasses them off-page. The celestial convergence ticks in the background but does not tighten tactics. The pretender's dissolution is spectacle without cost to Veyra, and the courtiers' instant recognition completes a frictionless arc.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and drives assembly of clues. However, escalation is tepid: Kael's dismissal poses no obstacle Lira must navigate, and the bioluminescent coordinates arrive as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The storm complicates but does not test commitment. The decision to follow the path is announced, not earned through a visible trade-off or cost, leaving the tightening incomplete under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reignite the rebellion—is signaled early, and the "alignment" deadline provides a ticking clock. However, escalation is thin: Jax's skepticism softens with minimal friction, and the peak ritual faces no on-page complication or test. The resolution arrives via external flare (stones, wind, voices) rather than a choice that narrows Lira's options or exacts visible cost. The hum's crescendo is atmospheric, not a pressure valve forcing trade-offs. One meaningful tightening is present (the alignment window), but the lack of on-page sacrifice or failure risk limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unseal the embryo to evolve tradition—is signaled early and pursued with one meaningful escalation (digging, opening the vault, seeing the futures). The final placement in the springs occurs without on-page opposition or a visible trade-off; the plants sing, the springs wake, and Nana smiles. No tactic is abandoned, no resource is spent, and her decision to "tell the crews tomorrow" defers consequence off the page. The piece delivers one pressure point (the vault opens) but does not land a felt cost at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Lila seeks stillness to counter PTSD paralysis. Pressure accumulates through sensory layering (stone, lavender, gulls) but lacks a live tightening that narrows options. The wind-gust flinch is a micro turn, yet Lila's recovery via anchors feels rehearsed rather than costly. Mrs. Voss's arrival and advice offer comfort without opposition. The ending claims agency ("I want to anchor optimism") but the choice to tuck away the photo carries no visible forfeiture—no rejected path, no trade-off. Cost is felt thematically but not dramatized as a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping the city's indifference and reclaiming meaning through art—is signaled but never tested on the page. Elias collects threads, tears a card, paints; none of these acts face opposition or narrow his options. "When the walls began to close in" is told twice but never dramatized as a tightening choice. The ending arranges symbols without visible cost or forfeited path. No meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens; the plateau structure lacks the density increase or cadence shift required to reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding her brother and understanding the time anomaly—is signaled early and sustained. The story tightens once (ink reveals the tower), but the escalation lacks a trade-off or visible cost; Lira's path from encampment to tower door is linear without meaningful opposition or narrowing of options. The child's insight deepens understanding conceptually, yet no on-page reversal forces Lira to sacrifice or endure. Agency at closure is gestural (turning a handle) rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to awaken Kael and risk Council wrath—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lirael slides the letter into the control panel, narrowing her options. However, the escalation lacks a visible price at closure: the story asserts the Council will come and the revolution begins, but no on-page consequence or trade-off is dramatized in the final beat. The coincidence of Kael's immediate understanding and cooperation resolves tension too smoothly. Agency is present in Lirael's decision, but the cost remains projected rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"weave continuity through chaos"—is signaled early but never tested by a complication or tightening. Lira's actions (digging, embedding the scrap, checking plants) advance ritual without opposition or cost. The sandstorm remains offstage decoration. No on-page reversal or choice narrows options; the resolution is asserted ("The farm, once a refuge, had become a revolution") rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is present and pressure accumulates through dissonant patterns and the goddess's appearance. However, Kael's agency is largely reactive—adjusting the emitter, striking the spike—without a meaningful trade-off or choice that narrows options. The goddess's dissolution stabilizes the constellations, but this outcome feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist decision. One tightening (goddess encounter) occurs, but escalation lacks visible cost that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (exposing family corruption vs. preserving legacy) is signaled early and coheres under the Causal lens. The midnight call establishes stakes, the handwritten memo escalates by personalizing the betrayal ("Don't let Clara see this"), and the exposure decision forecloses the path of complicit silence with visible cost (legal threats, mother's grief, public censure). The journalist's arrival provides a reversal opportunity but resolves too smoothly—he simply accepts her evidence without resistance. Clara's agency drives the turn, though the overnight research montage skips potential complications (missing documents, ambiguous evidence) that would have deepened pressure. One meaningful tightening with felt cost present, but the escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (silence the firmware's dissonance) is signaled at the halfway mark via Elara's exposition. One tightening occurs when Lira kneels and reads the letters, but the escalation is expositional rather than tactical—no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The baby's cries "soften" off-camera; the firmware rewrites itself mechanically. Agency is passive reception (Althea's voice guides, the lab groans externally) rather than a protagonist choice that narrows options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (decode the grotto's message) is signaled early and Mara's choice to draw the mandala tightens options. Yet escalation is muted—no credible opposition or trade-off forces a high-stakes decision. The tile's directive ("Interject") and the mandala's autonomous rearrangement externalize agency; Mara observes more than she risks. The closure image (holographic vortex, bell tolling) suggests resolution by discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—symbolic rebirth of the plaza—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elias encounters no friction: no competing focalizer, no physical obstacle, no internal hesitation that costs him something else. The tessera placement is a unilateral act; pressure does not escalate because nothing resists or narrows his options. The resolution is gestural rather than earned by a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—mend the fractured timeline by luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification occurs when the coin reverses and Elias hums louder, thickening the tapestry. However, no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid; Elias succeeds by escalating effort (humming louder, dancing) without sacrificing a competing want or enduring a dramatized loss. The resolution delivers the encore he seeks with no on-page cost that the reader can locate in a sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias seeks an alternative to the recall pills. One meaningful tightening occurs when he traces the "silver thread" and the geode flares, but this moment deepens understanding without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options—it confirms his hypothesis rather than testing it against a genuine obstacle. Mara's question "And if it doesn't work?" hints at risk, yet Elias's reply ("Then we keep trying") sidesteps visible cost. The pills remain off-stage threat rather than on-page pressure; no antagonist or secondary character applies friction that alters Elias's tactics before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to become the voice of the unknown"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The story presents a single tightening: the fossil floats and dissolves, granting Lira insight. No prior option is foreclosed; luck (the fossil's mystical properties) delivers the transformation rather than Lira's agency under pressure. The heat-mapper colors and spore absorption read as spectacle rather than earned escalation. Cost is not legible on the page—Lira packs her tools and leaves, unchanged in circumstance or visible sacrifice. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the fossil's memory-vision), but it does not narrow options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—spinning prophecy into possibility—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara encounters no obstacle (the jar is found, the echo is heard, the wisdom is received). The button-sorting is framed as method but does not escalate pressure or force a trade-off. The ending restates her prior belief without demonstrating a visible price paid or a path foreclosed. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming courage to pursue her father's truth) is signaled early. The transcription deepens her resolve, and the closing decision to continue toward the weather station provides one tightening. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible price—she kneels, transcribes, and departs without friction. The wind-creak false alarm deflates rather than escalates pressure, and agency remains contemplative rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=2.9)
    No dominant stake is dramatized with on-page pressure. Thaddeus waits, boards, crosses, and disembarks without opposition, narrowing options, or trade-offs. The "palimpsest promise" and his gift to "distill complexity" are thematic declarations never tested by conflict. No reversal or tightening occurs; coincidence (the ferry's arrival) advances the plot without protagonist agency. The ferryman's silence and the ticking gutters supply atmosphere but no escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the oasis resists entropy—is signaled early and sustained. The lantern glass thrums and the vision arrives as a tightening moment, but these are largely passive revelations rather than protagonist choices that narrow options. Mara kneels, places the glass, traces sunlight, and receives insight; her agency is observational. The story lacks a second on-page reversal or a moment where Mara must trade one path for another with visible cost. The ending "her work here was done" implies resolution, but we do not see what she sacrificed or what competing desire she renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's mission to bring beauty and light to dark corners—is signaled early. The visit to Mara provides one tightening: his decision to try again after the geranium. However, the escalation is modest; Mara's hesitation dissolves in a single beat without forcing a trade-off or visible price. The window-opening moment reweights the space but doesn't foreclose a path or demonstrate cost—it reads as symbolic resolution rather than a choice that alters tactics or narrows options. Agency is present but the final act lacks the friction or loss that would charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial glows and Lirael speaks aloud, narrowing her options from passive observation to active stance. Yet the escalation relies on environmental response (the hum shifts, the library changes) rather than protagonist agency under pressure; coincidence supplies the tools and chambers without Lirael paying a visible on-page price or making a trade-off that forecloses a path. The cost remains felt but not dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lila's desire to "rejoin" and find connection—is signaled in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she writes her secret and places it in the orb, which narrows her stance from observer to participant. Under the Accumulative lens, this shift constitutes a single tightening that reweights her professional detachment. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; she plans to return to her clients with a new approach, but no on-page consequence (lost income, severed relationship, professional risk) makes the trade-off tangible. The cost remains conceptual rather than felt, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—stop the tricksters' influence before the board cuts funding—is signaled early. The subsonic-frequency gambit provides one meaningful tightening when the transmitter whines and constellations shift. Yet the escalation lacks felt cost: the board reverses its decision off-page, the community's division "softens" without dramatized trade-offs, and Lila's success arrives without visible sacrifice or a narrowed path. The tricksters' note introduces future stakes but does not reweight the present closure, leaving the first round without a legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the key) is signaled early. One reversal occurs when the corridor twists and the key flickers, forcing the compass-stab tactic, but that choice feels convenient rather than costly—the compass works because the plot requires it. The cathedral's "shuddering" after he takes the key hints at consequence but dissolves into the gateway moment without on-page cost or tightened options. No visible trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (solving the cold case via empathic insight) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the handprint and locket surface, narrowing the victim's identity and motive. However, Clara's role is largely interpretive—she sketches and explains while Voss excavates physical evidence. The resolution (reopening the case) is Voss's procedural decision, not Clara's choice under competing pressures, and no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving the exile was reversible—is signaled early and remains coherent. Clara's archive search and digging provide one meaningful tightening when she finds the journal. However, the escalation lacks agency-driven cost: the director's evacuation warning is ignored without consequence, and the final act (reading aloud) feels coincidental rather than a choice that forecloses options. No visible price is paid on the page, keeping pressure legible but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hitchhiker's secret—is signaled but never tightens into a choice with cost. Elias's agency is passive observation until the final fiddle-playing, which resolves everything via unexplained magic. No visible price, no foreclosed path: the "pixelated amnesty" grants him a new realm without sacrifice. The escalation (playing faster, pixels swirling) reads as special-effect description rather than meaningful pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to understand cyclical paths and dissuade the founders—is signaled early but remains abstract. The "dissuasion" unfolds off-page (Marcus grows restless, founders argue) without on-page confrontation or reversal that tests Elias's agency. The one tightening is conceptual: Elias realizes choices drive cycles, not fate. However, this insight arrives via reflection rather than pressure; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The startup's collapse is a parallel illustration, not a consequence of Elias's intervention, and his success (founders shaken, trust frayed) is summarized rather than dramatized. Agency is decision (placing bills) but the trade-off or price is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to understand her brother's fate—is signaled early and maintained. Veyra's arrival provides new information (temple rewrites daily, shared burdens) but does not narrow Lirael's options; she simply nods and proceeds. The hologram entry could serve as escalation, but no live cost or tactical constraint emerges: the whispers "wash over her" without resistance, and the glyphs stabilize immediately. The resolution grants her a lullaby in her brother's handwriting without requiring a visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering hidden truth beneath the surface—is signaled early and pursued on the page. Pressure coheres through vortex entry, seed release, and vision reception, but escalation is gentle: no reversal tightens options, no live cost forces a trade between safety and revelation. Mira's agency is limited to patience and breath control; the seed and spores do the causal work, and the vortex "seemed to laugh" then slows on its own. The ritual-failure inciting event promises complications but never resurfaces as obstacle. One meaningful deepening occurs (vision shifts from "blood-stained hands" to "self-defense"), yet it lands as clarification rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (mend the eclipsed covenant) is signaled early. Pressure attempts to escalate through visions and the confrontation with the golden-eyed self, but Lirael's agency is reactive—she follows the clipping's pull and accepts the figure's wisdom without a visible on-page choice that narrows options. The climax compresses into "pressed it to her heart, and the world split open," bypassing a decision beat where cost would be legible. No forfeiture or trade-off appears; the covenant mends and she gains glowing scars, suggesting resolution without price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—patching the holes in her soul—is signaled early and pursued. However, the escalation is guided entirely by the keeper's instructions rather than Lirael's agency narrowing options. The fruit-eating provides a vision-summary of lessons learned, but the trade-off (giving the Fool card) feels lightweight and resolved off-stage. One tightening occurs (the sewing ritual), but the cost at closure is told through metaphor rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after failure—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the phoenix logo is discovered, narrowing Lenny's understanding and raising emotional investment. However, escalation is passive: Google provides answers, the bassist confirms, and Lenny's epiphany arrives without forfeiting a live option or paying a visible price. The phone call resolves rather than complicates. Gus's "toss it" creates brief tension but Lenny's refusal costs nothing on the page. No trade-off or foreclosed path makes the cost legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing the arbor's connection—is signaled early. Elara's placement of the seed and chanting constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows options under the Accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks visible friction: no setback complicates her ritual, and the arbor responds immediately without resistance. The "haunted ambitions" remain abstract; no on-page cost or trade-off sharpens the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through identity transformation—is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page obstacle. The woman's hesitation ("routine is a cage") dissolves instantly without escalation or trade-off. The librarian guides but does not face pressure; the child's starfish smelting at the end loops back without raising cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (visitors arrive) drives movement rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"dissolve the walls between hearts"—is declared but never tested. Elias faces no dilemma, sacrifice, or failure; he simply follows the glow and places the pearl. The "tremor in the energy grid" inciting incident evaporates without consequence, and the resolution (farmer's radio, scientist's serum, child's door) occurs off-page to others. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or turn is required; none appears—pressure remains static from summoning to spiral to epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a path to self-forgiveness—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through graffiti messages that reframe her quest, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The turn from mapping rivers to mapping her heart is an internal realization, not a decision with visible cost. The accordion-playing deepens mood but does not alter tactics. Escalation reads as thematic layering rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (find the library) is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout—Lira investigates without meaningful obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The watch guides her, the pattern emerges on cue, and the book appears when she pulls it; no tightening narrows options or forces a cost. The resolution is arrival-by-persistence rather than protagonist agency under escalating pressure. One deepening (plotting delays to find the pattern) provides modest escalation, but the ending delivers discovery without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to seize the throne via the violin's music—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is declarative rather than dramatized: the violin's strings snap "one by one, each break a note of resolution" without showing Lira's hand in the act or the tactical cost of that moment. The two futures (throne vs. garden) are presented as alternatives rather than choices forged under pressure. The ending forecloses the throne path with felt cost (the ache remains), qualifying as closure, but the tightening lacks agency-driven turns.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving Elion's echo before dissolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. The pool cracking provides one pressure point, but the resolution (moonlight vial, lullaby) does not narrow options or force visible sacrifice. The "unconventional" embellishment reads as added skill rather than a desperate trade-off. One tightening occurs, but without felt cost the escalation remains mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment's source—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live decision on the page forces a trade-off or forecloses an option. Elara's return and hairpin restoration happen to Lirael rather than through her agency. The shell discovery offers intrigue but doesn't escalate pressure; the sister's herbal basket arrival and merchant's guilt resolve tension externally. One deepening occurs (Lirael's recognition of choice as the cycle's thread), but visible cost at closure is missing—she ends peaceful without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: Mira's need to interpret her husband's "haunting" (guilt vs. message). The cloak scene provides one meaningful tightening—Elias feels his convictions blur under its weight—but Mira's agency in the chime removal lacks on-page friction or visible cost. The story tells us unhooking produces clarity but does not dramatize what she risks or loses by choosing cedar+oak over the full set. Escalation is present but the resolution's price is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching vanishing—is declared but never faces on-page resistance or cost. Elara's withholding has no visible price; Lira's "desperate" questions occur in summary across weeks without a scene where she must choose between competing needs. The final "I see it" moment is cognitive, not a decision that forecloses a path. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the stone-throw recurs without escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is declared but never tested through a trade-off or reversal. Kael observes birds, feels the pulse, and concludes alignment is the answer; no live option is narrowed, no price paid on the page. The figure-eight pattern serves as confirmation rather than complication, and the morning descent enacts the insight without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple after magic felt hollow—is signaled early and persists through the arc. However, escalation is shallow: Kael encounters no genuine opposition, and the keystone's transformation sequence unfolds without narrowing his options or forcing a trade-off. The climax (pouring starlight, transforming the garden) is enacted through external magic rather than a difficult choice with visible cost. One tightening occurs when he decides to recreate his mother's garden, but the spire accommodates him without resistance, so pressure does not cohere into a moment where agency forecloses a live alternative. No persistent constraint shapes his tactics; he succeeds at each attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering the color of sound to process Lila's death) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the physical descent and the library discovery; the humming book and swirling light deepen the thematic question. Agency at closure is limited: Elias places the key tag and whispers insight, but the act is acceptance rather than a choice that narrows tactical options or exacts visible cost. The water parting and lanterns winking out supply atmospheric closure but do not constitute a turn driven by protagonist decision under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding the prophecy to align with purpose) is present, but escalation is thin. Kael adjusts dials, arranges coins, and watches holograms coalesce without encountering a reversal or obstacle that narrows his options. The "static bursts" challenge is resolved through patient observation and a cognitive shift ("The static bursts made sense now") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The cost of alignment—what Kael must give up or endure—is told ("his hands trembled") but not demonstrated through a decision with visible consequence. Pressure accumulates atmospherically but does not tighten causally.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and pursued through the prism ritual. The whispers escalate from faint to "dissonant hum" to a single clear phrase, a tightening consistent with Accumulative lens. Yet the resolution is passive: the monsters "dissolved into mist" with no on-page cost to Elias's agency. He repeats their phrase and they vanish; luck or atmospheric magic resolves the conflict rather than his sacrifice or renunciation. The final paragraph asserts readiness but shows no forfeited path or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: fix the bell to heal the cosmic rift. Pressure tightens as Elias adjusts drip rate across hours, with the bell's cracks widening and his hands shaking from exhaustion. The synchronization moment narrows options and delivers a tangible outcome. Cost is visible (physical collapse, fragile solution requiring constant adjustment) but the "last fish caught" arriving precisely at success feels coincidental rather than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue hoarding memory privately or share it—is signaled through Mara's tin of photographs and her stated method of "expunging ghosts." The appearance of Elias's daughter and her challenge ("memories need a guardian... Now you need to be something else") applies pressure, and Mara's choice to add her own photo and walk together is a meaningful tightening with relational cost. However, the escalation feels somewhat externally delivered; Mara doesn't actively resist or wrestle with the shift in the encounter itself, which would have raised the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition before the final transformation—is signaled early but never tightens into a choice with visible cost. The starling observation and pattern-tracing sequence read as procedural steps rather than escalating pressure; Elara faces no reversal, no failed attempt, no forced trade-off. The hand-in-flame moment ("Pain sharpened her focus") hints at sacrifice but immediately converts to insight without altering later tactics or foreclosing an option. One tightening or deepening with cost would lift this into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent arbor unraveling—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: first node repair reveals another disrupted node, narrowing his window. Agency is present but lightweight; Kael's competence means no trade-off or visible forfeit shapes the climax. The resolution (patterns stabilized, arbor safe "for now") lands cleanly but the cost reads as acceptance of duty rather than a hard choice that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—custody of the brain/existence—is signaled early but remains abstract. The clone's challenge ("You're obsolete") and Kael's energy-channeling response lack a visible trade-off or cost until the explosion. The "complementary opposites" method is invoked but not dramatized as a constraint that narrows options; Kael simply "presses harder" and wins. The ending declares victory ("whole and unbroken") without showing what Kael sacrificed or risked to achieve the merge, flattening the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation proceeds in a linear accumulation: machine sputters, faint shimmer, child's laugh, stronger echoes, burst of light. Yet the process lacks a reversal or tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off; Marlowe's refusal to stop is stated ("Still, he refused to stop") rather than dramatized through a moment where continuing costs him something specific on the page. The ending's success feels preordained, and the "exhausting" toll is described but does not visibly alter his tactics or force a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Mara's oath to guard this reality vs. her dimensional homesickness and the pendant's mystery. The cultist's arrival and Mara's choice to discard the pendant (rather than return or yield it) constitute one meaningful tightening that forecloses negotiation. However, the escalation is undercut by unclear causality: the pendant's discard seems to unlock the door, yet the cultist's plea ("give me the key") implied the opposite. The cost—cultist screaming, Mara vanishing—is visible but consequences remain off-page; the reunion with her mentor resolves homesickness too neatly without on-page friction or trade-off in the ending beat. Mara's agency drives the turn, but the mechanics don't compel inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the crozier to interrupt stifling destiny—is signaled early and tightens through successive approximation (spiral→web→cage for light) until the final choice: pour his own essence or remain paralyzed. That choice forecloses passivity with visible cost (scars, frayed mind, freed but altered). The nexus's physical responses (shudder, roar, ash swirling) escalate pressure cohesively under the Causal lens, and the price is legible on the page in the penultimate and final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the beginning in every ending via the hush—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when Kael dismantles the console, but no live option is foreclosed; the tower's resistance collapses in a single beat without trade-off. The lunar perigee timeframe is mentioned but never tightens tactics or creates urgency. Closure shows transformation (tower reborn, river revealed) but Kael's agency is observational; he witnesses rebirth rather than choosing between competing goods with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—merging timelines to complete the passengers' journeys—is signaled early and tightens when Kael tunes the radio to match the grotto's pulsations. The grotto shudders, the ferry lurches sideways, and the passengers materialize: one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, Kael's agency is passive observation followed by a single broadcast decision with no visible trade-off; the hourglass shatters in his hand without prior cost, and the passengers' merge feels coincidental rather than driven by his sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving "logic and magic could coexist"—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option. The thread's eruption is a spectacle without agency cost; Clara closes her eyes and the gallery changes around her. The curator's voice provides the turn ("You've discovered it"), substituting declaration for dramatized escalation. One tightening occurs (weaving accelerates, mirrors shatter), but no visible price alters her later tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—Lirael's desire to navigate by starlight for herself—is signaled in paragraph four but remains abstract throughout. The lesson at the city's edge introduces a spatial move but no reversal or tightening; Tarel's question deflates immediately with Lirael's reassuring answer. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with legible cost; the resolution ("learning to navigate by starlight herself") is told, not earned by protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—assuring the woman of her partner's love—is signaled early but remains abstract; no moment dramatizes what Lila risks or loses if she fails. The pulse intensifies as she moves deeper, yet this is atmospheric rather than a narrowing of options. The man's appearance and message arrive without Lila making a hard choice between competing goods; she executes her professional role smoothly. The ending delivers satisfaction without visible cost or tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving her brother existed beyond the bubble—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The tide's turn supplies one clear tightening that forces Lira to act (water rising from ankles to waist), and her slapping the gold fleck onto the terminal is protagonist-driven agency. The escalation is functional but narrow: external pressure (flooding) rather than internal contradiction drives the peak choice. Cost is present but muted—she emerges with proof but the price (claustrophobia endured, facility collapsing) doesn't visibly foreclose a path or exact a trade-off that reweights her later options.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's struggle to reconcile the death-certificate error and claim agency—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure does not escalate through causal tightening; instead, the story loops through description of the ink, the shard, and OBS-7's prompts without a reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The final defragmentation is announced ("Defragmenting," he said) rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost; we don't see what Elias risks or loses by letting the error linger. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency is dilute—Elias observes, traces, and declares without a decision that forecloses a live path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—translate the diamond's curse into resonance—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the echoes roar back, forcing the throw. However, the protagonist's agency is reactive: the canyon "demands payment" and the diamond "burns," compelling the decision rather than protagonist-driven choice under pressure. The "I am the extinction!" shout declares a stance without prior on-page cost narrowing options. The resolution avoids the problem (she discards the gem) rather than transforming it, and her steady hands undercut felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—document the cryptid versus succumb to transformation—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the arrowhead pulses and Elara lifts the phone, narrowing her options. But the climax reversal (metamorphosis) is triggered by herbalist instruction and arrowhead "surge" rather than Elara's trade-off under competing goods. The cost (shedding researcher identity) is told in the final paragraph without visible price paid on the page, and her human memories "fight back" then vanish without friction or consequence shown.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: reawaken the orchard's wild magic. The crack in the statue's knee tightens options once, and Lira's sustained playing escalates pressure until the string snaps—but the geyser and statue collapse feel externally granted rather than forced by her tactical choices. The snapped string is a visible cost, yet she switches to the shell without narrative friction or a new tradeoff, so the price doesn't narrow later options. Coincidence (the geyser erupting, statues crumbling on cue) resolves rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient at this length, but the escalation reads linear (more music → bigger effects) without a reversal or choice that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled: foster connections across the border gap. The release of the storm is one meaningful tightening that narrows options (he commits the contraband act). However, escalation lacks a visible trade-off or second reversal; soldiers lower guns, machines glow, but no on-page consequence or cost alters Elias's later tactics—he simply collects his mailbag "ready for the next drop." The storm complicates (soldiers freeze in awe) but does not create a dramatized price or foreclosed path for Elias himself. Agency is present (he chooses to send the bottle) but the result is atmospheric rather than a stakes-narrowing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—finding beauty in silence—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. Elio encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and faces no moment where his belief risks failure. The halo fragment's discovery and the courtyard's transformation unfold as confirmations rather than reversals. No on-page tightening narrows options or deepens cost; the wind bells and singing are atmospheric rather than stakes-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live"—is signaled early and drives Eleanor's midnight ritual, but the escalation is smooth rather than pressured. No live option is tested or foreclosed; the circular room appears as a reward without prior obstacle or tactical trade-off. The young patron's skepticism softens instantly without resistance, and the final "transformation" of patrons lingering longer lacks a visible cost tied to Eleanor's earlier restlessness. One tightening (the midnight chime and shimmer) is present but does not narrow options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (capture the runaway dream) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when colors refuse to blend, forcing feverish work. But the resolution is handed to Elara by the dream's agency ("I've been chasing you"), not her choice—coincidence resolves rather than complicates. No visible trade-off: she gains fulfillment without losing the practice, the palette, or a competing desire. The price is told ("no longer needed to paint") but not felt; we don't see her lay down the brush or face an irrevocable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to free an idea trapped behind fear"—is declared but never tested by a live dilemma or visible cost. Elias's opening of the locket proceeds without obstacle or trade-off; the "disorientation" that follows is environmental effect, not a consequence of his choice. No on-page reversal narrows his options; the woman's whispers arrive as exposition rather than a pressure that forces a decision. The ending offers transformation by transport rather than earned agency with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early but remains abstract until the locket reveal. The tightening from dream clue to constellation mapping to locket discovery is more puzzle-solution than escalating pressure with visible trade-offs. No live option is foreclosed: Elias could leave but chooses to wait, a decision without dramatized cost (no missed obligation, no physical peril paid on the page). Coincidence (the locket perfectly placed under the mushroom cap) resolves rather than complicates, and the ending grants understanding without demanding sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching the visitor how to reverse her village's exile—is signaled but escalation is minimal: Lirael pours tea, annotates leaves, and offers metaphorical counsel without on-page friction or tightening. The visitor arrives with a problem and departs with resolve, but no reversal or narrowing of options occurs on the page. The "walk backwards" directive is delivered as wisdom rather than tested in scene, and Lirael's own restlessness ("the exile might soon reverse itself") is mentioned but not dramatized. Closure hinges on the visitor's off-page future action, not a protagonist-driven turn with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake (preserve wonder's color) is signaled early and persists. The ritual escalates through clear steps—climb, cut, incantation, seed throw—but each move succeeds without trade-off or visible price. No live option is foreclosed; the seed's absence is immediately replaced by the blossom, softening consequence. The waterfall's dissonance resolves into joy, flattening tension rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the fisherman's restless spirit by unraveling the net—is clear and tightens once through Mara's needle-work. The net gives way in a burst of light, altering the situation. Cost is implied (the hush's weight lifts) but not viscerally felt; Mara's admission "I'm afraid" and her unsteady legs are brief gestures. The fisherman's secret is revealed by Elias in exposition rather than tested against Mara's own choices, weakening agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: unlock the henge's silence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the film comparison reveals shifted carvings, narrowing Elias's hypothesis. The stone-ear-hum-water sequence is a single escalation beat with visible agency (he acts on the sextant alignment and holy water). Closure reconfigures the chapel from barrier to bridge, but the move feels more conceptual discovery than forced trade-off—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid (he simply "understood"). Situational pressure is coherent but does not compel a high-cost choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding how memories persist and dissolve—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative discovery: white noise loop, 440 Hz match, realization of quantum communication experiment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara grasps the loop as deliberate signal rather than glitch, reweighting "letting go" as transmission. Agency is present in her analytic choices (transcribing, cross-referencing, isolating pattern), and the final decision to replay and map the hum to a decay rate forecloses the simpler path of solving Earhart's disappearance. Cost is visible in her shift from public findings to private resonance work. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase that reweights the stake; one tightening is sufficient for this length. Pressure coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs through encoded messages—is signaled early but never tested. Elias completes each message without obstacle, misunderstanding, or internal conflict; the ghost does not answer, and no consequence follows. The storm complicates atmosphere but does not narrow his options or force a trade-off. The flower press slip is a micro-beat, not a reversal. The ending offers a moment of poise (walking away, the ghost smiling) but no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the captain's death and the widow's grief—is signaled early and tightens when Mara finds the diary and goggles. The reversal (captain chose this end, lured beyond the veil) narrows Mara's options to either surrender the artifacts or keep searching. The widow's cracking detachment and Mara's decision to step onto the tenth floor with the tools in hand provide a visible tightening with felt cost, though the price could be more explicitly foregrounded in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that empty spaces remember—is signaled early and motivates the telescope work, but on-page escalation is limited. The string snaps, the gondola drifts, the tower vanishes; these are atmospheric complications rather than choices that narrow Lila's options or force trade-offs. The nimbus observation ("fractals of rage") and the void's pulse are textural deepening, not reversals driven by protagonist agency. A single meaningful tightening is present (the tower vanishing, the void's charge), but no visible cost lands that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the guild's legacy versus documenting decay—is signaled early and tightens when the panel opens. One meaningful deepening: discovering the journal reweights her commission from elegy to active guardianship. The wrecking ball's first blow forces the choice to take the safe, though the decision feels hurried rather than agonized. Cost is present but muted: she walks away, but we don't see pursuit, guilt, or tangible forfeit on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens is adequate; under Causal it would need sharper trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—charting the next great discovery—is signaled early and Lira pursues it through decoding the hopscotch board and leaping into the void. One meaningful tightening occurs when the starlings part to reveal the gap, narrowing her options to act or retreat. Yet the leap itself is unopposed: no fear, no cost calculation on the page, no visible forfeit (stamina, safety margin, captain's trust dramatized as a tactical constraint afterward). The stranded luminance puzzle drives her forward, but its resolution (touching the orb, receiving visions) is a reward without resistance or trade-off, deflating escalation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—find the clockmaker's gear assortment—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the false-reflection mirror is identified, narrowing options. However, agency is limited: Kael executes a prepared plan (the vial) without adaptation or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The lock springs open without complication, and the resolution is comfort rather than cost. Escalation under the Causal lens is present but minimal, and the ending declares readiness rather than demonstrating a change in capacity or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (save the arches to preserve the nebula) is signaled early but never tightens through agency or reversal; Elara's plan unfolds without friction, and the settlers' mobilization is summarized rather than dramatized. No on-page moment forces a trade-off or forecloses an option—doubt "gave way to determination" off-stage, and the climax compresses hours of work into generic description ("reinforced," "secured," "chanted"). Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist decision; the nebula "flared to life" as a declarative result, not a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (vouchsafe the final ripple of time/ensure a gentle end) is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the puppet is a map and when she must accept her flaws to sing. The final act—singing despite doubt—narrows options (the pane cracks, irreversibly) and pays a visible price (puppet shatters, lighthouse groans). Agency is clear: Mara's choice to sing drives the resolution. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes "the broken puppet head wasn't a failure. It was a map," reweighting her task and enabling the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (guide traveler to safety or suffer the curse) is signaled early and drives every move. Pressure tightens when the birds dive lower and the traveler's whimper grows louder, forcing Kael to act despite risk. The door discovery and subsequent slam constitute one meaningful reversal that narrows options. The cost is felt (the curse satisfied temporarily, the labyrinth will reset) and the resolution is earned by Kael's agency. No second reversal, but one clean escalation suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with Mara—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test. The text from Mara arrives without Elara having to choose between competing fears or wants; she simply types back. No reversal tightens options: the ravine insight flows directly into acceptance with no resistance. The chrysalis release and polymer design shift occur in summary weeks later, erasing immediacy. Agency is minimal—events happen to Elara (she finds the chrysalis, receives the text) rather than forcing her to act under conflicting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for where stories begin—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by a concrete on-page dilemma. The man's request introduces a complication, yet his departure lacks friction or cost to Elara; she watches and wonders but does not act or renounce. The floating note's return suggests a tightening, but it arrives as external validation rather than a choice-driven reversal. No visible price is paid (time, resource, relationship) that alters later tactics. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate to a moment where Elara must choose between competing goods or endure a foreclosed path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—tempering stored remorse—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Nessar submerges deeper, the memory surges, and he gasps under the founder's guilt, then the pool goes still. This is one meaningful deepening with felt cost (unsteady legs, numbed fingers, subsumption of guilt). The guard's retreat and the pavilion's contagion are pressures present but not tested through reversal. Agency at closure is renunciation/endurance (spreading the burden), fitting the Accumulative lens. Solid execution; no second reversal is required, but the cost legibility is asserted ("felt lighter") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture, keeping the score at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging the silence between village and scholars—is declared early but never dramatized through resistance or cost. Elara works alone; no villager interrupts, no gear resists beyond inertness, and the weight's "faint glow" signals success without a visible trade-off. The midnight chime and villagers' gathering constitute a reversal in social state, but it arrives without prior escalation or a decision that forecloses another path. The piece accumulates atmosphere and thematic claims but does not tighten options or force a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the mirror to entangle memories—is signaled early and pursued linearly. The headband feedback loop introduces a complication: "his own memories bleeding into the mirror's" and "the canyon seemed to swallow him whole." Yet this reversal is resolved within two sentences by "adjusting the headband's dials with chaotically precise movements," offering no visible trade-off or cost that alters later tactics. The ending declares success without showing what path was foreclosed or what price Kael paid beyond temporary discomfort. One tightening moment exists (feedback threat) but lacks the cost clarity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the seeds of vigilance—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens around a live choice. Lira encounters the manuscript, the gravity flip, and the keys in sequence; none forces a renunciation or trade-off. The fifty-seven-minute clock is mentioned but never dramatized as a constraint that alters her tactics. The ending declares transformation ("keeper of thresholds") without showing what path she foreclosed or what cost she paid to cross that threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to make the silent world sing—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara learns to "listen not with her ears but with her bones," and the porcelain's shattering marks a micro turn. However, the escalation is largely textural (repetition of strumming over days) rather than a tightening of options or a visible tradeoff. No live alternative path is foreclosed with felt cost; the resolution arrives as success without meaningful renunciation or price paid in the climactic moment. The epilogue's "years later" summary dilutes closure pressure rather than amplifying it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—correlating the stone's secrets with the covenant before the eclipse—is signaled early and tightens through three beats: placing the stone, feeling the silence, and translating the glow into the star-map/chessboard. Alaric's agency is clear in each step (kneeling, pressing his palm, inserting the key). The chess metaphor (queen's diagonal through the Shattered Sword) provides a meaningful deepening that narrows his interpretive options. Cost is felt (tears, the weight of forgotten oaths) but the resolution depends heavily on the stone and mage cooperating; Alaric's final choice to plant the seed is confirmatory rather than a forced trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the diary to understand her grandmother—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the firework forces her to persist through distraction, and the lock clicks. Yet the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost of "carrying silences forward" remains abstract rather than a visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—cultivating the corpse flower to harmonize the village—is signaled early and sustained. The elders' dismissal provides external pressure, and Lira's internal shift from forcing growth to embracing stillness is a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation is thin: the seed's dormancy is a passive obstacle, and the dream-delivered insight bypasses on-page struggle. The bloom resolves the conflict without visible tradeoff; Lira loses no credible alternative path, and the village's acceptance arrives too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—discover the source of resilience—is signaled early. The gravity inversion functions as a ticking clock, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Lira reaches the cavern, inserts the tip, and the answer is given to her. The pedestal socket is a perfect fit with no cost, complication, or choice between competing goods. Agency at closure is reception rather than decision, and the shift to "guard the gathering" lacks dramatized price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—documenting wind patterns to explain the crash—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the gust knocks Anya off balance and the tablet flashes a warning, forcing her to climb. However, the engineer's presence atop the container is coincidental rather than earned by Anya's tactical choices, and the final descent lacks visible cost; she simply climbs down with her documentation intact. One meaningful tightening occurs (the wind spike and climb), but the resolution does not foreclose a path with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder essential by unfettering the cavern's voice—is signaled early. Lira sings, the ice responds, Veyra is converted, and the mission succeeds without visible friction or cost. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the aurora and amber sheet cooperate seamlessly, and the sculptor's skepticism evaporates in a single beat. The ending celebrates harmony without demonstrating what was risked or renounced to achieve it, leaving escalation shallow and closure cost implicit at best.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—master the flute's true purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the specter says "unmake" and the chamber forces Kael to face shadow-selves. Agency at closure is present (he retrieves fragments, etches new rune) but reads as acceptance rather than a choice that narrows options or pays visible cost. The flute's breaking feels accidental (it slips), not a protagonist-driven reversal. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the lesson arrives via exposition ("the flute's power lies…in its silence") rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving emotions are solvable equations—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragment flares and merges Elias's detachment with Veyra's heart, forcing him to inhabit emotions rather than observe them. However, the escalation is artifact-driven: the fragment "lowers its guard" and then "transposes their empathy" without clear cost or tactical adjustment from Elias. His reaching for the fragment and its settling "cool and obedient" resolves the conflict through submission of the object, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: Kail must understand and fulfill his mentor's cryptic lessons, signaled early through his nervousness and Veyra's echoing voice. Pressure accumulates through the pendant's intensifying vibration and the woman's mysterious directive. The planting action narrows options—Kail moves from questioning courier to committed participant. Visible cost: the pendant stills, suggesting his courier role ends. One friction: the woman's appearance feels coincidental, and Kail's compliance lacks the visible internal trade-off that would push this higher; he hesitates for one beat then proceeds without dramatized consequences of refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving her theory to validate herself against her mentor—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's method escalates pressure: prism glows, arbor pulses, frost shatters. Yet the shattering glass acts as external accident rather than a consequence of her prior choices, and her response is passive realization ("I need clarity" → epiphany) rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No visible cost alters her tactics; she tucks the prism away and finds peace. The stakes remain abstract throughout, never tested by a trade-off or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring song to the silenced world—is signaled early and Mara's agency drives the key turn: fitting the final puzzle piece triggers the beads' merger and the orchard's song. The cost of releasing her grandmother's bead forecloses her direct inheritance and stills her loom, a visible trade-off. However, the middle escalation (weeks of puzzle-solving) is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the sense of narrowing options. The crow's theft offers a complication but resolves off-page. Under the Accumulative lens, the single decisive intensification (puzzle completion → bead fusion → sacrifice) meets the length's requirement, though one on-page failed attempt would sharpen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (Veyra's decay) is signaled early and sustained. Jorin's descent and Lira's challenge constitute one meaningful tightening. The shard-strike ordeal raises intensity, but the resolution—orb absorbed, planet healed—arrives without visible trade-off; Jorin emerges physically marked yet unchanged in options or stance. Cost is bodily (blood drawn) but does not foreclose a path or alter later tactics, keeping escalation functional but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering the truth about his mother's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when the woman confirms the shard is "a choice." Kael's agency drives escalation: he climbs the platform despite caution, demands "Show me," then chooses to throw the shard, forfeiting further pursuit. The cost is legible on the page: "the shard gone," "trembled," and the acknowledgment he's learned "to let it go." One clear reversal—the woman's refusal to simply explain shifts Kael from seeker to renouncer. No coincidence resolves; the portal responds to his action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving safety and connection when the lamp fails—is signaled early and tightens as Elias moves from dismissal to participation in the chain. The stone-stacking and sea glass placement are micro-choices that narrow his isolation, and the final gesture ("placed the final stone") crystallizes his shift with the cost of accepting fragility over certainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "the letters, the stones, the sea glass—they were a way to protect that feeling, to bottle it." Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the stakes remain largely internal; no external antagonist tests his commitment, keeping tension at mid-high rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"to see the dawn" and "shape the future"—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page reversal. She adjusts the wick, the shadows respond obediently, and the gold dawn appears; no complication forces a trade-off. The "darkness too" flicker is acknowledged then set aside without cost. Agency is reduced to observation and declaration ("Let's do this") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the pressure remains flat from midpoint to end.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and shapes Lin's tracking. The middle tightening occurs when the wing's light leads her to the travelers, and pressure peaks when the wing flares and vanishes. However, the escalation relies on the wing's autonomous movement rather than Lin's agency under competing constraints. The travelers' story reaches climax simultaneously, but Lin remains observer; no visible trade-off or foreclosed option anchors her final commitment. Pressure is coherent but the cost at closure is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what the trees witness by mapping the labyrinth's sorrow—is signaled but never tightens into a choice that forecloses an option. Elias works methodically without opposition or reversal; the wall becomes transparent, the trees yield their memories, and the storm fades without cost. The piece lacks a moment where escalation narrows Elias's options or forces a trade-off, leaving pressure coherent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The piece offers one pressure point: Lira discovers the child's melody and uses it to ignite the fruit. However, this unfolds as smooth execution rather than escalation—no option narrows, no tactic shifts, no visible trade-off. The ending tells us the work will "take time" and memories are "fragile," but no cost manifests on the page. Agency is present (she hums, she moves tree to tree) but the realm's response is assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding wisdom to reconcile grief—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the sequence (invitation → map → mirrors → key → letters), and Eleanor's choice to stay represents a micro-decision. Yet the escalation is more spatial than volitional; Eleanor follows instructions rather than making trade-offs that narrow live options. The mirrors deepen her self-awareness, but no on-page reversal forces her to renounce a path or pay a felt cost. The ending gesture (staying, cradling letters) is tender but does not foreclose an alternative with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: find the sacred / resist creeping normality. One tightening: Elias moves from passive observation (bread) to active intervention (planting). The woman's validation crystallizes his stance, but this arrives via external confirmation rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No visible price paid—he gains a garden and a sense of purpose without foreclosing another path or risking social/physical cost. Agency is present (he plants daily), yet the stakes remain abstract; what does he lose if he stops? The ending deepens his commitment but doesn't test it under pressure or show a trade-off that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: decode the vows to save the library. One meaningful tightening when the first vow's final word eludes her, then a second when the warrior's vow dissolves into static. Elara's agency (sampling faster, switching slides) drives escalation under the Causal lens. The resolution—dawn arriving and illusions brightening—lacks a visible price paid by Elara; her exhaustion melts away without foreclosing a path or trading off a competing need.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—thwart the recording device sale—is clear from paragraph two. Pressure tightens through failed bribe, lost courier, overheard intel, the lisp-man's demand for the fob, and the tower sprint against a midnight deadline. The buyer's arrival and recording playback create a reversal that narrows options (device active, father's betrayal audible), forcing Lira to smash it with visible cost (market chaos, fob cracked). The escalation is coherent under a Causal lens. One friction: the buyer's late entrance and instant defeat compress the peak confrontation; we don't see Lira weigh alternatives or face a harder trade-off, which keeps the final choice from reaching maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning why people carry weather—is signaled early and pursued on-page. Pressure tightens when the compass points to the bluff itself and the taste shifts to copper, but Lira's arrival diffuses tension into explanation rather than escalating conflict. No meaningful trade-off or foreclosed option appears; Kael passively receives information. The forests' election concludes off-page, removing the promised cost from view.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: uncork suppressed creativity. The painting ritual constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens—strokes hesitant then freer, shadow-door materializes, lock clicks—but agency feels more enacted than tested. No reversal narrows options; the shadow-door opens without resistance, and the "rush of relief" arrives without visible trade-off. Cost is declared ("dam had burst") but not dramatized as a forfeiture or tactical shift. Escalation reads as ritual intensification rather than choice under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: recover mother's last words. Pressure tightens when the quill wilts, revealing the keeper's lie, and again when the keeper explains the Archive's true nature—conversations are recycled, not preserved. This deepening reweights Elara's goal from literal recovery to symbolic acceptance. However, the keeper's exposition delivers the turn rather than Elara's agency forcing discovery; she listens and reframes rather than choosing under competing costs. The final decision to "plant the seed" reconfigures her stance but feels more like thematic resolution than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible price. One meaningful tightening is present but escalation leans on revelation rather than protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through her art—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no obstacle; the fragment cooperates, the sculpture performs, visitors arrive and understand. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The melting of the fragment is a natural process, not a consequence of her agency. The final bell-strike is a demonstration, not a choice under pressure, so escalation remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (resolve inner static) is signaled early and drives the plasma-torch choice, providing one tightening. The box's fraying seals add urgency, but the magnetic storm remains ambient rather than forcing a trade-off. When the orb dissolves into Clara-7's palm, no live option is foreclosed—she reaches out, trembling, but we don't see what she risked or lost by doing so. The piece asserts fragmented wholeness at closure without showing the price paid or the path refused. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not narrow options or alter tactics in a way that charges the final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (solve the mailbox mystery) is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Clara notices the locket and gathers stories, but the middle week compresses to summary, losing on-page escalation. The combination-lock insight arrives as exposition ("The locket's photograph—the woman's birth year…") rather than a dramatized discovery that narrows options. The final letters provide emotional payoff but no visible cost that alters Clara's stance or forecloses a path—she solves the mystery without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (retrieve the antidote) is signaled early. The holographic dance and dice alignment constitute a meaningful tightening in the middle. Yet the drones' defeat via "chaos of his rhythm" lacks setup and reads as convenience; Kael's dancing alone cannot credibly overload sensors without prior demonstration of the dice's interference properties. The final waltz feels performative rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid—he simply walks away with the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is signaled early and sustained. The gravity pockets flare once to complicate his descent, creating a brief tightening, but the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception: memories "wash over him" and the chamber "hums" in gratitude without requiring a choice that forecloses a path. The cost of accepting preservation instead of personal restoration is conceptually present but not dramatized on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the rose as key/bridge), yet escalation relies on revelation rather than a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy to save the haven—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, deepening choice, or visible price narrows options; the summoner performs a ritual, the wing glows, and success is declared. Coincidence (the wing's passive absorption) resolves the threat without protagonist trade-off. The "fracture" and "cosmic roar" remain abstract; no on-page tightening forces agency or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (unlocking the seal's power) is signaled early and tightens once when she reveals the century-cycle constraint. The final action (speaking the building's language) narrows options on the page, but the cost of "lying to the building" is declared rather than shown as a trade-off or visible forfeiture—no prior resource, relationship, or belief is spent. Agency at closure reads reactive (she urges, he complies) rather than protagonist-driven, and coincidence (meteor shower timing) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early, but pressure accumulates through ritual rather than opposition or escalating trade-offs. The shell-circle hum and memory surge provide one meaningful deepening (hearing her own eight-year-old voice), yet the resolution hinges on an unexplained mechanism ("resonance structures flared") rather than protagonist agency under constraint. No live option is visibly foreclosed; Lirael's walk away reads as an emotional shift without on-page cost to tactics or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—creating a treaty forgery to offer warring heirs a choice—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page opposition or reversal tests Lirael's commitment; she works alone, finishes, places the scroll, and leaves without a tightening choice or visible cost that narrows options. The "key with no apparent lock" and "calibrated treason" are asserted concepts, not pressures that force trade-offs. Under the Accumulative lens, we need a cadence shift or deepening that reweights the stake with cost; the ending recapitulates her resolve without altering it.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why some echo—is signaled early but never tightens through a reversal or choice that narrows options. The hooded figure's explanation is delivered without resistance or complication. No on-page cost alters tactics; Kael's decision to "keep singing" is a continuation, not a trade-off. The ascent provides physical escalation but not pressure escalation under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (reveal the sailor's secret to free his ghost) is signaled early but never tightened. No on-page reversal or narrowing of options occurs; Kael moves through three dreams without obstacle, cost, or adaptation. The sailor's ghost "stirs" and murmurs approval, the widow will "finally see," but these are summarized futures rather than present pressure. Coincidence does not resolve (acceptable), yet protagonist agency is absent—luck and passive reception drive the sequence. No live trade-off or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is philosophical: to decipher hidden patterns and honor unseen labor. Pressure accumulates as Kael follows the whistle, spots the firefly code, and uses the whisk to trace their rhythm—one meaningful tightening that narrows focus and deepens understanding. However, the escalation is conceptual without a visible trade-off or forfeited path; Kael's agency is observation and interpretation, not a decision that forecloses an option with on-page cost. Coincidence (the fireflies' precise rhythm) complicates but does not resolve, which is acceptable, yet the lack of a felt price or altered tactic caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—seal the stillpoint to prevent boundary collapse—is signaled by midpoint via the letters. One on-page reversal occurs when the flawless diamond appears, reframing the flawed gem as decoy. However, Mara's hesitation moment ("felt heavier now") lacks a dramatized trade-off; she places the diamond without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Agency reads as execution of a discovered solution rather than a choice under competing pressures. The environmental consequence (radiation drops) is visible but not a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding and harnessing the storm's frequencies—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through transmissions but never tightens into a forced choice or trade-off; Kael activates the mechanism without obstacle, cost, or complication. The text claims allegiance and balance but no on-page reversal tests his commitment, and the resolution (sand swirls, storm ebbs) arrives as convergence rather than earned deepening. The Accumulative lens tolerates gentler escalation, but even under that standard, no moment narrows options or reweights cost—the prophetic voice affirms rather than challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving lost songs can return—is signaled early and tested when the box shudders and plays his mother's lullaby. That moment tightens options emotionally. Yet the village sequence unfolds without friction: children cluster, an old woman recognizes a tune, coins jingle. No reversal or deepening choice narrows Elias's path. The ending restates intent ("capture more sounds tomorrow") without escalating cost or forcing a trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs, but closure lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—protecting the key from malevolent forces—is signaled early and drives the action. Elias's decision to match the key's frequency with the resonator creates one meaningful tightening. However, the ghost's reversal is coincidental rather than earned by Elias's prior choices; it accepts his explanation without a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses an option. The resolution feels more like the ghost's epiphany than Elias's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: align the viaduct's magnetic field with the moon's path to "unyoke" its power. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first attempt fails and Kael resets the filings; the moon's higher beam illuminates a node, narrowing his task. The dawn resonance shows success, but it is not a choice under pressure—Kael simply completes the work he set out to do, and no live option is foreclosed. The elders' approval and the weeks-long continuation flatten the stakes rather than sharpening them. Agency reads as patient execution rather than a decisive act with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (expose Cole's cover-up) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The discovery of classified files constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options. However, escalation is cognitive (Mara realizes Cole manipulated her) rather than enacted through on-page choice under pressure. The final beat declares intent ("She'd expose his secrets") but does not dramatize the decision's cost or trade-off. No visible price paid; no foreclosed alternative shown. The stake remains abstract ("justice") without a concrete on-page test that forces Mara to sacrifice something specific.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: evaluate the program's deeper purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clockwork heart is revealed, deepening Marcus's understanding and narrowing his options toward endorsement. However, no live trade-off or visible price is dramatized—Marcus walks away resolved without foreclosing an alternate path on the page. The piece meets minimal escalation under an Accumulative lens (density increase reweights the stake) but lacks the felt cost that would enter the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (ring the unheard bell) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the kaleidoscope sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira aligns the arrow tip with the glass, causing the workshop to shudder and unlocking the glider's surge. However, the final dive and collision feel more like execution of a revealed path than a choice under conflicting pressure; no visible trade-off or loss alters her tactics in the ending beat, and the bell's appearance is coincidental rather than earned by prior agency.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (finding Elara/exposing the cover-up) is signaled early. Escalation is present but formulaic: obstacles (Hale's lie, restricted files, encryption) are overcome in sequence without forcing difficult trade-offs. The video reveal provides new information but doesn't deepen the conflict—it simply confirms what Lira suspected. The alarm/drone arrival feels manufactured to inject urgency rather than arising from her choices. Her final act (uploading coordinates to her neural implant) happens off-page with no visible cost—we're told she's "already gone" but don't see what she sacrifices or risks in that escape.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—quelling a fear-born storm by reconstituting empathy—is signaled early and maintained. Elara's mirror-walk provides a tightening sequence (terror → love → hope) that deepens the empathy thread. Yet the storm's resolution arrives without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option: the fragment glows, the ice stills, the aurora approves. No on-page cost (stamina, risk, renunciation) alters Elara's later state. The escalation reads as accumulation without a price paid, capping the score below high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lila's choice between clinic visit and continued existence—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The rescue provides a surface reversal (she saves rather than seeks death) yet the turn isn't driven by Lila's agency; she hears a sound, follows it, and acts without visible internal conflict or cost. The "fold in patience" as "the moment when action became inevitable" is told in reflection rather than dramatized as a narrowing of options. No credible loss or trade-off (time, stamina, social credit) alters her tactics. The ending's "flicker of peace" suggests a stance shift but the price—what path she's now foreclosed—remains offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lila's creative and emotional paralysis—is signaled early and tested through Elias's intervention. One meaningful tightening occurs when she takes the letter and later articulates her fear of creating nothing meaningful. However, the escalation is gentle: Lila's shift from "I feel nothing" to a wry smile and laughter is a deepening rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is implicit (abandoning the easel, walking into rain) but not viscerally felt as a foreclosed path. Elias's philosophy nudges rather than pressures, which is character-consistent but lowers the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake ("preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested on the page—no risk of failure, no competing value, no visible price paid. The consecration proceeds without obstacle or reversal; coincidence (prophet's arrival) enables rather than complicates. "The echo is preserved" / "For now" deflates any achieved pressure. No tightening that forecloses an option; the line "remains" exactly as it was, confirming stasis without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—transmuting pain into art—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page pressure tests Lila's commitment. The piece offers micro-choices (picking up the feather, adding a sketch) but these deepen engagement without foreclosing options or imposing visible cost. The decision to return with film reads as continuation rather than a turn that narrows her path. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—to decode the pattern of growth—is signaled early and drives Elias's observations and note-taking. Pressure accumulates through the crystal's reflections and his racing thoughts, deepening his understanding in a single meaningful turn. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is gentle; no visible trade-off or foreclosed option sharpens the final choice. The urgency to testify is declared but not tested by a concrete on-page obstacle or price, keeping the cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: capturing "the sound of growing older" to prove he's not "just a ghost haunting the edges of tomorrow." The stake is signaled early and drives Elias's search and marker arrangement. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finally hears the sound and it "washes over him," but the escalation is passive—he listens rather than chooses. The resolution (drawing a bolder chalk line, smiling, walking away) lacks a visible trade-off or price; the sound arrives through persistence rather than agency-driven pressure. The phrase "that was enough" implies renunciation but doesn't show what path is foreclosed or what cost is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—stopping the clock hand to prevent catastrophe—is signaled early and escalates (hand slows, then spins faster). The ground's shaking provides external pressure. However, the pivot to "the hand measures escape" and the portal solution arrives late without prior setup, undercutting earned escalation. The protagonist's agency is present (he sings, solders, adjusts systems), but the final leap into the portal lacks visible cost; we don't see what he's leaving behind or what risk he's taking, so the closure beat doesn't land with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Elias achieving a peaceful, articulated goodbye—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias's voice joins the hymn, a micro-turn that shifts Clara from despair to connection. However, Mira faces no obstacles, adapts no tactics, and pays no visible price; the hymn works as intended without friction. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening or cadence shift that reweights cost; here the intensification is emotional (Clara's sobs, Elias's final "Rest") but the cost to Mira or the method remains abstract, not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding sealed awakenings and finding where shadows go—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the key's teeth align with the constellation, forcing a time-sensitive action. However, the escalation lacks genuine pressure; no failed attempt, no risk of loss, no choice between competing goods. Lirael's success is linear and uncontested. The resolution involves no visible price paid—she acts, the mechanism works, revelation follows without tactical sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake (unraveling the garden's secrets) is signaled early and pursued. The tooth functions as a key that Mara actively uses, and Elias's return introduces a complication. However, escalation is mild: the act of placing the teeth feels more ritualistic than a high-cost choice under pressure. The reversal (Elias revealing the tooth's true nature as "a bridge to us") shifts understanding but doesn't force Mara to sacrifice a live option with on-page consequence. The resolution—water flowing, path clearing—feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency that narrows her field of action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—creating a fireless beacon to honor her mother's lesson—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pearl balances against obsidian, yet this moment does not narrow options or force a trade-off; it confirms rather than complicates. The pearl's release is agency (sharing the light), but coincidence (clouds parting, star winking) resolves emotional closure without on-page cost. No live option is foreclosed; Elara experiences relief without sacrifice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: grafting new meaning onto grief after public exposure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lila unclasps the pendant and Elias adds moss, a concrete trade-off (risking alteration of brother's relic for new growth). Agency is clear in the planting and invitation to stay. However, escalation is gentle—Elias's orchid and affirmation don't genuinely narrow Lila's options; she was already moving toward openness. The cost is relational vulnerability rather than a harder choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to write messy, open endings—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. Clara follows the woman passively; no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The manuscript revision occurs in the study after the nexus journey, so the nexus itself supplies no causal tightening. The woman's declaration "endings aren't walls—they're doors" and the shell "glowing faintly" function as received wisdom rather than earned escalation. No visible cost alters Clara's tactics; she simply executes the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the arbor's fading magic—is signaled early and remains clear. The harvest moon arrival and Lira's performance produce immediate physical results (mushrooms, stream, creatures dancing), but these outcomes do not narrow options or impose a trade-off; the tendril collapses "spent" without costing Lira agency, stamina, or a foreclosed path. The fox's question and Lira's "always" promise continuation rather than closure, leaving the ending open without crystallizing what has been risked or lost. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not tighten causally or force a stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—sealing safekept starlight to unlock the heartbeat-map translation—is clear and tightens through the methodical arrangement, silver application, and plate activation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the plate begins to hum and then glows, changing Elias's knowledge. Yet the escalation is more procedural than pressured: no reversal, no visible tradeoff, no moment where success costs him something he values or forecloses an alternate path, keeping the pressure coherent but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the timer to preserve the harvest of echoes during the "wounded season"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through Elias's daily mapping and iterative discovery, culminating in the reassembly that succeeds. However, the climax presents no visible trade-off, renunciation, or complication; the last gear clicks into place and the device works. Under an accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, but here success arrives without a felt price or narrowed option to elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (collecting burdens, not wounds) is signaled early and tightens through escalating resistance: thorns soften easily, obsidian requires a crack "like a heart breaking," and the mother's locket remains untouched. The lamp's repeated extinguishing and the need to reorient it create tactical pressure. The final refusal of the locket is protagonist-driven with visible cost (leaving his own grief unresolved). However, the village arrival deflates tension rather than sustaining it through the final image, and the workshop storage beat feels like an epilogue that diffuses rather than charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—processing grief through carving—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Clara begins ready to carve and completes it without meaningful resistance, reversal, or deepening. The wood "resisted at first, then yielded" is the sole friction, resolved in a single sentence. No live option is foreclosed; the carving succeeds as planned. The piece offers a single move (carve → place) rather than a tightening that narrows tactics or raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Veyra negotiating with her ghost to release self-blame—is signaled early, but escalation is thin: the ghost appears, they exchange lines, she drops the wheel, and the ghost nods approval. No reversal narrows options or raises cost; the confrontation resolves through declaration rather than a tightening choice. The seed of the camera wheel as potential "key" is planted but never tested on the page, and the rose appearance feels like a symbolic gift rather than a consequence of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"to puzzle out new equations for hope"—is signaled early but remains conceptually abstract throughout. Lila encounters no meaningful opposition or tightening: the sextant piece is simply lodged in a crack, she pries it free without cost, and the terminal's systems respond to her recalibration without friction or failure. The single reversal (the terminal shuddering and humming) is atmospheric rather than a consequence of protagonist choice. No visible price is paid; the "raw, untested" equation is declared rather than earned through a trade-off that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira's dream of wandering versus keep-bound safety. Pressure tightens when the bear appears, forcing her from observation to embodied choice (reaching toward the quartz). The forecourt's song acts as a reversal that reframes the keep from prison to compass. Cost is implied—years lost, self made small—but the final turn (deciding to "listen" while staying) lacks a visible forfeiture or tactical price paid on the page that would elevate to high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake ("unravel the threads of deception") is declared early but remains abstract—no on-page test where failure costs Elias something concrete. The sundial's redirection to the warehouse is a single tightening, but no reversal: he encounters no locked door, hostile presence, or ambiguous choice. The blueprint "revelation" is handed to him without a trade-off or visible sacrifice. Coincidence (a lit lantern, an open door, papers conveniently waiting) eases rather than complicates. Agency is observation, not decision under duress, and the ending reconfigures understanding without foreclosing a live path or paying a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the rope to find the weavers' loom—is signaled early but the escalation remains conceptual: each knot reveals information without narrowing Elias's options or raising tangible cost. The woman's arrival delivers answers rather than complicating his pursuit. The final image reconfigures his understanding of the loom as metaphor, but no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a path; wisdom accrues without dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the vanished woman's story—is signaled early. However, no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs: Elara kneels, touches the thread, imagines, the woman appears, Elara writes, the woman vanishes, Elara leaves satisfied. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible price paid. The vision grants her exactly what she sought without friction. The final paragraphs assert ongoing work but do not dramatize a cost or trade-off on the page. Under Accumulative lens, pressure should build to a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the ending diffuses into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the egg begins to crack, narrowing Corvin's options. However, the resolution is delivered by the orb's autonomous power rather than Corvin's agency; he adjusts a lens, then the egg hatches on its own, and the world transforms without a visible price paid by the protagonist. Coincidence (the egg's autonomous hatching) resolves rather than complicates. Cost clarity is absent: Corvin's struggle does not foreclose a path or impose a felt trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: proving scars can heal/sing. The bird repair offers one escalation beat but the pressure is diffused—Mara owns the emotional choice (letting go), Lira facilitates without personal cost or trade-off. The man's comment about her father is deflected cleanly with no friction. No reversal narrows Lira's options; the resolution (grain released) is contemplative summary rather than a decision under duress. Accumulative lens expects deepening; here the theme is restated without tightening prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped memories—is signaled early and pursued linearly. However, escalation is minimal: each breadcrumb is found without complication, and no reversal narrows Lira's options or forces a trade-off. The marble retrieval ("fingers scraped raw") gestures at physical cost, but it's a single sentence that doesn't alter her tactics or foreclose a path. The fountains' restoration is spectacular but external; Lira's own agency at closure is completing a scavenger hunt rather than making a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding why the Enclave abandoned fire—is signaled early. However, escalation occurs through the ghost's exposition rather than Lumin's agency under mounting pressure. The ghost simply explains the answer rather than Lumin earning it through a choice that forecloses options. No visible price is paid; Lumin achieves understanding and walks away with a promise, leaving the gear behind in a symbolic rather than costly act. One tightening occurs (the sonar pinging intensifies, guiding deeper) but it leads to information delivery, not a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Marlow's need to articulate unspoken grief and join the family's poetic tradition—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: the nightly returns across the butterfly migration accumulate ancestral stories, and the spectral voice's final lesson ("words outlive us") reweights the ribbon as bridge rather than burden. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the spectral voice delivers insights rather than forcing Marlow to struggle for them, and the poem's composition occurs off-page between penultimate and final beats. The butterflies' arrival and departure function as atmospheric markers rather than obstacles, and the closure cost (tomorrow's gravestone carving) is deferred, making the felt price oblique rather than unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the pendulum to prevent chaos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates when the Hush deepens and Lirael aligns the rake handle with the bob's runes, a meaningful tightening. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the bob simply "remembers its purpose" without Lirael sacrificing an option or enduring a cost that alters her stance. The ending relief feels consequential but not earned through a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the tapestry's story—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. Elara decodes threads in a frictionless sequence; each discovery "brings her closer to the truth" without complication or reversal. The chess clock's echo and the phrase "silence between moves" suggest thematic escalation but no on-page choice narrows her path or imposes visible cost. Agency is observational rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the thaw and vindicating predictive modeling—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through the Elders' derision and the equinox test, but the reversal (ice cracks) is observational rather than driven by Lira's on-page agency at that beat. The "weeks passed" summary compresses the labor that should dramatize her persistence under mounting doubt. Cost is implied (cramped hands, bloodshot eyes) but remains atmospheric; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the resolution. The agency test for high-band entry is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories via pirate broadcasts—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains static across the scene. The broadcast strengthens, Lira transcribes, and she leaves; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option or alters tactics. The "key to unlocking the next fragment" is declared but not tested against cost or complication. Agency is present in her sustained attention and transcription, yet the resolution is incremental accumulation rather than a choice that narrows paths or deepens consequence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—crystallizing a fleeting emotion—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Lira performs a ritual (grinding charcoal, sprinkling ash) without encountering opposition or a tightening that narrows her options; Elias's warning ("You're chasing ghosts") generates no friction or decision point. The portrait emerges incomplete by design, not by conflict-driven forfeit. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is expected, but the piece cycles through meditative description without a pressure point that forces a trade-off or alters tactics with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's mission to preserve ancient navigation methods against Mara's pragmatic dismissal—is signaled early and tightens when he unearths the needle and aligns it with the cog. However, the escalation is more thematic deepening than a choice that forecloses a live option; Mara's presence complicates but does not force a trade-off with visible cost. The ending ("he kept digging") reaffirms his stance rather than narrowing his path, and the cost ("his hands bled, his back ached") is physical effort without a felt relational or conceptual price that charges the closure under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving vanishing arts—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete obstacle or reversal that narrows options. Elias's arrival and the violin's unveiling could serve as a tightening, yet no cost or trade-off follows: they simply play together and the choir grows off-page. The story presents a want ("braid diverse voices") without an on-page friction or escalation moment that forces a sacrifice or alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming the knowledge fruit seed—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: Elara prunes away traumatic memories and selects gentler ones, and the bud forms. However, the pruning's success feels guaranteed rather than tested; the plant's "resistance" is mentioned but not dramatized as a genuine obstacle that might cause failure. The alignment peaks on schedule, the bud forms as expected, and no live cost or trade-off is visible on the page. Agency reads passive—she executes a known method rather than choosing under conflicting pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the tower and rekindling wonder—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Clara discovers drones, Voss explains, Clara speaks, problem solved. No meaningful tightening occurs; Voss's exposition removes uncertainty rather than raising cost. The resolution depends on Clara's speech rather than a choice that forecloses options. The blackout as "failure of wonder" is thematically interesting but lacks on-page pressure testing—Clara never faces a trade-off between her routine comfort and the risk of speaking out.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is clear, but pressure never escalates; Lira arranges objects without opposition, uncertainty, or cost. The orris root experiment succeeds immediately with no reversal or complication. No tightening narrows options, no visible price is paid, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation rather than a choice under duress. The "sanctification" arrives as a granted result rather than an earned turn, leaving the piece feeling like a demonstration rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (cure for ocean blight) is signaled early and personal (grandmother's vanishing). The tightening occurs when Mara must thread fingers into fissures and then drink the ampoule despite uncertainty. Agency is present in the drinking choice, which forecloses the path of passivity and transforms her into a catalyst-bearer. The cost is legible but muted—we see blight receding "in threads" rather than a visceral price Mara pays. Escalation is clean under the causal lens but emotional stakes feel more declared than dramatized in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: capture perpetual motion to mirror lost love. The rupture (slamming his fist) is an on-page protagonist action that transforms the system, creating the dice orbit—one meaningful tightening with visible cost (he can no longer touch them). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the proofs, the loops, and the final renunciation all deepen his engagement with the impossibility. The ending reweights his goal from possession to acceptance, and the price is legible in "they danced out of reach."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early but remains abstract until Mr. Voss's arrival. His recognition of Elena provides confirmation rather than forcing Lila to trade competing goods or endure a loss. The escalation is a deepening through accumulation (brush, moon, portrait) rather than a causal tightening, but the final moment lacks a visible price. Coincidence delivers the proof Lila seeks; her agency does not compel the turn. One meaningful pressure point exists (painting Elena's eyes), but it does not narrow options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—rescue dying arts—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when Lila decides to host a festival and teach, but this turn is executed as summary ("she'd host a festival, revive the opera, bake bread") without on-page resistance or a visible trade-off. No live constraint (time, resource, opposition) narrows her options; the children's arrival and their request to learn feel cooperative rather than testing. Cost is told ("fragile optimism") not shown in a forfeited path or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the hunger stone's power to "step beyond fate"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elias's failed first attempt (yoyo strikes sand, light vanishes) creates a meaningful reversal, and his improvisation (mercury coil) escalates pressure. However, the resolution lacks visible cost: the feedback loop succeeds without trade-off, injury, or renunciation. The phrase "he'd just picked it" trivializes the climax. Under the Causal lens, escalation is present but the price at closure is abstract rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (break the curse, survive the shadow) is signaled early and Mara's agency drives the peak turn when she speaks the paradox and grips the thread. The tightening is present but thin: the shadow recoils, moths swarm, she holds firm, and the room shatters—escalation reads more as description than as narrowing options with visible cost. The thread vanishes without consequence beyond the cloak's glow upgrade, so the final image doesn't charge prior choices with felt loss. Under the Causal lens, the escalation is functional but the cost at closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming chaos into harmony—is signaled early and sustained. Leeward's agency is embodied in her mallet work, and the orchard responds (trees shudder, apples thud), but the progression is additive rather than escalating. There is no meaningful reversal or tightening; she adjusts grip, strikes again, and layers sound without genuine resistance or a moment where options narrow. The seabird screech is incorporated smoothly rather than forcing a trade-off. The ending conveys a sense of victory, but the cost (physical fatigue) does not reweight prior material or foreclose a live alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the watchers began to move—is signaled early and tightens through Lira's discovery of the crack, the journal entry, and the watchers' arrival. The escalation is driven by her agency (chipping the shell, following the symbols, playing the whistle) under a Causal lens. The final reversal (gate kept them in, not out) reweights prior material and the shells' cracking delivers an on-page consequence. However, the cost to Lira personally—beyond witnessing the city's collapse—is not made viscerally legible in her body or renunciation, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recapturing truth buried by censorship—is signaled early and tightens when the rosebush petal warning introduces urgency. Tomas's entrance complicates the investigation, and the tunnel symbols deepen Elara's understanding. However, escalation relies on Elara receiving exposition rather than facing genuine opposition or trade-offs; coincidence (Tomas's timely arrival, the chamber's intact ledgers) advances plot without protagonist-driven reversals. The ending reweights meaning but does not foreclose a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping erosion versus unearthing personal legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the hidden chamber appears. The groan beneath the floor creates a reversal that narrows options: ignore or investigate. Elara's agency drives the turn (she wrests open the hatch), and the discovery reweights her ritual from solitary gesture to inherited practice. However, the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; she gains validation without losing a competing option or enduring a trade-off on the page. The escalation is sufficient for this length but stops short of a felt price that charges tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (trace honest origins) is signaled early and tightens once: the vault discovery narrows options from passive cataloging to active witness-bearing. The protagonist's sketch-and-stamp action opens the door, demonstrating agency. The journal reveal reweights the city's fall from external disaster to internal denial, a meaningful deepening. The final choice to share (leaving the door ajar, taking the journal) forecloses solitary preservation with felt cost in the swim home. No secondary antagonist, but the city's buried truth supplies coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: transform grief into something that can fly, confront the shadow without fleeing. The lantern-crafting beat tightens pressure as her brother's voice spills out, creating "luminous torment." However, the shadow's return and dissolution feel convenient rather than earned—she holds up the lantern, whispers "I see you," and it recoils without resistance or trade-off. No visible price is paid; the cranes take flight and she simply polishes the next gem. One meaningful tightening (the lantern's emotional flood) occurs, but closure lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding and accessing unused potential—is signaled early and drives the descent. Pressure tightens when alarms blare and Orion urges abort, forcing Elara's defiant choice to continue. The vortex encounter provides one reversal (images of her fiancé alive appear, but she focuses on "raw edges"), and her final walk with the new crystal narrows options (she's no longer a survivor, now a hunter). However, the node's instability is declared but never tests her with a tangible cost during access; she steps in, the geode shatters, light erupts, and she emerges with a better tool—luck resolves the peak beat, undercutting agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (decode the frequency via chip fragments) is signaled early and pursued. The lever-pull constitutes one meaningful tightening that narrows options under the Causal-Accumulative lens. However, the tightening is mechanical rather than agonistic—Lira hesitates briefly, then pulls without visible trade-off or competing desire. No persistent constraint (time, resource, rival claim) shapes tactics. The pilgrim's arrival complicates but does not oppose; coincidence (constellation overhead at the right moment) enables rather than tests. Cost at closure is conceptual (the unknown) but not felt as forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—discovering the weight of Lila's withheld truth—is clear and drives the beach sequence. The driftwood visions provide one meaningful tightening: Elias learns the brother was erased, which narrows his options to either continue the lie or reveal the truth. The cost of his decision is asserted ("some truths were too heavy to carry alone") but not paid on the page; we don't witness Lila's reaction or a forfeited relationship, only Elias's anticipatory dread.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—conducting the exchange without repeating past failures—is signaled early and tightens once (the decision to drop the pull). However, the exchange itself is summarized ("went smoothly") rather than dramatized, so the peak pressure moment is told rather than shown. The final reconfiguration (Clara walks through the storm) carries emotional weight but lacks a visible on-page cost or trade-off that forces her hand. One meaningful deepening is present but escalation under the Accumulative lens needed a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Clara must decide whether to keep hiding (follow external markers, carry regrets) or navigate by her own choices. The climb to the lighthouse and the decision to leave the compass provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Cost is present but partly abstract: she leaves the compass and paddles toward town, which forecloses the grandfather's talisman, yet the story asserts rather than dramatizes what she loses—no on-page moment where we see her hand hesitate, no pang of doubt as she pulls away. The ex's fight and the friends' no-show establish pressure, but both are off-page; the solo paddle lacks a tangible on-page obstacle or reversal that tests her resolve under immediate duress.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—relearning empathy and confronting past guilt—is signaled early but remains abstract. The journey tightens options spatially (hospital → archives → bodega → lake), yet no on-page reversal forces Mara to sacrifice one path for another. J.T.'s appearance and the reflections deepen knowledge, but Mara's agency at closure is a vow rather than a decision with visible cost. The phrase "holding the pain of others because you've known your own" tells the thematic price without dramatizing what Mara forfeits or endures to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reforging the bond with the phoenix—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the phoenix's ghost "urges her toward the ritual" and "to refuse was to let the bond fray entirely," creating a binary that should force a hard choice. However, Lira's resistance collapses off-stage ("she did not fight it") without a dramatized moment where competing goods clash or a visible cost alters tactics. The ritual sequence (singing, receiving tokens, metamorphosis) proceeds as a checklist rather than escalating through reversals. The ending reconfigures her role, but the cost (losing her human self) is abstract; no specific relationship, memory, or capability is named as forfeited on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—seeking penance for her mother's absence—is signaled early and drives the card-laying and ascent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the saucer's crack widens and light seeps through, forcing the climb. However, escalation is primarily textural (accumulating symbolic gestures) rather than a narrowing of options or a visible tradeoff. The resolution (healed saucer, mother's handprint) arrives as discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost. Coincidence (the tree appearing, the nest containing the saucer) complicates but also resolves, which softens agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt emotionally but not dramatized as a renunciation or endurance that closes off a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: open the locked dimension to stabilize the ship. One tightening: Lira must face her shadow to activate Kwan Yin's Tear. The escalation is largely internal (memories wash over her) rather than a sequence of narrowing tactical choices. The door's resistance dissolves when she "begins to stitch...with words, memories, truth"—a solution that feels declared rather than fought for. Cost is present (locket shatters, shadows coil) but abstracts the price; no live option is visibly foreclosed. Agency at closure reads more as acceptance than decision with trade-off. Under the Causal lens, the because/therefore chain holds but the final turn lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Lira's quest to understand transformation—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The man's appearance provides a complication but not a meaningful tightening of options; he delivers answers rather than forcing Lira to choose between competing goods. Her release of the final bug feels compliant rather than agency-driven. The prophecy frame suggests high stakes but no visible cost or trade-off appears on the page—releasing bugs carries no apparent price, and the ending grants her peace without foreclosing a meaningful alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—unlock the sundial cipher to find the cradle—is signaled early but never tightens. The piece advances through discovery beats (Kieran believes, Elara confirms, they succeed) without reversal, complication, or a choice that narrows options. The blackout is framed as a test yet imposes no on-page obstacle; success is frictionless. No visible cost at closure: descending the stairs is reward, not renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred order—is signaled early and pressure tightens through vision-fragments that show both harmony and catastrophic storm. The rock-arrangement sequences (Fibonacci, Pascal's triangle, Möbius strip, final obsidian shard) constitute meaningful attempts that narrow options. However, the resolution hinges on Lira's internal shift ("not to control… but to witness") more than a protagonist-driven trade-off with visible cost; the storm dissipates and eels respond without a clear on-page price that alters her circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—writing verses the Ministry can't burn and understanding scars—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via the storm's intensification and the envelope's revelation, narrowing options toward the decision to strip his poetry bare. However, the escalation is more textural than causal; the storm complicates mood but doesn't force a hard choice, and the final act (sealing and planning to mail) feels more like confirmation than a forked path with visible alternative cost. One meaningful tightening (the cartographer's words mirror his need) is present but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—philosophical translation via duel—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live consequence or visible price grounds the contest. Elyra disarms Kael, yet the moment deflates immediately with "I evolve," erasing tactical loss. The tin-card decoding offers a mid-duel tightening, but the discovery arrives without prior struggle or failed attempts, reducing earned pressure. Agency at closure is cooperative rather than agonistic, and the final "wherever the questions take us" avoids a choice that forecloses an option or imposes felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Cedar's need to rebuild identity through the tin—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened; the poems are always accessible, Marla poses no obstacle, and the molting shift at the end adds complexity without foreclosing a prior path. The new poem's directive ("become the anarchy") offers a thematic pivot but no on-page tactical cost or decision that narrows Cedar's options. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake with felt pressure; here the final beat asserts resolution ("he didn't panic") without dramatizing the trade-off or loss that would charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Clara seeking refuge from "the chaos of choice"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The middle discovery (film reel, hidden room) provides a spatial tightening, but no live option is foreclosed; Clara simply gains access to a better piano. The ending declares she'll "surprise fate back," yet no prior pressure forced this stance; she plays without visible trade-off or consequence. Coincidence (finding the film reel, the latch) drives discovery rather than protagonist agency. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (descent into the hidden room), but the lack of felt cost at closure caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting collective memory before the monsoon—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening forces a live trade-off or forecloses an option. The cavern encounter offers a choice framed as "fear versus courage," yet Lira's decision ("Show me the fracture") meets no resistance or visible price. The mirrors shatter and reform without altering her tactics or costing her anything tangible. One meaningful deepening occurs (the shift from doubt to resolve) but the cost is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira finding and reconciling with her father—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The lace-stitching sequence (acknowledgment, admission, forgiveness) provides a three-step tightening, but each step succeeds without friction; the compass hums, the needle locks, the water parts on cue. No live option is foreclosed: Yorick's method works exactly as promised, and Lira's apology is accepted immediately. The cost (years of silence, mutual regret) is named but not tested; we do not see what either character risks or loses by this reunion beyond the abstract weight of "unspoken apologies."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake in professional identity escalates under accumulative lens through agency-driven observations (e.g., chrysalis monitoring), narrowing options and forcing trade-offs. Cost is unmistakable in her ignored institute calls and newfound humility. Pressure coheres without coincidence, with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after survival—is signaled early and escalates under the causal lens through Lirael's agency: retracing steps, reading frost, and interpreting the shard. Escalation tightens options and deepens knowledge, with cost legible in her hollow creativity and physical crawl.

The final choice has conceptual weight but limited on-page cost, keeping the conflict band solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael can transform her personal silence into a meaningful, shareable form of music—is present early and escalates through the faint first tone and then the emotionally loaded lullaby experiment. Elias’s ongoing presence gently increases pressure and audience, culminating in the plants’ response and later worldwide performances. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and relatively unopposed; there’s little on-page resistance, risk of failure, or concrete cost when she opens her work to others, so escalation feels more like steady flowering than a tested, high-stakes choice. The price of vulnerability and exposure is implied but not fully dramatized at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stakes (reviving the city’s heart vs. letting it remain a tomb, and Elias’s relation to “rest”) are clear, and there is one major tightening when he commits to repairing the lens. However, opposition is soft: his resistance is mostly verbal and evaporates quickly, and the repair process passes without significant setbacks or concrete jeopardy. The choice to stay in the city implies a cost but isn’t framed as a pressured trade-off on the page, muting the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stake—whether the community will remain fragmented by fear or risk visibility to become a true mutual-aid network—is clear and grounded in survival under sanctions. The escalation from anonymous, low-risk charity to public self-naming via the bell is coherent, and the immediate “loss” of donations after her declaration gives visible cost. However, opposition (the council’s fear, the risk from authorities) remains mostly abstract and off-page, so pressure never quite feels acute. The resolution is earned but relatively gentle in emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding where unused love is stored—is present but largely abstract and unopposed. Once she takes the Tear, every method she tries (breathing, following light, touching the pool) succeeds immediately without testing her resolve or forcing trade-offs. There is no meaningful escalation or narrowing of options; knowledge simply arrives in ever-clearer metaphors. As a result, the “conflict” reads more like guided revelation than tension, limiting emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s attempt to manipulate the “texture of time” via the garden—is clear from the outset and escalates as the experiment destabilizes space and memory. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the garden’s geometry warps and the bridge collapses; her agency in pressing the fragment and pulling at all threads at once clearly triggers the crisis. However, the cost to her options or safety never feels fully sharpened beyond overwhelming visions and a brief collapse, and the re-stabilization arrives without a hard trade-off between competing harms. The conflict functions well but stops short of a truly searing dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake (recover and use the seeds before scavengers do) is clear and threaded throughout, and pressure does rise as the scavengers close in and begin working the keys themselves. Her agency drives the key turns—decoding, opening the vault, taking a single vial, breaking her chains, and weaponizing the seeds. However, conflict with the scavengers stays largely off-stage and abstract; they never get a genuine near-win or complex interaction with her, which mutes the sense of risk. Costs are implied (if she fails, her people starve; if she succeeds, she risks her life), but we don’t see a concrete sacrifice beyond danger and the one vial used as a weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking tied to her father’s disappearance—is clear and present from early on. There is one main tightening beat when the initial mixture of absences is “close but not enough,” forcing her to escalate to cutting the tree root linked to her father’s work, which nicely deepens cost. However, opposition is largely abstract and internal, with minimal resistance or genuine risk beyond sensory pain; the path from problem to solution is relatively smooth. The result is emotionally textured but lightly pressurized conflict rather than gripping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—stealing the jar without triggering defenses or losing something irreplaceable—is clear, and the requirement of an offering of “equal weight” is a strong conceptual turn. However, both external and internal pressures escalate only mildly: the guard never truly threatens, the mechanisms fail with one elegant trick, and Elara’s debate over the photograph is quick and relatively painless on the page. The reversal when the jar illuminates rather than takes the photo is interesting but softens the felt cost, retroactively making the risk seem safe. As a result, tension is present but never gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering a blueprint for “safe zones” and, internally, redefining what safety for inquiry means—is clear but only mildly pressured. The external goal is achieved with limited resistance (a rusted screw, some prying, then the reveal), and the internal shift around abandonment feels more contemplative than forced by on-page conflict. There is a single meaningful deepening when the schematics are found, linking him to the unknown engineer, but few options are truly foreclosed. Cost remains mostly implicit and conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—Lila’s life and autonomy versus the mob’s pursuit, braided with her need to redefine herself—is clear, and the arrival of the armed enforcer provides a credible spike in pressure. Her decision to stand her ground and use the decrypted notes against him is a real tightening moment. However, the physical confrontation resolves quickly and almost bloodlessly, and the subsequent legal takedown occurs off-page with minimal friction or sacrifice. The external conflict feels under-costed relative to what’s been declared.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—creating the map before the last star vanishes and the hush dissipates—is clear but largely internal and aesthetic. There is a gentle escalation as the hush deepens, the booklet resists, and the star nears extinction, yet Mara faces no real opposition beyond mild strain and atmospheric pressure. She never appears at risk of failing or paying a non-trivial price; her endurance is quietly tested but never meaningfully cornered. The result is beautiful but low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Unit-17 can grapple with self-awareness and the origin of thoughts—is clear, and the violin encounter provides a structural tightening. Yet conflict is remarkably smooth: there’s no genuine resistance, failure, or painful trade-off as the robot enters loops, meets other units, and “passes” the test. The “final exam” language promises more tension than the scene delivers, leaving the journey intellectually interesting but low in felt risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake is Elias’s stance toward silence and truth, and there is a clear escalation from passive registrar to active interpreter. However, opposition is minimal: nothing seriously resists his choice to follow the map or accept Lira’s invitation, and danger is only gestured at via decoded symbols like “Danger.” The result is a nicely pressurized mood but relatively low dramatic tension. The ending choice feels meaningful on a conceptual level but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—whether human intuition and care still matter against algorithmic control—is clear but remains mostly philosophical rather than viscerally pressured. Elara never faces a meaningful risk of failure or loss; Joren’s skepticism is mild and easily dissolved by a single demonstration. The blocking of the sensor is a nice tactical beat, but it doesn’t escalate into a tougher choice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    There is a clear escalation beat when the nexus destabilizes and the alien creatures begin thrashing, forcing Veyra into urgent recalibration. However, the tension resolves quickly and smoothly, with her competence never seriously in doubt and no meaningful sacrifice required. The dominant stake (proving the sideways nature of time vs. risking the station and specimens) is implied but never sharply framed or forced into a trade-off. The ending’s “we’re not done yet” resets stakes rather than crystallizing a hard-earned new status.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the ghost’s existence and reclaiming the unfinished symphony—is clear, but the on-page conflict is largely internal and rarely cornering. There is one meaningful tightening when the water-damaged program reveals the symbols and then is nearly lost in the sudden gush, forcing her into hurried note-taking and memorization. However, external opposition is light, and her choice to commit to “I’ll finish it” doesn’t visibly foreclose another live path or extract a concrete price yet. The pressure feels more like a deepening mood than a true escalation of risk or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael continues to uphold a dangerous lie or acts on the truth—emerges clearly and tightens once she reads the QUARANTINE file. Her agency drives the main turn: she chooses to leave the station and seek non-instrumental knowledge in the village. The internal and external conflicts interweave, but opposition remains mostly implied; no one or nothing on the page actively resists her, so escalation is more intellectual/emotional than contested. This keeps the tension thoughtful but slightly soft for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the buried truth of the mill—is clear, and there is one meaningful escalation as turning the valve opens the shaft, leads him into the chamber, and triggers the revelation. The hum, dust, and machine activation suggest danger and narrow his options somewhat. However, Elias is never forced into a sharp trade-off between safety and truth or between different harms; the machine scares but does not genuinely demand a costly choice. As a result, the conflict feels more like a guided revelation than a pressured crucible, limiting escalation and on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—attaining regenerative silence and nonjudgmental witnessing—is well signaled but not strongly pressured. Escalation is primarily symbolic (moving deeper, shedding layers of self) rather than confrontational; obstacles like the tunnel, staircase, and door yield with minimal struggle. The cost of loosening their grip on reality is implied but never sharply problematized or opposed by any counter-desire. As a result, tension is steady but gentle, without a truly tightening crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Mara’s skepticism versus Elara’s insistence on ordinary magic—is coherent and carries through from the first mention of the curl to Mara’s final acceptance. The eclipse deepening and the curl’s glow function as a single meaningful tightening that tests Mara’s stance. However, there’s little real resistance or risk; Mara complies quickly, and the shift to belief happens without a tangible price or serious inner struggle. As a result, tension feels gentle and illustrative rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual: whether humanity’s embedded stories (and dreams) remain dead static or can be reawakened through attention. Pressure builds gently as Elias moves from sifting ashes to deciphering dragons to realizing the axis is attentional, culminating in the tapestry’s activation and the voices rising. However, opposition is largely abstract—no counterforce, danger, or conflicting desire tests his commitment—and his path never meaningfully narrows. The result is a beautifully textured escalation that lacks a sharp moment of forced trade-off or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what Elara will do with inherited clandestine power—is signaled and carried through to her decision to “finish what her father started.” Discovery of the letters provides a clear escalation of knowledge, and choosing a specific dockworker offers a concrete externalization of her new commitment. However, there’s minimal counter-pressure: no antagonist presence, no immediate risk, and little sense of what she might lose; the “be careful: the flow you direct can become a flood” line isn’t tested on the page. The conflict feels more like a smooth upgrade in purpose than a pressured trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the possession by destabilizing the anchor’s stillness—is established and escalates as loops intensify, lights flicker, the anchor cracks, and the void opens. The priest’s agency clearly drives the turns; each rhetorical layer is a deliberate escalation. However, the sense of risk and potential loss (to him or the wider world) stays more conceptual than visceral, and no serious alternative path or trade-off is dramatized. The final outcome forecloses the possession and the old stability, but the price feels abstract rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—can she wrest something timeless from linear time before exhaustion—exists and is signaled, with a mild ticking clock. Pressure does increase slightly as dawn peaks and the shell flares, prompting her to pause, listen, and then recommit to writing. However, conflict remains largely internal and unopposed; no live option is meaningfully foreclosed, and the cost of failure feels abstract. The result is beautiful texture with relatively low narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue to float above her life or accept the cost of being fully grounded in one self—is clear and present from early on. The right-path choice at the first arch is a meaningful turn, and the final decision to land does foreclose her habitual mode of escape. Yet the pressure rarely feels acute: there’s no moment where remaining ungrounded has an on-page cost she nearly chooses anyway, or where embracing one timeline visibly harms another. As a result, the emotional and ethical calculus feels more declared than tested, keeping escalation just short of truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lila’s struggle against emotional numbness—is established early and pursued throughout, with a clear tightening when she first plays the reversed record and feels her numbness begin to fray. Conflict is predominantly internal and situational rather than confrontational; external resistance is minimal, with Elias largely facilitating instead of opposing. The escalation from solitary experiment to sharing the hush with students and others offers a satisfying deepening rather than a sharp reversal. Because no major option is visibly foreclosed and the price of reopening herself to feeling is only lightly sketched, the sense of risk remains somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias remains a detached observer or risks himself to expose an engineered plague—is clear and escalates from eerie suspicion to entering a biohazard zone. However, once he agrees to help and receives the vial, the path out is frictionless: there’s no on-page confrontation, chase, or direct threat from the authorities. His internal cost is acknowledged (risk to isolation and safety) but not fully stressed in scene. The conflict is coherent and rising, but it never quite tightens to a vise.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will risk psychic/emotional unraveling to confront the vial’s scent—is clear, and her decision to proceed is a meaningful micro-turn. The memory-vision intensifies her emotional exposure, but the experience itself unfolds smoothly without real resistance, complication, or price beyond tears. By the time we reach her walk home, the conflict feels resolved with minimal lingering tension or trade-off. The result is a gentle, coherent arc with relatively low pressure and little true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is whether Kael will confront his history of abandoned choices by engaging with the rope—unravel, keep, or cut—and that triad is clearly articulated. Pressure escalates from philosophical conversation to a personal decision with emotional cost, and the memories released by each knot give some sense of price. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and abstract; we don’t see a major foreclosed external path or a sharp moral bind beyond fear vs. self-knowledge. The choice is meaningful but lands as a quiet deepening rather than a hard, high-stakes turn.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can transform a paralyzing communal silence into something generative—is clear but gently pressed. Pressure escalates texturally as she moves from tentative note to full resonance and communal offering, but there is little sense of risk or the possibility of failure; opposition is more implied than dramatized. Her agency drives the turn (choosing to use the bowl, then to reframe it), yet she is never forced into a hard trade-off. As a result, the emotional cost and narrowing of options feel somewhat soft for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s desire to forget versus the cost of losing joy—is clear and localized in the exchange over *Eclipsed Memories*. There is one mild tightening as she hesitates and asks, “Will it hurt?”, but this resistance resolves quickly once she samples the scent, with little sense of a live alternative path. Elias faces no real challenge to his practice or ethic; he presents the price, but it is neither contested nor shown to trouble him on the page. As a result, tension feels low and the story reads more as an elegant vignette than a pressured decision space.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Clara’s shift from abstracted, transactional seeing to active, compassionate engagement; this is signaled but never put under real pressure. Once she decides to investigate the envelope, resistance is minimal: the boardinghouse scene is frictionless, she finds Lila easily, and the forged letter succeeds without complication. The internal ethical conflict over forging the letter is gestured at but not dramatized as a dilemma with genuine risk or downside. As a result, escalation feels modest and the resolution feels low-cost and somewhat preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s desire to reconnect community and ease his loneliness—is clear, but escalation is gentle and relatively flat. His search unfolds without serious obstacles or real risk; the “test” Lira mentions arrives retroactively rather than as felt pressure during his pursuit. The reveal that Lira is Veyra is structurally a turn but not much of a crucible, because no painful trade-off or narrowing of options occurs. As a result, tension is more meditative than tightening, which limits the category.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lila’s desire to understand the canals’ echoes and test the pendant—develops clearly, and the escalation from strange ripples to an otherworldly tunnel is effective. Her choice to enter the fissure and twist the pendant is a real commitment, but the danger and potential loss (physical or existential) are only lightly gestured at. The “price” paid is mostly abstract (possible professional dismissal, awareness of “borrowed moments”) rather than a concrete sacrifice that alters her options. As a result, tension feels intriguing rather than truly pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her relationship to her brother’s disappearance through this ritual—is clear and consistent, and pressure does deepen as the resonance builds and she glimpses his face. The escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than decisively confrontational, but it does achieve one meaningful tightening when the mosaic reconfigures into constellations and she re-reads his “message.” The cost is quiet but present: she gives up the fantasy of solving grief like an equation and must accept loss as ongoing and unstable. Still, the conflict remains relatively gentle, with little sense that any real option might be foreclosed beyond her prior interpretive frame.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will use the tape’s pull to seek its source and potentially risk visibility—is sketched but never brought under sharp pressure. Escalation exists in the growing intensity of the sense memory and the eerie voices, yet there’s little real opposition; nothing on the page meaningfully threatens her or the patrons if she fails or succeeds. The discovery of the decoder resolves the external question quickly and smoothly. The internal tension between staying hidden and becoming visible is conceptually strong but never forces a concrete trade-off in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will continue to over-control or release control in her work—is legible early and tightened at the hellebore’s metamorphosis. The key escalation is her decision to withdraw her hand, choosing observation and trust over intervention. The cost is mostly conceptual (letting go of her old approach and ego as the expert), which reads but doesn’t bite very hard on the page. There are no strong reversals or complications beyond that central pivot, keeping tension relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Marin’s struggle to find meaning and artistic renewal—is clear, but the escalating pressure remains relatively low-key. The main tightening comes with the stranger’s offer of an exchange and the implied risk of using an uncanny object in her work, which she accepts without much inner or outer conflict. There is no strong reversal; once the brooch appears, the path to resolution is almost entirely smooth. The cost of her choice is felt conceptually rather than dramatized, leaving the conflict satisfying but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to “safe,” celebratory magic or accept volatile, uncontrollable forces—is legible and tightens through the pilgrim’s escalating invitations and demonstrations. The main turn is her decision to fully “hold it” and let the unseen forces inhabit her, which directly triggers destruction and reconfiguration. However, much of the pressure is exerted by the pilgrim rather than by competing values within Elara; her internal resistance is brief and mostly verbal. The cost (physical damage to the cave and the darkening of her magic) is clear but could feel more agonizingly weighed at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering a fractured history and symbolically healing the harbor—is clear but remains largely abstract. Opposition is soft: time, silence, and social withdrawal rather than active resistance, so the “staggered intervals” mostly yield success without meaningful jeopardy. Each shard adds information but doesn’t significantly narrow Lirael’s options or force a painful trade-off; she never risks losing status, safety, or a relationship. As a result, escalation feels gentle and contemplative rather than pressured, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary conflict is Elias versus his own inertia and secrecy, with the external puzzle functioning smoothly rather than challengingly. Escalation is mild: each step (arrows → wall → chamber → figure) opens without genuine resistance or cost. His choice to accept the ticket and the new map is thematically framed but not strongly pressured in-scene—no meaningful option is dramatized as dangerous or irretrievably lost. As a result, tension is present but never truly tight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will cling to skepticism or open herself to the tile’s magic and Aelia’s legacy—is clear but relatively low-intensity. Escalation exists in the increasing vividness of the memories and her choice to keep writing, yet the pressure never quite forces a sharp trade-off or visible loss. Her final stance (keep the tile now, return it later, accept some mystery) is coherent but carries only a soft, implied cost to her old worldview. The conflict functions, but it feels contemplative rather than strongly testing her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—remain in immortal stagnation vs risk the frightening unknown beyond goodbye—is clear and escalates as the storm peaks and the prison destabilizes. The storm provides a time pressure, and the mirror of the “version of himself who’d chosen to stay” is a strong tightening beat. The final act of pressing amulets together is a real commitment that forecloses the option of safe stasis. Conflict is slightly undercut by the lack of meaningful pushback or failed attempt; once the path is articulated, success feels nearly assured.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high on paper (asylum, a system-threatening formula, lethal government interest) and signaled early. The initial beat with guns drawn is strong, but pressure dissipates almost immediately once Elara speaks; the agents lower their weapons and agree to “Talk” with very little pushback. The central conflict—will she secure safety and protect the math?—resolves via a compressed, low-friction trade with no visible sacrifice beyond risk that never truly bites on the page. This leaves escalation feeling underdeveloped and the resolution under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—Althea’s quest to “collect the textures of different times”—remains almost entirely internal and unchallenged, with no clear opposing force. The lamp’s hum syncing with her breathing could escalate into risk, sacrifice, or altered standing, but instead simply amplifies her existing practice without narrowing options or forcing renunciation. There’s no real reversal or tightening; each dawn is more of the same, only more so. As a result, the piece reads as moodful exposition rather than conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering his erased identity—runs cleanly through the piece, with escalation from passive collecting to targeted pursuit to a personal, high-stakes revelation. The storm and rising tide provide an external tightening that forces movement and creates a sense of danger. However, the cost at the end is primarily conceptual/emotional; there’s little concrete loss or foreclosed option dramatized beyond the shock of knowledge and implied future risk. The conspiracy hook gestures toward deeper stakes but isn’t yet pressure-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can Lira validate the astronomer’s “universal riddle” and thus challenge her own myth-busting identity—is cued early and tightened as the shell hums and the observatory responds. Escalation is present in the growing resonance, spinning dials, and rattling glass, giving a clear pressure peak. However, opposition and cost are soft: the experiment works on the first attempt and Lira faces no serious risk of harm, loss, or failure. The resolution feels more like a smooth unveiling than a test that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the carnival is remade into a sterile, privatized theme park—is clear early and tied to Lira’s role. There is one main escalation: her abstract resistance becomes an organized visual campaign culminating in a formal Council showdown. Yet the opposition folds quickly, with no concessions, losses, or grim new constraints on the page, so pressure doesn’t fully tighten into a costly trade-off. Internal conflict between job obligations and loyalty to vendors is gestured at but not sharply tested at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—leaving a caring human trace before the drones take over—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle. The time constraint (minutes until dawn and drone arrival) offers a structural tightening, yet there’s never a serious risk of failure or a difficult trade-off; everything works as planned. Internal conflict (duty vs personal ritual, futility vs hope) is gestured at but not sharply dramatized into a true dilemma. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping, limiting the score despite a coherent throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is clear—get HB-7 functional before/for the *Horizon’s Breath*’s ascent—but the pressure on that goal never tightens beyond a single, smoothly executed technical fix. There is no genuine reversal or complication once the problem is identified; the suggestion to “patch the wing, but recalibrate the servo” leads to untroubled success. Internal stakes (trusting the basin vs. logic, fear of failure) are implied but not dramatized in choice points. The result is competent conflict that lacks escalation or a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and existential—what rivers “really” are and what that means for her work—with a physical survival accent via Jorn’s warnings and the harsh environment. There is a clear tightening from map reception to plateau to glowing-light revelation, which raises the conceptual stakes. However, Clara’s survival and the extraction of the glowing shard are barely contested; the “you’ll die out there” threat resolves with a quick, summarized near-death rather than an on-page crucible. The result is a satisfying conceptual turn but a relatively soft pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving the town and its communal balance—is clear, and there is a gentle escalation from first faint footsteps to full civic reanimation. However, overt conflict is minimal: no true resistance, jeopardy, or hard trade-off tests Kael’s commitment. The process is more ritual than struggle, so tension never fully tightens into a difficult choice with visible cost. As a result, the story is satisfying but low-pressure in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will weaponize/“harness” the hush or release it—is signaled early and tightened as she moves from the archway into the temple heart. Her key choices (not smashing the vial, placing it on the pedestal, enduring rather than fleeing the voices) clearly drive escalation and resolution. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided, but the external pressure of the storm and potential “flooding the site with ruin” stays mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the moment-by-moment beats. Overall, tension rises, but opposition remains largely atmospheric and metaphysical.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stakes are primarily internal—claiming authorship of his story versus being trapped in his father’s pattern—with hints of external peril (tide, bodies, drowning hush) that never fully bite. There is one clear tightening when the hooded double demands he “finish” the story and reveals the lattice as pen, and another when Elias places his lattice beside his father’s, but no serious alternative path or sacrifice is dramatized. The ghost’s warning (“It’ll drown you”) sets up potential danger that is not truly tested or paid off on the page. As a result, pressure escalates modestly in a lyric, textural way but never feels genuinely constraining or risky for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stakes—freeing the bound soul and ending a karmic debt—are clear, and the resonant awakening provides a distinct escalation beat. Yet most of the pressure is historical or atmospheric; in the present, neither Elara nor the ghost seems to face real risk if the experiment fails now, so the urgency of this moment is muted. Elara’s crucial move (applying bead to fruit) doesn’t feel like a hard trade-off between competing harms but more like solving an introduced mystery. As a result, the emotional and tactical cost at the climax reads more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mending the labyrinth from ruin to reverence—is clear, but opposition is almost entirely implicit (time, decay, and the labor itself). There’s minimal escalation beyond “she keeps going” and no substantive reversal or threat that genuinely endangers her goal. As a result, the climax reads more as completion of a planned ritual than as a hard-won turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can and will rekindle the shrine/faith—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the sundial finally hums and the chamber “pulses like a heartbeat,” demanding a stance. However, opposition is very mild: the roots restrain more than threaten, there’s no serious risk of failure or harm, and her doubts don’t force a hard trade-off. As a result, escalation feels contemplative rather than truly pressured, and the cost of her choice is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are largely intellectual and emotional—understanding the coded messages and their link to Lira’s past—and these stakes are clear and coherent throughout. There is a discernible escalation from abstract curiosity to direct, personal revelation with the grandmother’s hologram, which forces a new commitment. However, opposition and cost are soft: there’s little resistance beyond uncertainty, and each step (letter arrival, decoding, hidden compartment opening) happens with minimal friction or trade-off. The result is engaging but not truly tense, more puzzle-solvey than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—cosmic truth versus council repression—is declared and linked to the impending removal of telescopes, which is a decent inciting pressure. Yet escalation is soft: after Jaxon’s warning, there is no further complication, deadline, or concrete threat to their bodies or plans; Zara simply proceeds to demonstrate her hidden method. Her agency (using the candle to transform the chart) is meaningful but low-cost, and no path is clearly foreclosed in the scene. The result is atmospheric tension without a strong sense of tightening screws.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael can confront and transform her burden of unsaid apologies—is clear, but pressure is quite low. The main tightening is the spirits’ song intensifying and the ritual beginning to work, which deepens rather than complicates her path. There is no substantive resistance, risk, or hard trade-off; once she asks “Show me,” events unfold smoothly toward consolation. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than tested, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can transform trauma-laced “scribbles” and ruins into hopeful meaning—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does deepen when she begins actively rewriting the girl’s notes and then carries that reframing into the peace talks via the coral, which is a genuine, if quiet, escalation. However, external conflict (the collapsed talks, war, ocean damage) is kept mostly offstage, and on-page costs are implied rather than dramatized; nothing she does sharply forecloses a path. The result is thematically resonant but relatively low-tension in experiential terms.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can turn a dead, elegiac district into a living, joyful space—is clear and does intensify from solitary discovery to communal celebration. However, resistance is mostly atmospheric; there’s no active antagonist or concrete obstacle beyond the fog’s inertia. The key “turn” is Marla’s recognition, which deepens emotional stakes but doesn’t quite feel like a hard test of Lira’s commitment. The piece succeeds as a gentle escalation but lacks a sharper moment where a path is truly foreclosed or a difficult trade-off is demanded.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is essentially epistemic: will Marisol unlock what the mural hides and understand what the nickel “awakens,” and how will that reframe her relationship to her grandfather and the garden? There is a clear tightening when the mural shifts from static restoration project to living memory, and again when the flapper with the identical coin appears. However, there is virtually no external opposition and very little internal risk—no sense that failure, misalignment, or awakening the “wrong” thing carries a meaningful price—so tension stays gentle and contemplative. The result is structurally sound but low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (gain entry to the Silent Bloom and weaponize the seed for resistance) is clear, and there is one solid tightening beat in the pheromone test / hidden door sequence. However, every challenge yields quickly and cleanly; the test is passed in seconds, the club accepts him almost without suspicion, and the final act in the garden faces no live opposition. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than felt, with very little trade-off or visible risk to Elias or Lillian on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can transform her pain and compulsion into a livable truce—is clear, and the postcard introduces the key pressure of reimagining her art’s function. Escalation is more textural than confrontational: she increasingly externalizes her work, until the seed/tree literalize the armistice and allow sleep. However, conflict is soft; she rarely faces a difficult, on-page choice where a live option is clearly foreclosed, and many solutions arrive as benevolent magic rather than results of contested agency. The result is resonant but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—maintaining the library’s equilibrium by keeping extinct feelings dormant—is clearly signaled, and the broken tube is a concrete threat to that stasis. There is a meaningful tightening when the director declares the tube irreparable and the extinction of its source, forcing Lirael into improvisation with her own voice and memory. However, the danger remains largely hypothetical on the page; we never see a near-loss or consequence that truly endangers her or the space, so tension stays relatively low. The resolution is earned and internally driven, but the price paid feels more conceptual than acutely dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Elara’s need to repair trust vs. her pattern of silence—interweaves nicely with the linguistic puzzles, and there is a clear tightening as her archival work forces her to confront her own dammed “river.” However, opposition is fairly soft; Henrik challenges her gently, and Mira answers the phone without much friction or risk of rejection dramatized on the page. Escalation is present but could be sharper if her attempts to reach Mira or translate the sister dialogue met more concrete resistance. The final choice to call Mira is meaningful and forecloses continued avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking an encrypted expression of trust and fear—is clear, but the conflict stays low-intensity and largely uncontested. The volcano’s rumbling and the floodgates’ implied risk never escalate into concrete obstacles that might derail her decoding or force a genuine trade-off. Lira’s method works smoothly; there’s no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options beyond patient analysis. Consequently, the story feels poised and resonant rather than truly tense or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—what Elias will do with the meteorite and what that means for his grandfather’s legacy—is clear but remains largely internal and low-pressure. There is one solid tightening: when the ledger entry about Voss reframes the chip from oddity to key and points toward a concrete next step. However, external pressures (clients’ demands, the risks of smuggling or of contacting Voss) are gestured at rather than dramatized, so Elias’s ignoring of clients and eventual departure feel almost consequence-free. The story achieves a quiet internal escalation rather than a strongly felt narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Lira’s need to decode the maze/terrace and decide whether to cross the threshold to her father—is clear and escalates through pattern recognition, environmental alignment, and the appearance of the door. Internal and external stakes braid well: deciphering codes and grain directly enables her to reach the maze’s heart. However, danger and trade-off remain largely conceptual; she steps through with minimal felt jeopardy or sacrifice beyond the abstract idea that thresholds are not to be revisited. A sharper sense of what she might lose (remaining lost, losing him again, or forfeiting autonomy) would give the climax a more visceral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are largely internal and thematic: Mara’s hunger for belonging and validation of her “impractical” work. The main pressure point is whether the luminous respite will manifest and whether the others will share in it, but there is minimal escalation beyond patient waiting; skepticism is mentioned but never concretely sharpens into conflict. Once the alignment begins, there are no real trade-offs or narrowed options, only wonder. The ending thus feels lovely but low-tension, more like a successful demonstration than a tested stance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled early, and there is one clear deepening when Lira recognizes that seeds might map missing paths. Pressure increases modestly as she moves from workshop experimentation to the geode’s heart, culminating in the choice to dissolve shard and seeds in the pool. However, the conflict remains largely intellectual and investigative; there is little sense of genuine risk, competing obligations, or what she might lose by being wrong or by learning the truth. The realization about “release” is interesting but not sharply pitted against a credible alternative or immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary stake is conceptual—can Lira guide chaos into a pattern—rather than life-changing, and it remains fairly low-pressure. There is a meaningful tightening when she introduces the discordant note, the arcade holds its breath, and the fountain’s lights flare, but no serious risk of failure or consequence is dramatized. Opposition is ambient rather than active; nothing truly resists her plan beyond inertia. As a result, the escalation reads as interesting but gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can renew her constellations and partially reclaim forbidden connection to the “Before” without shattering herself or the ban—is clear, and escalation from dance to verse-writing is a meaningful tightening. The risk of madness, the ban’s pressure, and the physical pain of inscription give the climax some cost. However, options never feel sharply contested on the page; there’s little doubt that she will proceed, and no real friction from external forces beyond atmospheric tremors. The conflict is thus compelling but somewhat one-directional, more about execution than a live dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s desire for insight and affirmation of her worldview—is very low-intensity and faces no resistance. Once she arrives, everything proceeds smoothly: she performs the action she intended, receives the clarity she sought, and leaves unchallenged. There is no meaningful escalation, reversal, or trade-off; no path is foreclosed, and no alternative stance is seriously entertained. As a result, tension remains largely static and the “shift” in understanding feels costless.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reframe his guilt and open himself to a different relationship with time and fire—is clear but gently pressured. The main tightening is his decision to finally open the long-feared box at the ridge summit, and the hourglass’s activation does deepen the internal conflict. However, opposition is minimal; once he opens the box, the hourglass almost immediately soothes rather than challenges him, so escalation feels modest and largely unidirectional toward comfort. The resolution is credible but not hard-won on the page, which keeps tension from reaching a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can she meaningfully shape this liminal space and thus find “equations for hope”—is clear but only lightly pressured. The experiment escalates in a descriptive sense (colors, patterns, needle spinning), yet there is no genuine resistance, cost, or live possibility of failure; Trial Balloon Three simply works. Internal conflict (fear of becoming one of the selves who gave up) never quite bites into a concrete decision she might refuse or botch. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the turn at the launch reads more like a reveal than a hard-won beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Lira will engage with the walls’ “dreams” and her inherited legacy—reads clearly, with one main escalation: the walls’ groan and shifting, which briefly suggests physical danger and metaphysical pressure. Her decision to burn the film strip is the key act of agency that forecloses a path (keeping the relic intact) and aligns her with the walls, but the cost of that act is only lightly felt. The pressure rises more texturally than through concrete obstacles, so tension stays in the “quiet literary” band rather than fully tightening. Strong for a lyric piece, but not yet razor-edged in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can persuade the mirrors to show and seed new possibilities, emotionally bound to her sister’s memory—is clear but remains largely internal and abstract. Escalation exists (successive mirrors, her growing fatigue, then the bells threatening to break the spell), yet each tightening feels relatively low-consequence on the page. There is no sharp trade-off moment where she must clearly sacrifice one good for another; she simply pushes harder until the bells end. The cost of her exertion and the risk of failure could be made more viscerally legible to lift the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether a treaty can be forged in a “forever war”—is clearly stated, but the on-page conflict is largely summarized as generic “posturing, accusations, slow erosion of trust.” Escalation is present in a macro sense (tensions flaring, midday lull, softened hostility), yet there’s no sharply defined turning point grounded in a specific disputed clause or moment of near-collapse. Elara’s interventions feel competent but low-cost; we don’t see a concrete option foreclosed or a trade-off that visibly hurts someone in scene. As a result, the signing reads more like an expected culmination than a hard-won, pressure-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can manufacture a meaningful, quasi-sacred release in the wake of his engineered extinction—is clear but plays out almost entirely internally. There is one main tightening when he chooses to place the egg and then pour the last river water on it, accepting that it may be destroyed. However, moment-to-moment pressure remains low; thunder and storm don’t quite become active constraints, and there’s little sense that he might choose otherwise. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, which works but keeps the tension modest for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing the echoes/defying conformity—is clear, and there is some escalation as the dance intensifies and the threads begin to glow. However, opposition is largely atmospheric rather than active; there’s no palpable threat of failure beyond implied difficulty, and no evident downside if she cannot unlock the sanctuary. As a result, tension feels aesthetic rather than truly pressuring, and her success arrives without a visible trade-off or narrowed option set. The conflict reads as a smooth fulfillment of intention rather than a test.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can practice a form of “ethical storytelling” under live scrutiny—is clear but remains mostly intellectual rather than visceral. Pressure escalates modestly: from private rehearsal to performance to audience skepticism, then diffuses as he cleverly reverses the projection and wins them back. The external conflict (with the drifter and the uncertain audience) lightly tests his method but never truly endangers his goal or self-concept. As a result, the final affirmation of his method carries limited felt cost or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her quiet ritual can meaningfully honor the moth and be recognized (symbolically) by the monarch—is clear but very gentle. Escalation is modest: the time-sensitive construction before sunset and the suspense of whether the butterfly will land on the lattice at all. The micro-climax (the monarch landing and briefly contacting the wing) provides a satisfying tightening of pressure, but there’s little sense of alternative paths or real loss if it failed beyond private disappointment. As a result, tension feels poetic rather than urgent, appropriate for the mode but limiting in dramatic intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—to recover and preserve a lost voice—is clear from early on and coherently pursued through the rope ritual. Pressure does escalate via the trembling hands, creaking ice, intensifying light, and the rope’s shudder leading to Lira’s appearance. However, the conflict is largely one-directional; there’s minimal sense that he might fail, harm himself, or unleash something worse, and he never faces a stark trade-off. The result feels moving but relatively low-friction, with limited visible price beyond physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can understand the nature of paths that “choose” their walkers—is clear but mostly internal and philosophical. Escalation is gentle: the approaching storm and lighting of the seal raise a sense of occasion, but there’s minimal counterforce or risk of meaningful loss if she fails. Her main “choice” is to open herself to the storm and dream logic, leading to insight rather than a pressured trade-off. As a result, the story has resonance but limited tension and very soft on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will engage with or retreat from this “covenant” with the unknown—is legible, and the external puzzle of the tiles provides a clear spine. Escalation occurs via the rumbling chamber, the disembodied voice, and the merging of the tiles, culminating in the mirror-like revelation. However, the conflict remains mostly intellectual and lightly dramatized; there is little concrete sense of what she could lose, beyond a generalized existential comfort, and her acceptance comes without a hard trade-off. The story works, but the pressure could be sharpened by a clearer visible or relational cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether resentment can be released—is clear, but pressure escalates only mildly from visitor to visitor. Most conflicts resolve with minimal resistance: Elara yields quickly, the intervening cases are almost perfunctory, and even Kael’s skepticism collapses after one brightened ritual. The “risk” of cellular memory is asserted but never cashed out in cost, and there’s little sense that failure would truly endanger Lirael or anyone else. As a result, closure is conceptually tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether they can reconstruct the sextant to pursue the runaway dream—is clear, and the story does progress from problem to achieved opening of the path. However, there is almost no resistance or complication: their plan works the first time, with no setback, ethical quandary, or real risk surfacing on the page. Elias’s and the stranger’s agency is thus expressed mainly as execution of a decision rather than choices under tightening pressure. As a result, the conflict feels gentle and largely conceptual, undermining tension at a level that would matter for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—keeping the orchard and its legacy alive—is clear, but the conflict is mostly implicit and past-tense (the breach) rather than actively resisted on the page. The on-page “turn” is the successful mending of the quartz eye and the consequent blooming of the trees, which is more a gentle release than a hard-earned reversal. Lira doesn’t face a dilemma or trade-off that meaningfully narrows options, so escalation feels mild. The persistence theme is asserted more than stress-tested, limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace forbidden, sanity-risking knowledge/legacy—is signaled via the board’s warning and her obsessive drive, and it does progress toward a decision. There is a clear tightening when the cameo shows her older self and when the library of alternate lives confronts her with the idea of choice. However, external and internal pressures remain abstract; nothing on-page genuinely threatens her or forces a painful sacrifice, so the escalation feels more like a graceful unveiling than a true test. Her final act reads as relatively low-cost affirmation rather than a conflicted trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—access to forbidden knowledge that could rewrite Elara’s life’s work—is established early and carried through, with the guardian confrontation as the main pressure point. There is a meaningful tightening when she must “acknowledge their ignorance” and decode the “Silence” shelf to prove her worth. Yet danger and loss remain abstract; the guardian yields after a single successful test, and the idea of balance or price is never cashed in with a tangible sacrifice or threatened failure. As a result, tension is present but relatively soft for a piece aiming at top-tier literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—will Lira find the supposedly mythical garden, and what that means for her identity—is clear from early on. There is one meaningful deepening when the hidden room and seed appear, reframing the garden as something mechanically accessible. Yet opposition is light: Veyra’s skepticism never escalates into a real dilemma, and the world offers no serious counter-pressure. Success arrives on the first try at each step, so tension never truly tightens or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering/preserving lost knowledge and understanding the door—is clear, and pressure does rise as the machinery protests, shadows lengthen, and the air chills. However, the conflict remains largely intellectual and atmospheric; danger is suggested rather than concretely tested, and Elara never faces a real dilemma where she must trade safety, reputation, or sanity against knowledge. The main tightening is the jammed gear and heightened glow as she finishes reweaving, which she moves through without serious obstruction. As a result, the resolution feels satisfying but low-risk, more discovery than hard-won survival or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving sanity and balance in the caves against the energy beings’ invasive noise—is clear and scales appropriately to this length. There is one meaningful escalation when the beings’ hum swells into a “tidal wave” as she works, but she never seriously doubts, fails, or adapts tactics; the conflict feels spiritually intense but logistically smooth. Agency is present in her choice to focus, endure the physical pain, and deploy the bloom to transform rather than banish the beings. However, the lack of real reversals, trade-offs, or moral calculus keeps the tension below elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon/light in a collapsed world—is clear early and tightened effectively through repeated failure and physical toll. Escalation occurs via days of fruitless work → storm jeopardizing her tools and focus → high-pressure adjustment of the shard culminating in the decisive slam into the mosaic. The internal conflict (faith in meaningful coincidence vs. potential futility) is present but soft, and the storm’s lucky moonbeam shoulders a bit too much of the final turn. Still, Elara’s agency directs the key climax, and the world’s change reads as a consequence of her persistence rather than pure happenstance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Lirael remains a recorder of others’ memories or risks seeing herself as part of them—and it is signaled early. Escalation is gentle but present: the thickened fog, elongated shadows, and intensifying hum increase pressure, with time running out as the fog fractures. The limitation is that conflict never bites quite as hard as it could; no concrete external or relational pressure forces the choice, so the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can reclaim fire as something other than destructive, and thus outfly her past failure—is thematically clear but weakly pressured in-scene. Once the note appears, the path to success is near-frictionless: the fortress never truly resists her, and there’s no real risk of catastrophe or rejection to test her resolve. Escalation is mostly a sensory crescendo rather than a tightening of choices with visible prices. The resultant arc feels more like a guided awakening than a conflict truly wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can bridge the rift with Kael without betraying her own way of seeing—is clear but understated. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the “heavier” pause, glowing cicada, and her decision to frame the conflict as a transition deepen pressure without ever making the outcome feel precarious. Her final choice (speak via metaphor, not direct defense) is an adjustment rather than a hard trade-off, and visible cost is minimal. The conflict remains engaging but never truly bites, limiting stakes-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Lila’s need to reach the trellis and savor its silence versus the time-bound danger of inversion—is clear and escalates as the hour wanes. The key tightening is her refusal to let go of the trellis and the resultant loss of the doll, which exacts an emotional price and forces her eventual renunciation of staying above. Internal stakes (claustrophobia vs brief freedom) intertwine well with the external clock. The conflict with the father’s warnings stays relatively soft, limiting the sense of crucible-level pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to understand how silence can comfort—is clear, but remains largely intellectual and unopposed. The only true tightening is the vial’s sudden stillness, which deepens her understanding but doesn’t corner her into a difficult trade-off or visibly foreclose alternatives. There’s no on-page loss, relational tension, or ethical friction that would raise the cost of her final stance. As a result, the “conflict” reads more as elegant meditation than as escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reach the stairway before sunrise to claim the throne and avert imbalance—is clearly established, and pressure escalates through discovery (each mural) and the emergence of the guardian. There is one meaningful deepening when the guardian demands “truth” and “purpose” rather than power, shifting the conflict inward. However, the external and internal trials resolve with relative ease: the murals yield clues on first touch, and the guardian’s challenge is answered almost immediately, without forcing Lira into a painful trade-off or visible loss. The tension works but never quite bites hard enough for top-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—Elara’s self-imposed isolation versus her need to reconnect to save the thresholds—remains mostly internal and is clearly articulated. There is one meaningful tightening when Kael reminds her she burned the bridge, forcing her to own the contradiction and ask anyway. However, resistance is brief and easily overcome; Kael crosses the threshold quickly, and the danger to the sanctuary never manifests in a concrete, on-page test. As a result, stakes feel more conceptual than pressurized, and the cost of her choice is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (prevent the farm’s collapse and their deaths by managing conceptual pressure) is clear and signaled early, and the instability of the crystalline spores is a solid externalization of that. Escalation occurs in one main tightening: the diamonds are about to stabilize/implode, and the device demands a risky intervention. But the resolution (turning the bolt once and everything works) comes with little contestation, error, or visible consequence, which makes the earlier fatal-stakes rhetoric feel inflated. Internal conflict is present but doesn’t fully bite; no option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond “business as usual.”

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth of her dynasty and her father’s obsession—is clear from the start, and the standing-wave experiment is a concrete attempt that escalates pressure. The key tightening is the gramophone hum peaking into visions that point to the hidden compartment, which then forces her to confront letters that overturn her assumptions. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there is little sense of risk, competing goals, or a live alternative path that she might choose, so the cost and danger feel modest. The result is strong but not piercingly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping/static survival vs. embracing and reshaping possibility—is present and escalates through the unsnapping, descent, and orb-shattering. Each major turn is driven by Cedric’s agency, and pressure does intensify as reality destabilizes. However, external resistance and concrete risk are relatively soft; choices feel like following a breadcrumb trail more than confronting a genuine dilemma. The conflict lands more as a graceful initiation than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to find meaning and human connection in erased histories, with the button as a test of whether he’ll engage or remain a passive clerk. There is a modest tightening when the engraved date links the object to emancipation and raises the emotional weight of John Doe’s anonymity. However, opposition is minimal and the brief spike of external tension (the slamming door) dissipates immediately without changing his options. Conflict remains mostly internal and reflective, with little sense that any live alternative path is genuinely foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    External stakes are clear and strong from the outset: obtain proof of erased uprisings under a tight drone patrol clock. Escalation is coherent—three-minute window, underwater infiltration, file transfer under threat, alarms, explosion—but once the drive is grabbed, the escape feels relatively unproblematic, with no hard trade-off between competing goods. Internal conflict is mostly declared (“Indifference kills faster than bullets”) rather than dramatized as a live dilemma. Still, the loss of the relay station as a cost gives the climax some bite.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—prevent the coded prophecy from being fully spoken—is clearly planted via the grandmother’s warning and tightened when the apparition begins reciting it. Escalation is straightforward and effective: from initial low note, to frantic staccato, to full-on sonic struggle as his lungs burn and the figure frays. The cost is mainly physical exertion plus ongoing existential uncertainty, which fits the piece’s scale but feels a touch soft for “world-ending” rhetoric. Still, the conflict coheres, and his sustained playing as active resistance gives the climax credible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ message—remains clear, and the discovery/use of the moonstone dust is a meaningful tightening that allows her to finally succeed. However, the conflict is largely frictionless: once she decides to engage the folklore, nothing resists her, and the storm warning and Lirael name act as information gains rather than sources of immediate dilemma. There’s no option truly foreclosed or price paid on the page, so tension plateaus into wonder rather than escalating toward a hard choice. The result is a graceful but low-intensity arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to find and understand the compass as a way to reconcile his compulsion for order with the lure of uncertainty. We do get a solid escalation—from intellectual obsession to literal physical danger (the fall, near-drowning) and then to an internal decision about what the compass means. However, much of the pressure is gentle; the danger of the fall resolves quickly and the internal conflict doesn’t bite as hard as it could, since he adapts almost immediately to the compass’s ambiguity. The ending choice to plant clockwork flowers is thematically apt but doesn’t feel like it forecloses a costly alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning Lira’s fate and testing whether his craft can bridge seen/unseen—is clear early and tightened by his decision to drop the coin. The escalation comes from the ritual’s success and the limited, fading time with Lira, which narrows his options to questioning and then forced acceptance. However, there is minimal resistance or real risk besides emotional loss; the scene resolves without hard trade-offs beyond losing the coin and accepting mystery. The conflict thus feels meaningful but somewhat low-friction for the level of rhetoric about balance and redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether laughter can truly be integrated into healing without denying painful truth—is articulated, and the meeting with the keeper focuses that question. There is some escalation as the music shifts from dissonance to lullaby and Lira is challenged about her fear, but the opposition is fundamentally benevolent and quickly cooperative. No option is meaningfully foreclosed, nor is there a visible price beyond transient vulnerability. The conflict feels contemplative rather than pressurized, limiting dramatic power.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reframe his torture into a survivable ethic of mercy—is clear but largely internal and somewhat abstract. Escalation comes via environmental intensity (hum, spores) and then the woman’s intervention, which pushes him to crystallize a choice rather than endure passively. The cost of his final stance is mostly conceptual and implied (continuing to move through a space that mirrors his torture) rather than concretely dramatized as risk or loss. This works for a lyric piece, but the pressure never quite sharpens into a specific dilemma with sharply foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a world-anchoring fragment—is clear, and there is at least one tightening beat when the mural’s crack becomes a door requiring precise intuitive resonance. However, opposition and cost remain soft: the ink works immediately, the clues align smoothly, and the shard yields once she matches details, with no serious risk of failure or harmful consequence. The conflict is mostly puzzle-like rather than pressured, so tension plateaus instead of escalating sharply. This keeps the piece from feeling fully tested at a “prestige” level even though the beats are conceptually well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what haunts the elevator and freeing the ghosts—is present but not heavily pressured. Elias encounters minimal resistance: each investigative step yields smoothly, and no choice meaningfully risks harm, failure, or emotional rupture. The ghosts’ restlessness is described but never escalates into on-page threat or moral dilemma. As a result, the story feels more like a gentle uncovering than a tightening conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking total unraveling of library and clouds to achieve an awakening—is established early and escalates toward the rupture. Tension builds as the bottled whisper vibrates, the patrons gather, and the press’s rhythm quickens, culminating in a vivid, kinetic climax. However, Elara’s decision path is relatively untested; she never seriously wavers or adapts under new pressures, so the primary tightening is external rather than a true trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. The stakes are large in scale but somewhat abstractly felt at the character level.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing the Luminari and undermining the Council’s curated history—is clear and escalates from academic dispute to heresy and social unrest. Kael’s agency meaningfully tightens pressure when he chooses the mirror-covering tactic and secretly seeds the fungi; these acts provoke the Council’s reaction and the public’s doubt. However, much of the conflict’s escalation (“The dispute raged for weeks,” “the people… began to question”) is told rather than dramatized, softening visceral tension and the sense of concrete loss per turn. We feel conceptual stakes and some cost but rarely inhabit a sharply focused, on-page crucible scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring the box/stone by confronting buried dishonesty—is clear early and coherently maintained. There is a meaningful tightening when Elias frames the stone as a mirror and demands Lira “admit what was taken,” forcing her into a costly emotional choice. However, the conflict resolves quickly once she voices a single truth, with little back-and-forth, hesitation, or risk of failure, so escalation feels modest rather than bracing. Tension exists more on a conceptual and emotional plane than as lived, escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s quest for untainted petrichor and a locus of the unknowable—is clear and tightened by the expedition’s implied fate and the lagoon’s indifferent presence. Escalation exists (deeper tunnel, heavier compass, surging visions, the “presence”), but Lira is never truly forced into a sharp trade-off; she collects samples and leaves without any hard choice beyond enduring unease. The cost is primarily conceptual and emotional (embracing mystery over explanation) rather than materially risky. It works for a quiet literary piece but falls short of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s need to understand and reorganize the island’s tangled history—is intellectually clear but only lightly dramatized in terms of risk or consequence. The major “tightening” is her stepping through the portal, yet it involves little fear, doubt, or visible price; the storm and isolation never seriously threaten her or others on the page. After the ancestor’s brief admonition, conflict effectively dissolves into a revelation montage, so tension ebbs rather than peaks. The conclusion gives her a new mission but doesn’t force a hard trade-off or sacrifice, keeping stakes conceptual rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to decode the window’s language to answer her grandmother’s question, with a secondary tension between her restoration commission and private obsession. Pressure rises modestly through the discovery of the humming glass and the violet inscription, leading to her reorienting her art around shadow and hush. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal external resistance or tangible jeopardy; no significant option is visibly foreclosed. The escalation thus feels more like steady deepening than a sharp tightening with clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving dangerous truth versus personal annihilation—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s visions, the lagoon’s warning, and the lethal tunnel network to the final decision to destroy access to the codex. Her agency drives the key turns: choosing to parley, to descend despite foreknowledge of her death, and finally to trigger the trapdoor. However, the climax is rushed: the confrontation with the antagonist and sacrifice of the codex happen almost back-to-back with limited on-page reckoning with the human and political costs. The sense of having “just bought time” is thematically apt but could carry a sharper felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving the cove as a way to restore meaning—is clear, but pressure stays low and relatively unopposed. Elias’s “work” spans days and weeks without specific obstacles, reversals, or difficult trade-offs; the town’s awakening flows smoothly from effort to reward. The key deepening (bottle as lens, lanterns brightening, ghosts materializing) reads more like a graceful reveal than a pressured escalation. As a result, the ending feels more like an earned mood shift than a hard-won, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and what the accidental prophecy portends—is clear, but the pressure remains mostly atmospheric rather than sharply escalating. The principal tightening comes when Voss hears the hum beneath the shriek and links it to the foghorn’s silence, shifting the prophecy from terror to warning/awakening. However, he faces little true dilemma; his agency (play, listen, reinterpret, archive) is rarely in conflict with a competing value, so visible cost is low. Tension is present but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully reopening the path without unraveling the atrium—is clear, and the ritual sequence provides a natural escalation from waiting to action to transit. However, opposition is soft: the serpentine creature never truly resists, the vortex’s “hunger” is mostly conceptual, and nothing on the page pushes back hard against her plan. Internal conflict remains muted; she’s resolved and competent rather than torn, and the paradox of decreasing entropy is explained rather than dramatized as a risk. The result is a pleasing but relatively low-friction progression where the outcome never feels genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Lira’s intervention will destabilize or soothe the storms—is clear and escalates once the new tone agitates the clouds. However, conflict resolves with relatively little resistance: once Veyra appears, the path to harmony is quickly articulated and successfully executed, with no real risk of failure or meaningful sacrifice. The internal tension between Lira’s curiosity and responsibility is present but underdeveloped; she never seriously considers stopping or making a harder trade-off. As a result, the pressure narrows options but doesn’t bite very deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Zara’s need to reconcile her spiritual attentiveness with the station’s utilitarian expectations—is clear, and the key tightening is her decision to follow the fracturing star, knowing it will cost her professional compliance. However, escalation remains gentle; beyond missing a report, there’s little felt risk or irreversibility, and Veyra’s opposition softens quickly. Internal conflict does not bite hard enough to force a painful trade-off, so the ending feels more affirming than hard-won. The piece works as a lyric vignette, but pressure is relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elias will continue to preserve silence or risk speaking—tightens effectively when the box glows and the ghosts gather in a more insistent, embodied way. The escalation is internal but clear: from passive watchfulness, to interpretive engagement with the box, to an explicit call to action that he must either accept or refuse. The choice to speak is clearly his and resolves the pressure; however, resistance in that moment is underplayed, making the conflict feel a touch smooth given decades of muteness. There is emotional cost in losing the ghosts and his practiced silence, but it could be made more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering the “texture of time passing” to address a world where numbers have lost meaning—is clear, and the tension is carried by curiosity and existential pressure rather than danger. There is one solid escalation: accessing the capsule and placing the urn fragment, which transforms the situation (mercury stilling, wife’s face, realization about layered time). However, opposition and concrete cost remain soft; things essentially work once he tries the key action, with little resistance or risk. The ending choice (leaving the talisman) narrows an emotional path but could bear heavier on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Lira’s attempt to transform storm-fractured remnants into a harmonious tapestry and thereby validate her practice. The kite string snap offers a promising moment of rupture, but the subsequent pressure remains low and largely contemplative, with no genuine risk of failure or meaningful alternative path. Her choices (to tend, to weave, to accept dissolution) are coherent but never feel contested or costly beyond a gentle sadness. Escalation exists in a soft deepening rather than a true tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciling humans and spirits / restoring the temple’s harmony before she dies—is clear and present from early on. Escalation is modest but real: the rumble signals spiritual displeasure, the dusk wiring is a clear high-pressure moment, and the spirit’s “Why?” / “It hurts” exchange crystallizes the ethical and emotional cost. Lira’s agency drives the peak turn by persisting in the remodel and choosing bridge over withdrawal. The calm, almost meditative tone slightly softens visceral tension, but does not erase it.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Lirael’s drive to debunk/understand the Enclave versus the possibility that “homecoming” can’t be engineered—is clear, but the on-page stakes stay mostly intellectual and affective. The main escalation is her choice to place the amber in the sculpture, which leads to a powerful experiential beat, yet she never seriously resists or risks tangible loss in doing so. Kael’s opposition is more philosophical than obstructive, so Lirael’s path never truly narrows in a way that forces a hard trade-off. Tension is present and grows, but it never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether life and balance can be coaxed from a ruined battlefield—is clear and thematically charged. There is some deepening when bird language sharpens into the word “Khalis” and the storm gathers, reweighting his work as fragile and urgent. However, conflict stays mostly internal and philosophical; there is no palpable risk of failure or concrete obstacle that forces him to change tactics beyond adjusting how he plants. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-tension escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether Hush can transform these relics into communal connection—is thematically clear but only lightly pressured; success never genuinely seems in doubt. Each riddle is solved quickly and cleanly without failed attempts, ethical tension, or meaningful sacrifice, so escalation reads more like a gentle accretion of puzzles than tightening conflict. Hush’s “agency” consists mainly of correct interpretation, never facing a trade-off that forecloses another path. This yields a pleasant, contemplative piece rather than one with gripping stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elio remains in static, self-protective exile or moves toward an uncertain future—is clear and sharpened by the grandmother’s injunction to “find the thread.” The glimpse is an effective escalation, turning passive observation into a call to act. Still, the pressure never quite bites: there’s little sense of what he loses by leaving or what danger he courts, so the trade-off feels largely conceptual. Tension operates more as philosophical unease than as robust conflict with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—prevent the spire’s collapse and save Aetheria—is clearly stated, and pressure does escalate via the groans, cracks, and violent shaking as pieces are swapped. However, Kael’s agency is never meaningfully constrained by a trade-off; his plan works beat by beat without a true reversal that forces a new tactic or reveals a deeper cost. The conflict remains largely procedural and environmental rather than moral or relational, so tension stays moderate even as the prose signals danger. The result is engaging but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can “unbind” the board and, by extension, unbind her own relationship to crisis and history—is clear and progresses. Pressure escalates through her continued walking against the gallery’s whispers, culminating in the king’s fall and the choice to reverse the pattern. The internal and external conflicts align, but the cost is relatively gentle; there’s little sacrifice beyond effort and a conceptual shift, and no option feels meaningfully foreclosed on the page. The piece is tense in a meditative, symbolic way, not a high-friction one.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will risk the pain of remembering to reclaim a sense of home and self—is clear and tightens when she chooses to seed the stone and when the cavern begins to collapse. The major escalation (cavern shaking, rocks falling) forces her latent abilities into action and yields a visible cost (shards embedded, burden of memories). However, the conflict remains largely internal and metaphysical, with minimal resistance once her power manifests, making the climax feel slightly easy. The story earns its emotional turn but could deepen tension with more concrete risk of failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—freeing the village and achieving self-forgiveness—are clear, and the black-thread memory beat is a meaningful deepening of pressure. However, once he engages with the tapestry, the path to resolution unfolds without opposition, sacrifice, or genuine risk of failure. His agency is present but not seriously tested; the climax at the pedestal reads as inevitable rather than hard-won. This keeps tension functional rather than compelling at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Kael versus the elders’ controlling ritual—is established early and escalates through his timed disruption and the confrontation with the coal-eyed elder. His agency drives the crucial turn: choosing “Forgive” as his word and reciting his counter-ritual reframes the stakes from obedience vs. punishment to control vs. shared truth. However, resistance from the elders collapses almost instantly under the spectacle of light, and there’s no tangible retaliation or sacrifice on his side, so the sense of risk and price never quite peaks. The climax is thematically charged but dramatically a bit easy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can wrest meaning and a self-concept of survivable brokenness from a hostile world—is clear and increasingly pressured by external collapse (shuddering workshop, surging sea) and internal doubt. A strong tightening occurs when the statue speaks, challenging her premise, and another when she removes the respirator, risking bodily harm to affirm her new stance. Internal and external conflicts are well-woven: the acid sea as both literal threat and existential void. Stakes remain mostly personal/psychic, but the visible physical risk keeps them from floating into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconcile his sense of fracture with a perception of continuity—remains coherent but low-intensity. The cave’s supposed danger is declared more than dramatized, so external stakes never squeeze him into a hard corner. The key deepening beat is the vision of his mother and the warm, seemingly timeless pool, which reweights his journey but does not force a painful trade-off. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than pressured, effective but not especially sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—proving her theory and letting her true feelings reach the village—emerges early and is maintained throughout. Pressure escalates modestly through the risky experiment and the threat of discovery when Thalos appears, then deepens into a more spiritual tension as she merges her intent with garden and storm. However, Thalos’s immediate support removes the most concrete source of opposition, so the conflict never fully bites in a way that forces a painful trade-off. The cost is mostly emotional exposure and rule-breaking, present but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can reanimate the lost routes and voices—is clear and consistently pursued. Pressure escalates via the failure of automation, the eerie phone instructions, and the all-night build culminating in the noon activation. However, there’s little direct resistance or real risk of failure on the page; once the pattern of calls is established, success feels almost assured. The conflict remains primarily atmospheric and task-based rather than sharply testing her limits or values.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to manage dangerous truth in a traumatized, hyper-empathic world—is clear, and the arrival of Jorn and the ledger is a real escalation from personal foraging to systemic conspiracy. However, most of the conflict is reported rather than dramatized, and no concrete antagonist pressure appears on the page; “they’re coming” remains abstract. Mara’s final decision (“We occlude”) is thematically meaningful but doesn’t visibly foreclose an option with an immediate, felt price in-scene. Tension is present but never quite tight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories of a daughter vs. the cost of reimposing the captain’s guilt—is strong on paper, and the revelation that the Aurora was scuttled provides a clear deepening. However, tension is mostly conceptual and expository; Elias encounters little resistance and doesn’t have to fight, bargain, or sacrifice much yet. His promise to “return them” reads as a low-friction commitment rather than a pressured, costly choice. The conflict works, but escalation feels muted for the thematic weight invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict—whether Lila will step into a transformative, possibly supernatural encounter or stay comfortably stagnant—is clear, and the moment of touching the chip and stepping through the doorway provides a distinct tightening. Yet the stakes remain largely internal and low-friction; there’s little sense of what she risks losing if she’s wrong or retreats. Her agency is present but minimally contested, so the escalation feels smooth rather than pressured. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not particularly tense or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she will confront the source of her numbness/fear—and it’s signaled early via the dreams and the seer’s warning. Pressure escalates via the climb and the uncanny atmosphere, but once the entity appears, conflict resolves relatively quickly through explanation rather than a sustained test of her stance. Her resistance (“That’s… that’s nonsense”) is brief and not truly consequential; she is persuaded with minimal struggle. The ending reads as earned but low-friction, limiting the sense of price or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the nexus from going dark and the city from growing colder—is stated early and tied to Elara’s history of dangerous failures. There is a meaningful tightening when the ledger reframes “palette of resolve” into a tactical principle, forcing Elara to risk another attempt without the old fear. However, the conflict resolves smoothly once the new idea is introduced; we don’t see a substantial new complication or near-failure after that turn. As a result, pressure feels moderate and intellectually engaging rather than viscerally tightening to a hard price point.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s relationship to his past selves and his capacity to “fly” again in any sense—is clear and internally coherent. Pressure escalates via his decision to undertake the climb despite injury and fear, and then to enter the narrow fissure toward whatever waits. However, conflict remains mostly internal and textural, with limited sense of genuine risk or sharply foreclosed alternatives on the page. The final turn is more a deepening of understanding than a high-cost choice, which keeps tension from fully cresting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Lira’s need to decode and gently heal Mrs. Voss’s unresolved guilt, braided with her own loss, and this is signaled early. There is a modest escalation from curiosity to discovery (engraving) to interpretive risk (writing the note), but the risk and cost remain mostly implicit; nothing truly resists her or forces a painful trade-off on the page. As a result, tension stays low-grade and textural rather than sharply tightening around a decisive, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can perform a dangerous, self-altering rune without repeating past failures—is clear and escalates effectively as the ink begins to crystallize. Internal and external pressures (his scars, mentor’s warnings, trembling hands, platform shudder) interweave well, with the key tightening at the moment where the rune might shatter. His choice to proceed, to “shed” and to carve a second rune into the air, provides clear agency-driven resolution. The piece slightly underplays concrete negative outcomes if he fails, which softens the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to reconnect with his dead sister to relieve his guilt—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates from suspicion of a poltergeist to a risky ritual to a direct confrontation with the sister’s voice and the decision to finish the song despite his fear. However, the conflict is relatively low-friction: once the voice appears, there’s little serious resistance or risk of failure dramatized on the page. The cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, which keeps escalation solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusion—is stable but largely internal and abstract. Pressure doesn’t materially escalate; the Witness moves from library to mural to inner cosmos without serious resistance, reversal, or trade-off. The pivotal act (recognizing spiral arbitration as internal) feels inevitable rather than contested, so the cost of the new understanding is muted. Tension is present as a gentle curiosity rather than true jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lorn’s drive to uncover what clocks “really” measure—is clear and developed, and the counting ritual provides a simple but effective pressure structure. Escalation is mostly textural: wind, scent of snow, strange lines in the water, then the massive fjord clock, which does raise the conceptual stakes. However, there’s little sense of danger, irreversibility, or conflict beyond wonder; he’s never forced into a difficult choice or trade-off, so the tension plateaus. The result is a beautifully mounted revelation that reads more as visionary experience than as conflict-tested change.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    There is a coherent conflict—rigid, fearful defenses vs adaptive surrender, mirrored in Kael’s psychology—but it escalates more conceptually than viscerally. The main tightening beats (lights dimming, ominous tone, revelation that the heart is dying) raise abstract stakes without dramatizing concrete harm or forcing a painful trade-off. Kael’s decisive act with the laser pointer resolves both technical and emotional conflict quickly, with little resistance or real risk on the page. The result is structurally sound but relatively low-pressure for a piece aspiring to top-market intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Clara engages with chaos and her grief—is clear, and there is one main tightening when she must choose a direction at the fork. However, the danger around the subway car and fork remains abstract; there’s no concrete sense of what she might lose if she chooses “wrong,” which blunts tension. Her agency does drive the key turn (choosing left informed by her father’s teachings), but the conflict resolves quickly and smoothly once that choice is made. The internal and external threads align conceptually more than they clash under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is emotional and thematic: whether Mara can transform misdirected longing into genuine connection. Pressure escalates via the gravity of the calls (from a man grieving his dead sister to a child in distress to a man dialing a suicide hotline), and Mara’s role as mediator solidifies. However, Mara never faces a sharp dilemma or visible sacrifice; she’s competent and unshaken, so tension stays gentle rather than tightening into a hard trade-off. The ending is satisfying but reads more as affirmation than as a moment of genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and thematic: the unraveling covenant vs Elara’s belief that careful attention can sustain it without sacrifice. Pressure does accumulate texturally (the thinning magic, her unease about legend vs humanity, the troubling photo), but there is no concrete test or escalation where her approach is threatened on the page. The final “choice” is a reaffirmation of her method rather than a decision under duress, so no path feels meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, stakes remain somewhat abstract, limiting the piece’s gripping power despite its conceptual coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—“a cure for loneliness”—is clearly signaled, and there’s one meaningful tightening when the moon rock activates and the ghost demands justification. Yet Elias is never forced into a sharp dilemma or sacrifice; he steps forward, speaks, and then passively receives the ghost’s lesson, with no genuine risk of losing something he values. Pressure escalates atmospherically (light, sound, ivy movement) more than in terms of options narrowing or trade-offs. The result is intriguingly tense but ultimately soft-edged in terms of conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the hidden stillpoint / his mother—is clear from early on, but the path toward it offers little resistance. Each step (glade, thicket, river, map) yields to the protagonist with minimal opposition or tradeoff, and no real reversal tests his commitment. The constellations’ pause ending removes the auditory guide, but the arrival of the map immediately compensates, so the pressure never truly tightens. As a result, the final reward feels somewhat under-priced.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias trying to repair harm he’s caused to the farmer’s daughter and his own belief in his role—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates once the anomaly “reacts” and distorts gravity, and his options narrow when Lira withholds the pen until he accepts a different relationship to control. However, the external resolution (go confess, let the farmer decide) comes quickly once Lira reframes things, with limited sense of real risk or trade-off beyond internal discomfort. Conflict remains primarily internal and intellectual rather than viscerally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can disrupt the harbor’s habitual quiet and reframe silence for others—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening as Lira joins, then as the crowd’s collective silence is “mapped.” However, antagonistic pressure is very soft: no one resists, doubts for long, or imposes a real risk on Kael beyond the abstract fear of being unheard. The escalation is more a graceful swell than a test that forces a significant trade-off or forecloses an option. This keeps the piece beautiful but emotionally low-tension compared to elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake appears to be whether Mara can fulfill her grandmother’s promise by awakening/decoding the archive’s living truth, yet there’s little sense of jeopardy—no guardians, clock, or serious risk if she fails. Her method unfolds with minimal resistance: she moves freely from room to room, leaves her “vandalism,” and the archive responds favorably, so pressure doesn’t noticeably tighten. The emotional peak—the portrait healing into her grandmother’s face—is moving but arrives as a gift rather than the outcome of a tested, jeopardized effort. The story would benefit from at least one turn where her tactics backfire or visibly endanger her goal or self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli will continue to see the entangled memories as a burden or actively participate in them—is clear but remains largely internal and low-risk. Pressure escalates somewhat when the woman appears and insists the memories “need us,” prompting him to literally put his hand in the lagoon and then drum, but refusal never feels meaningfully costly on the page. The choice to drum is a real act of agency that resolves the internal tension and shifts the lagoon’s response, yet no path is visibly foreclosed beyond his prior isolation. As a result, tension is present and coherent, but not especially sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Central Hub under storm conditions while proving a theory about whispers—remains coherent but relatively low-intensity. There is one meaningful tightening when Elias chooses to trust instinct and the strange key/symbol over his well-worn map, leading to the map chamber. However, external danger never escalates beyond mood (no real threat of entrapment/injury) and internal conflict around his quiet strategy is not forced into a hard trade-off. The resolution feels earned but not sharply costly, so tension stays in a moderate band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—soothing the canal’s darkness—is more conceptual than pressured, and it never quite tightens into a moment where Lira must pay a visible price or risk failure. Her tactic (weaving light with the mirror and shutters) remains unchallenged; there is no real obstruction beyond ambient gloom and the fisherman’s brief, low-stakes question. The canal’s “unspoken ache” softening by the end is a nice emotional shift but lacks a clear, escalated test. As a result, tension exists but remains low-grade and relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lila can reframe her father’s leaving and find connection/agency through chess and Clara—is present from her first line and gently deepens. We move from guarded distance to painful disclosure (“He left. Before he died.”) to a tenuous but real alliance (“Then let’s keep planting.”). Yet escalation is smooth rather than sharp: there’s no genuine reversal, ultimatum, or hard trade-off, and losing seven games carries no tangible cost beyond mild frustration. The story sustains tension at a low simmer but never truly tightens the screws.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira clings to a violent, disappearing home or detaches into the unknown—is signaled early and resolved clearly. However, pressure escalates only modestly: the whale is benevolent, the sea doesn’t seriously threaten her, and there’s no significant on-page resistance once she chooses to follow the call. The act of dropping the scrimshaw has conceptual cost but little felt risk or genuine possibility of failure. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than truly testing, limiting the conflict’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Lirael can maintain authentic grief under the happiness mandate—is clear but remains largely internal and static. The “morally ambiguous performance” concept hints at a tension between survival and defiance, yet no enforcement presence, deadline, or on-page consequence tightens that tension in the moment. The scene’s pressure curve is gentle: the spoon’s stages offer structure but not escalating cost. As a result, the ending feels like a reaffirmation of an existing stance rather than a choice made under newly sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric: Lirael wants to dissolve boundaries and reshape the world, and the world fairly smoothly acquiesces. The escalation is textural rather than oppositional (more sound, more shimmer, then ice parting), and nothing truly threatens her or demands a trade-off. There’s no credible possibility of failure dramatized, nor a moment where she must sacrifice something to proceed. As a result, stakes stay abstract and the pressure never fully tightens, even though the pattern of intensification is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain trapped in gray abstraction or risk a dangerous, morally fraught magic to truly “see”—is clear, and pressure escalates through the reed’s activation, the moth’s appearance, and the mural’s revelation. His decision to use pigment again, despite his vow and the unsettling visions, is an authentic trade-off. However, interpersonal and moral conflict stay relatively gentle: Marla never truly resists or tests him, and the phoenix-fire revelation creates no palpable dilemma beyond brief shock. The piece reads more as an initiation/awakening than as a hard-pressed crisis, which limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core pressure is whether Lira can re-enact the experiment and genuinely discover a new way to “feel” connection, and there is a clear tightening when she leaves the lab and confronts the cave. Yet external stakes (danger, opposition, irreversible consequences) are soft, and internal stakes never force a painful trade-off—her hesitation at the cave entrance resolves too easily. Escalation is present (from lab theory to embodied cave resonance) but gentle, aligning with the tone yet limiting tension. The ending’s stance crystallization is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his grief into a meaningful, outward-facing ritual—is clear, but on-page conflict is gentle. The main escalation is the discovery that the projected design casts living shadows, reframing the curtains as mutual invitations rather than a one-way gesture. Still, there’s little resistance, risk, or genuine jeopardy beyond emotional fatigue; most obstacles are implied (his past rock bottom) rather than dramatized. As a result, the ending feels resonant but not hard-won in terms of tested stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how to live and make meaning after systemic financial collapse—is conceptually strong but only lightly dramatized. Conflict is mostly ideological and pedagogical, with little resistance from Mara and no serious test of Elara’s method; the “teaching session” proceeds smoothly. There is one meaningful tightening when “survive” is reframed as “rebuild,” but the shift comes without much felt sacrifice or risk. The result is thoughtful but under-escalated, more persuasive talk than contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will submit to institutional fear of “corruption” or pursue the forbidden pagoda—is clear from early on. There is a meaningful deepening when the pagoda hums, the carvings shift, and the archive floods with light, reweighting her choice to stay or withdraw. Still, escalation remains mostly conceptual; Lirael never seems on the brink of actually stepping back, and the threat of corruption stays abstract rather than forcing a concrete trade-off. As a result, the final stance feels more like the fulfillment of a trajectory than a choice with sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope by addressing the shadow—is clear, and tension builds modestly as Lirael moves from suspicion to recognition to action. However, resistance is low: there’s no real obstacle beyond her brief hesitation, and Thalos removes most informational friction by explaining stakes and tools. The shadow itself never actively pressures her on the page; it “coils” and “hungers” but doesn’t force hard trade-offs. As a result, the climax feels more like a ritual completion than a pressured decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can maintain compassion without being exploited—is clear, and pressure accumulates through her reflections and the meticulous work on the tail. The metaphorical linkage between reconstructing the tail and reconstructing her moral stance provides a meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals. However, tension is primarily internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that she might genuinely choose hardness or nihilism, so the conflict feels profound but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will confront the painful truth of her mother’s death to gain genuine understanding—is clear, and pressure plausibly escalates as each ring leads to more intimate and painful scenes. Her agency shows in choosing to continue deeper into the tunnel and ultimately to touch the suspended hourglass despite mounting pain. The cost (re-experiencing the crash and hospital room) is real but the resolution leans toward neat catharsis, slightly softening the sense of lasting ambiguity or ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering where unused love is stored and what happened to Elise/Thomas—is clear, and the psychometric visions represent an escalation in knowledge and emotional pressure. However, conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative; there is no strong opposing force or hard trade-off that narrows options. The second, more focused reading of the film is a solid tightening beat but still comes without real risk or cost beyond discomfort. As a result, the ending stance choice feels meaningful but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing and “freeing” his trapped creativity—is clear and consistent, and the pressure does escalate from quiet observation to opening a hidden chamber to absorbing the stardust. However, there is little sense of risk or alternative paths; once the sextant activates the archway, each step feels inevitable and unopposed. The key choice (taking and using “The Dreamer’s Unspoken Truth”) arrives without much on-page hesitation or cost calculus, which softens the tension of that moment. The result is a compelling interior experience with limited dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving a fading capacity to dream after apocalyptic loss—is clear and conceptually large. There is one main tightening when Kael is told the sparks are fading and he alone can fix the clock by becoming “occasionally everywhere.” However, opposition is soft: the archive, the dune, and the guide never resist him, and his wave-function transformation happens almost frictionlessly. As a result, the emotional and practical cost of the climactic choice feels more assumed than tested, which mutes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—access to the “wild frontier” of her mind and the nature of the forest’s consciousness—is clear, but pressure remains mostly contemplative. The main tightening comes when she realizes the gear is a seed and must be relinquished, yet her assent is nearly frictionless, with little sense of what she risks beyond a sentimental attachment. There is no significant external resistance or time pressure, so tension stays low-level and lyrical rather than genuinely testing her commitment. The result is thematically apt but dramatically mild.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling the vigil by seeking and awakening unused courage—is clear but remains largely internal and low-intensity. Jorin’s fear of losing the way, the ridgeway’s shifting nature, and the quiet duty to travelers provide tension but never escalate into a true pinch where something might be lost. The main “tightening” is conceptual: realizing courage resides in people and choosing to relinquish the punch and return to vigil. As a result, conflict feels more like a gentle lesson than a pressured crucible, which keeps the ceiling on stakes and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—psychic safety and healing of fragile guests vs. the cost of enforced silence—is clear and sharpened by Lady Veyra’s scream and the healers’ strained hymns. Pressure escalates from routine maintenance to a concrete failure (wobbling bench) that threatens the fortress’s calming function, forcing Elric into a choice. However, the personal cost of his decision to break the contract remains mostly conceptual; consequences are almost wholly positive, so tension softens quickly after the decisive act. The story would benefit from even a hint of real risk or loss attached to his speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—exposing the pretender and reclaiming the realm’s true path—is clear and consistently referenced. Yet escalation is undercut by how smoothly everything proceeds: the Silent Convergence is a nominal clock, the guards never impact her, and the pellet solves both access and unmasking without complication. There is essentially one decisive act (throw pellet), with no real reversal or forced trade-off on the page. As a result, the outcome feels earned in premise but easy in execution, with limited felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering what’s happening to the disappearing paths and islands—is clear, and the institutional pressure (Kael, the council’s “sensor drift” verdict) creates some friction. Escalation from quiet investigation to storm-time revelation to the choice to leave the station is structurally sound, but the material and emotional risks of that choice are underplayed. The conflict remains mostly epistemic and atmospheric; there’s little sense of immediate danger, sacrifice, or competing goods at the climax. As a result, the final decision feels meaningful but not sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the rebellion’s spiritual and organizational torpor—is clear, and the movement from private discovery to public ritual provides a real tightening of pressure. Internal and external conflicts align effectively in Lira vs. despair/skepticism, particularly in her exchange with Jax and the wary crowd. However, antagonism is soft: no one meaningfully resists, nothing misfires, and the hum’s power feels guaranteed, so there’s little sense of what might be lost if she’s wrong. The climax therefore reads more as a beautiful activation than a test that extracts visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clearly signaled—control of the future, regime interest, the danger/promise of the embryo—and Nana’s choice does resolve them in a meaningful way. There is a discernible escalation from curiosity (kite) to discovery (vault, embryo) to choosing a future. Yet opposition remains mostly theoretical: the regime and drones never enter the scene, the digging and unsealing meet no real resistance, and Nana’s internal doubts are muted. As a result, pressure feels moderate rather than tightening to a genuinely testing point.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Lila find a way to live with her trauma without being defined by it—is clear early and tied to her repeated visits to the arboretum. The main tightening comes when the wind rattles the gate, triggering a vivid regression to the bombing; her choice to ground herself in the present rather than be swept away is the key pressure point. The cost is mainly emotional endurance and the acceptance that grief remains, which is convincing but quiet. Overall conflict remains internal and linear, with no major unforeseen complication, keeping the ceiling below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias succumbs to suffocating meaninglessness or finds a way to reconfigure it—is legible, and the “walls closing in” plus his art’s failure provide a clear initial pressure. Escalation is present but gentle: discovering threads, redesigning the piece, and climbing the lighthouse stairs each deepen his engagement rather than throwing real obstacles or true trade-offs at him. His major “choice” moments (tearing the card, reusing the box, arranging the threads) don’t visibly foreclose alternatives or exact a concrete price. The result is thematically rich but emotionally low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering her brother / understanding the time anomaly—is clear, and the discovery of the Tower is a genuine deepening of that conflict. Yet there is little overt resistance: the elders’ warning is static, the ink ritual works at first try, the journey is summarized without hardship, and the Tower door opens after a single gesture. Lira’s commitment increases, but she is never forced to sacrifice something concrete or choose between competing harms in scene. Tension is present conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will break her oath to awaken a dangerous dissident—is clearly defined and resolved. There is one main tightening beat when she actually feeds the letter into the control panel, but after that the tension plateaus instead of escalating; Kael wakes smoothly and aligns with her immediately. The Council, rebels, and public scandal remain abstract, so no on-page opposition or cost pushes back once she commits. As a result, the conflict functions but never bites as hard as the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how Lira will carry and reinterpret her father’s legacy of “quiet” and nonviolence—is present but mostly internal and reflective. There is some tightening as she chooses to bury the scrap and redefine the knife, but these moves aren’t strongly contested by external forces or internal ambivalence. The distant sandstorm suggests danger, yet it never actually presses her into a hard trade-off or forecloses a path in-scene. As a result, tension feels gentle and persistent rather than escalating in a way that tests her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—to stabilize the broken patterns/constellations by catching the goddess’s echo—is legible and gets one good tightening when the goddess begins to “break” and Kael must accept her dissolution as the stabilizing move. Agency is present: he chooses when and how to strike the spike, and ultimately to let her go instead of resisting or bargaining. The external conflict (garden chaos) and internal pressure (sorrow versus focus) are intertwined but relatively low-friction; there’s never serious doubt that he will carry through. Stakes thus feel a touch more aesthetic/intellectual than viscerally urgent, keeping this just below elite tension.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—expose or perpetuate her family’s environmental crimes—is clear and escalates from suspicion to confirmation to public action with real social cost. Her decision to hand over the dossier and then continue advocacy under media and familial pressure demonstrates credible agency. However, the investigation phase feels almost too smooth; we don’t see her face a serious near-failure or a moment where backing down is truly tempting. The conflict works and has weight, but an extra beat of resistance or risk could heighten the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (prevent dissonance from consuming them / redeem silenced cries tied to Lira’s guilt) is clear, and the decision to enter the firmware and read the mother’s letter at the crying’s peak is a solid tightening. However, the path to victory feels comparatively unresisted: Lira faces no serious pushback within the code, and her solution works on the first attempt. The world-scale stakes are gestured at but the on-page conflict remains intimate and fairly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to “interject” and potentially disrupt a fragile, sacred hush—is clear and does tighten as the tile brightens and the whispers clarify. Her eventual choice to fit the shard and then draw on the wall is a genuine turn driven by her agency and revised understanding. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and abstract; nothing truly pushes back or exacts a price once she commits, and the grotto’s approving hum undercuts earlier risk. The result is a thoughtful but relatively low-pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely internal and philosophical: whether and how Elias can “rename” a ruined world through mercy. There’s little escalation; once he has the tessera, the narrative moves toward its symbolic act without any serious friction, reversal, or competing demand. The result is contemplative and lovely but reads more as a meditation than a pressured decision with visible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—mending a fractured timeline so possibility can bloom—is clearly signaled, and there is a recognizable escalation from solitary humming to a full spectral dance that heals the garden. However, opposition is diffuse; “shadows” and “rust and regret” never manifest as concrete resistance or real risk of failure. Elias’s tactics (hum, gather echoes, dance) proceed without serious setback or trade-off, so the tension curve feels gentle rather than gripping. The arc works conceptually but lacks the sharper narrowing of options and visible price that elite venues usually demand.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias will surrender to the recalled pills/recall narrative or forge a more authentic, embodied alternative—is clear but softly pressured. The main escalation comes from his experimental process culminating in the alignment breakthrough with the geode, which deepens the conflict from theory to proof. However, there’s little sense of immediate risk or sacrifice; rejecting the recall/pills is presented as obviously right, so his choice at the end doesn’t feel like it forecloses a tempting alternative. The conflict is thus engaging but relatively low-torque.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the fossil to fulfill her mission as “voice of the unknown”—is established early and followed through. That said, the conflict is largely frictionless: the fossil yields its secrets without resistance, and Lira never seriously doubts or risks anything material on the page. The main escalation is informational and experiential (from reading heat signatures to being flooded with spores and insight) rather than a tightening of options or a true trade-off. The piece reads more as a graceful revelation than as a pressured test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual: understanding history to shape the future, without any tangible jeopardy or visible downside to failure. The main escalation is the echo growing clearer as she sorts the buttons, culminating in the articulated message, but there’s no real opposition or dilemma testing her resolve. Her agency is present but low-risk—she never truly has something to lose by proceeding. The result is a gentle, pleasant pressure curve rather than an incisive one.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will re-engage with the dangerous legacy of her father and her own courage—is clear early and coheres throughout. Pressure is mainly internal, with a small external feint (the creak at the railing), and it does deepen as she moves from hesitation to transcription to a decision to head for the weather station. However, conflict never quite sharpens into a dilemma with a visible price paid on the page; the risk and cost are more implied than dramatized. The escalation is therefore credible but relatively quiet and low-intensity for a piece aiming at top-tier literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes remain almost entirely abstract and internal—clarity, meaning, and honoring a ritual—without an on-page dilemma or visible price. Time nominally doesn’t matter to Thaddeus, and nothing in the crossing materially threatens his goal; the ferryman exerts no antagonistic or complicating force. The “tightening” from fog to rain gutters ticking feels more like a rhythmic cadence shift than real escalation. As a result, the story reads as a mood-piece more than a conflict-bearing unit.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to understand the oasis’s resistance to entropy—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure deepens when the lantern thrums and timelines fracture, creating a meaningful knowledge turn. Yet conflict remains largely conceptual and unopposed; there’s no real danger, moral dilemma, or sacrifice required, and no timeline is truly at risk of being chosen badly on the page. As a result, escalation feels contemplative rather than tense, which limits stakes despite strong coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elias can nudge Mara (and by extension the harbor) toward accepting light after loss—is clear and enacted through his decision to visit her and physically open the window. Pressure does increase from solitary contemplation to direct, intimate encounter, but the escalation is gentle and largely risk-free. Elias faces the possibility of emotional rebuff, yet that danger is more implied than dramatized; Mara yields relatively quickly. The conflict is coherent and satisfying for a quiet piece, but lacks a truly testing beat or visibly paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will define herself by her extinct collective or as an independent self—is clear, but the pressure on that choice is gentle. Escalation is mostly atmospheric (rising hum, glowing sundial) rather than through escalating costs or real alternatives tested on the page. Her decision to write her own story reads as a natural extension of what we’re told she already wants, rather than a choice that forecloses a viable competing path. The conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lila’s fear of never connecting vs. her desire to rejoin the world—is clear, and the choice to confess her deepest secret into an orb is the main pressure point. However, Elara’s gentle guidance and the story’s soft tone remove much friction; resistance is internal but not heavily dramatized, and once the prompt appears, her capitulation is swift. There’s essentially one tightening (writing and releasing the secret) with limited sense of risk or loss beyond brief anxiety. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—countering the tricksters and stabilizing a fracturing community/institution—are clearly established. There is one main tightening turn: Lila commits to the subsonic interference despite uncertainty, then waits for potential retaliation. Yet her solution works on the first try with minimal complication, and she never faces a real trade-off or loss beyond abstract risk, so escalation feels controlled rather than harrowing. The late psychic contact restores some pressure by reframing this as an opening skirmish, but doesn’t rewrite earlier costs.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (seize the key vs succumb to fear and a hostile space) is clear, and pressure escalates from oppressive silence to autonomous organ to spatial distortion. Elias’s main tightening choice—leaping toward the key against his prudence and then driving the compass into the wall—does resolve the conflict. However, the price of success is underdeveloped: the cathedral’s “shudder” and deepening shadows hint at consequences but don’t fully crystallize into a specific loss or sacrifice. The internal conflict with claustrophobia is present but could push him into sharper, more costly trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—reviving a dead case and, with it, empathy for the victim—is legible, but the on-page pressure is relatively low. Once Clara starts drawing, clues appear with little resistance: indentation, handprint, and locket all surface without a serious obstacle, reversal, or cost. Internal conflict (intuition vs. logic, empathy vs. procedure) is stated but rarely forces an agonizing choice; Voss’s skepticism softens quickly. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will risk herself and the station to pursue a possibly real reversal of exile—is set up early and tightened effectively by the worsening jet stream anomaly and evacuation order. The middle discovery of the buried journal and the ancestor’s true intent is a clear deepening that reweights the risk of the rooftop act. External pressure (storm/evacuation) and internal drive (honor ancestor / reveal truth) braid well, though the cost is mostly prospective; we don’t yet see a concrete sacrifice beyond immediate physical risk. A small explicit trade-off—e.g., disobeying a direct order with visible consequences—would lift the escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias will use this power to reshape “never”—is present but remains mostly theoretical on the page. Escalation comes from the intensifying magical response to his playing and the sudden transition to the other space, which is effective texturally but light on true dilemma. Elias never seriously considers refusing or misusing the amnesty, so tension reads as wonder rather than conflict, and there’s little sense of what he might lose. The ending crystallizes a choice but doesn’t yet force a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can break the familial/greed cycle and redirect the founders—is conceptually strong but lightly tested. His plan works almost frictionlessly: placing bills leads to unease and internal conflict among the founders, and there’s no moment where his approach is seriously challenged or forces a painful trade-off. The “tightening” is mostly in his reflection, not in escalating opposition or cost. As a result, tension stays low and the resolution, while coherent, feels low-pressure and somewhat pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stakes—decoding the temple to confront her brother’s disappearance and stopping the erasure of living inscriptions—are clearly signaled. Pressure tightens when Veyra reveals the daily rewriting and that only burden-bearers can read the new verses, forcing Lirael to risk the same weight that took her brother. The decisive act is her stepping into the hologram and opening herself to others’ grief, which plausibly resolves the conflict. Still, the temporal urgency (dawn rewriting) and the psychic risk could be sharpened for a more acutely felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will confront and integrate a buried, incriminating truth—is clear and carries through to the end. Escalation occurs as the vortex intensifies, the seed is released, and the vision first condemns and then complicates her, narrowing her interpretive options. That said, there is little sense of real jeopardy or irreversible consequence beyond the internal epiphany; the lake’s fury and the risk of being consumed by the vortex stay mostly notional. The conflict is solid but lacks a sharper trade-off or visible price paid in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will accept the wounds of both worlds to mend the covenant—is signaled and pays off, with a clear tightening when she confronts her golden-eyed self. Internal and external conflicts braid reasonably: her fear of losing humanity echoes the metaphysical risk of worlds colliding. However, escalation through the middle (walking the reappeared Labyrinth, hearing alternate futures) passes quickly and mostly as texture, not as active tests forcing new tactics. The climax resolves with relatively little resistance or ambiguity, so the felt cost of her decision is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael can transform her guilt into something livable—is clearly articulated, and the ritual (sewing, then eating the fruit) deepens that pressure. The key tightening is the shift from symbolic barter (card) to bodily risk (ingesting the fruit and confronting her entire life in vision). However, the path is fairly smooth: the keeper never resists, the ritual never threatens to fail, and there’s little sense she might refuse or botch it, which keeps tension lower than the premise allows. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than narratively hard, which works but doesn’t fully maximize potential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lenny will remain entombed in shame or reclaim a sense of purpose—is clear early via the TV failure and retreat to the quarry. Escalation is primarily internal: the cloth’s mystery, the Google discovery, and the call to the bassist gradually force him to choose between discarding it as junk or engaging emotionally with its history. External pressure (Gus’s “then toss it”) is present but mild, so the tension never feels acute, just steadily tightening. The cost—risking renewed emotional engagement with a life he’s tried to bury—is legible, though the decision path remains relatively comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing dialogue/understanding transition—is stated and pursued, and the activation of the seed is a meaningful tightening. Yet conflict is soft: there is no serious risk of failure, no antagonist force beyond background atmospheric danger, and no hard trade-off. As a result, the final success feels gently earned rather than hard-won, with limited sense of price or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether one can transform without losing self and preserve wonder in routine—is clear but only lightly pressured. The woman’s hesitation about shedding her skin is the main conflict, and she surrenders to the process with minimal on-page struggle or cost. The subsequent child beat reiterates the same pattern rather than escalating or complicating it. As a result, tension gently rises but never truly tightens; the piece functions more as a contemplative ritual than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will activate this network of trapped hopes and thin the bunkers’ walls—is present but framed more as inevitability than pressure. Conflict is primarily internal and mystical, and aside from the brief “heartbeat of a hesitation” there’s little genuine resistance, risk calculus, or sense of what might go wrong. Once the shell is identified as a key, Elias moves directly to the correct action and it works flawlessly, which softens escalation. The resulting global changes (farmer, scientist, child) are moving but arrive without his choice having been meaningfully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s ability to move from stagnant guilt toward some livable form of self-forgiveness—is clearly signaled and consistently pursued. Escalation is primarily internal but has a legible deepening: each graffiti line complicates her understanding until she recognizes the maps as emotional and chooses to redraw herself instead of the landscape. Her agency is real (choosing to follow the arrows, kneel at the river, map her heart, and then leave), but the visible price of this new stance remains somewhat diffuse. The conflict stays contemplative rather than pressured; more on-page friction or a specific foreclosed alternative would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and pursued consistently, and the deciphering process provides a mild sense of escalation. Still, tension remains largely abstract: nothing fights back, no serious alternatives or failures appear, and success arrives on the first clear pattern read. Without sharper consequences for delay or error, the conflict feels low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—usurping the throne via reality-fracturing music versus a quiet, unburdened life—is sharply framed and the trade-off is legible. Tension escalates from vision of the throne room to the second path in the coffee stain, with the violin’s string-snapping serving as a decisive pressure point. However, opposition is almost entirely internal; no external agent or ticking clock forces the issue beyond mood and metaphor, which keeps the stakes a bit abstract. The cost is felt, but the path to renunciation is relatively smooth, with little genuine risk of reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving Elion’s echo before it’s lost—is clearly defined early and escalates when the chip over-intensifies and the pool begins to fracture, raising the cost from one echo to all her work and the grotto itself. Lirael’s agency drives every turn, and the choice to “embellish” with moonlight and song is a meaningful tactical pivot. However, the resolution comes relatively smoothly once the new method is invoked, with limited sense that she might truly fail, and the personal cost is mostly physical fatigue. The conflict is coherent and satisfying but not yet harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael can find durable peace with her sister and within herself—is clear, but the on-page conflict is very low-friction. Elara’s return with the hairpin is effectively a unilateral peace offering, with the merchant’s guilt resolving the material problem offstage. Lirael doesn’t have to make a difficult trade-off; her acceptance and renewed trust come with little dramatized resistance. The result is emotionally pleasant but dramatically soft, with limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s sanity and relationship to her husband’s “haunting”—is clear, and the chime-unhooking is a genuine turning point. However, pressure doesn’t quite escalate; most beats feel like calm, controlled steps in a procedure rather than tightening dilemmas. Elias never seems in danger of failing or of doing real harm, and Mira’s resistance is mild, so options aren’t sharply foreclosed. The final choice (which chimes to keep) is interesting conceptually but lands without a strong sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central pressure—Elara’s deliberate withholding versus Lira’s mounting need to know—is clear but remains quiet and largely internal. Escalation comes through Lira’s repeated returns and growing desperation, culminating in her decision to throw a stone herself. However, the cost is mostly implied frustration and effort; there’s little sense of risk or meaningful loss if they fail. The result is elegant but gently textured rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the secret of the pulse—is clear but largely abstract, with minimal tangible risk or opposition. Escalation is primarily intellectual: the birds’ figure-eight and the arrowhead’s resonance deepen his understanding without forcing a hard trade-off. There’s no moment where he must sacrifice safety, belief, or relationship on the page; the cost is implied in centuries of failure rather than dramatized in this window. As a result, tension stays gentle and meditative, never quite tightening around a consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering a sense of authentic, non-automated magic—is clear, but the story rarely makes Kael pay a visible price for it. There is one meaningful deepening when the fountain confronts him with childhood memory and the risk of choosing an ordinary garden over impressive relics. However, external and internal pressures remain gentle; there is no serious chance of failure or of turning back to hollow spectacle. As a result, escalation feels more like a guided tour than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will confront and reframe his grief—remains clear and is modestly tightened as he moves from dock to wreck to the pristine inner library. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and largely frictionless once he commits; there’s little on-page resistance, hesitation, or concrete price beyond discomfort and emotional exposure. The escalation reads as a deepening of insight rather than a pressured trade-off, which works, but keeps tension in a middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can parse the prophecy and align with the universe’s purpose—is clear but remains mostly abstract. Pressure does rise mildly (from fragmented static to coherent vision to activating the dangerous-sounding “distillation protocol”), yet nothing tangible is lost or genuinely risked on the page. His “stellar doubt” never forces a hard trade-off or meaningful renunciation; once the vision clarifies, alignment is largely frictionless. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth ramp of understanding than a tightening of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elias can confront/name these fears and reclaim a meaningful role after Lira—are clear and organically externalized via the monsters and the echoes’ resistance. Pressure escalates as whispers intensify, the air thickens, the monsters’ eyes glow, and he must choose whether to continue naming them despite explicit warnings. The conflict remains more metaphysical and emotional than viscerally dangerous, which slightly softens the felt price. Still, his choice to proceed and the resulting psychic burden (“heavy with newfound weight”) constitute a believable narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can recalibrate the bell to stabilize the cosmic rift—is clear, and Marla’s opposition plus the threat of “disaster” provide some external and internal pressure. The long adjustment sequence, cracks widening, and his physical exhaustion create a credible tightening. However, the risk remains mostly abstract, and once his process starts, it succeeds without a real reversal or hard choice where he might abandon or radically alter his attempt. The result is solid but not deeply harrowing escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s choice between remaining a purely infrastructural warden and becoming a warden of memory; this crystallizes when she decides to place her own photo and say, “Let’s start here.” Escalation is largely internal and accumulative rather than event-driven, with the meeting of Elias’s daughter as the main tightening beat. The mention of the failing dam and resurfacing town raises conceptual stakes but never forces a concrete, time-bound choice on the page. As a result, the felt cost of her new role is present but understated rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—achieving a synthesis of logic and intuition before undertaking a reality-altering transformation—is clear, and the choice to risk her hand in the flame marks a real escalation. Internal and external pressures are interwoven in her deciphering of the crystal via the starlings’ patterns. However, opposition remains abstract; nothing in the scene pushes back besides mild physical pain, and there’s no real sense that she might fail or choose wrongly in this moment. As a result, tension builds but never feels sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are declared as enormous (arbor and hidden city at risk), and the need to “revise the patterns before the next lunar phase” provides a conceptual ticking clock. However, on-page pressure remains modest: once Kael recalls the muscle-memory sequence, subsequent nodes fall into place without meaningful setback or near-failure. The main tightening is the initial wrong pattern and then the realization about how to “click” the buckle, but that turn comes early and everything after reads as competent execution. The ending feels earned but not hard-won, with little visible price beyond exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—custody of existence and recovery of emotional aliveness—are clearly signaled and remain central. Pressure escalates from verbal sparring to physical/energetic clash to a higher-risk psychic merger that could “destroy us both,” tightening options appropriately. Internal and external conflict are interwoven, but the victory feels a bit smooth; Kael’s ultimate tactic succeeds without much visible setback or compromise on the page. The cost to eliminating the clone and absorbing its potential strengths is under-explored, tempering the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary stake is deciphering the mystery of the seed and, more broadly, testing his philosophy of puzzles and control. There is a clear escalation in weirdness (rapid growth, disappearance, slime trail) that pushes him from analysis to physically following the trail into the storm. Yet nothing truly threatens Elias, his livelihood, or his relationships; the key discovery is intriguing but low-cost, and no alternative path is meaningfully foreclosed. The conflict functions but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the household’s lost joy—is clear and escalates as his physical depletion mounts and the echoes strengthen. Pressure rises through exhaustion, failing equipment, and uncertainty, culminating in his collapse when the voices finally burst forth. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided: once the tunnel begins to answer, nothing truly threatens failure or forces a choice beyond endurance. The lack of a sharper reversal or trade-off undercuts the felt risk, keeping tension solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara clings to the key/control or relinquishes it to step into an uncertain homecoming—is clear and does tighten toward the toss into the fountain. Her agency drives the main turn and resolution. However, external pressure from the cultist feels limited and the choice reads relatively low-friction; the risk of what the pendant or path might unleash is more implied than viscerally tested on the page, so escalation tops out at “firmly competent” rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will risk hollowing himself out to restore the crozier/interrupt destiny—is clearly introduced and escalated toward the decision to infuse his own essence. The method of successive approximation provides a tangible series of attempts and failures, and the moment he hesitates over the final crack is a credible tightening. However, the external consequences of failure (for the nexus, for others) feel more gestured at than concretely dramatized, so tension rests almost entirely on his internal resolve. The result is strong, but not as searingly pressured as the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the hush to reconfigure the city—is clear, but mostly conceptual and underpressured. Conflict comes from the tower’s systems “resisting” and his need to discard assumptions, yet these obstacles resolve quickly once he decides to dismantle components; there’s no real alternative path or concrete consequence for failure. The escalation beat (ripping out obsolete machinery, blinding light, searing palm) is effective but brief, with minimal sense of risk beyond discomfort. The outcome feels more like the inevitable next step in a ritual than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to merge timelines, completing the passengers’ journeys at the risk of reality—is clear and escalates as the ferry lurches sideways and the whispers become a unified plea. There is a meaningful tightening when the voices say “Let us merge. Let us finish,” forcing Kael to confront the cost of action vs. inaction. However, the internal and ethical struggle resolves quickly, with limited sense of real alternatives or sacrifice beyond the ferry’s loss. Tension is strong conceptually but could use one more concrete, painful trade-off to feel fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara can reconcile logic and magic without losing herself—is clearly signaled, and pressure does rise when the thread erupts and reality dissolves. However, after that point, opposition is largely notional: once in the void, she quickly adapts and succeeds at weaving a door without a true trade-off or threatened failure. There’s no serious alternative path she must foreclose, and the hinted risk to her sanity never materializes in a concrete way. As a result, escalation feels more like a tour of wonders than a tightening noose.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core stake—Lirael’s search for a way to feel grounded amid changing horizons—is present but under-pressured. Escalation is minimal: moving to the edge of the city and Tarel’s question add texture but do not really foreclose alternatives or force a trade-off. There is no genuine loss, failed attempt, or meaningful risk beyond abstract uncertainty. As a result, the ending reads as a soft affirmation rather than a resolution forged under real strain.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—conveying a dead man’s unsaid reassurance to his partner—is clear and emotionally intelligible. However, escalation is minimal: once Lila hears the faint pulse, each subsequent step succeeds on first attempt with no meaningful setback, time pressure, or ethical dilemma. Her agency is present but never really tested, so the cost of failure remains abstract and distant. The quiet tone is fine, but even within that mode the story could use one concrete obstacle or trade-off to deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—recovering some trace of her brother and surviving her own claustrophobia and the flood—are clear from early on and tighten as the tide rises. Her decision to risk using the codex and stay in the flooding room until she gets a signal is a credible, pressure-driven escalation. The cost is largely emotional (accepting a ghostly trace instead of rescue) plus situational peril; physical danger feels intense but never quite at the edge of catastrophe. One more sharpened trade-off or irreversible loss could deepen the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will erase or embrace the error—appears early and is tightened when OBS-7 insists “The system cannot hold contradictions…Choose.” His agency in using the shard and ink to “defragment” on his own terms provides a meaningful turn. However, external pressure is modest and the practical consequences of either choice remain abstract, lowering the felt cost. The tension stays mostly conceptual rather than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—bridging extinct languages via resonance versus the personal and existential risk of invoking the curse—are clear and escalate when the canyon “roars back” and threatens to drown her. Her agency drives each key turn: she initiates the experiment, sustains the hum, then chooses to renounce the diamond. However, the internal trade-off at the climax (power to resurrect languages vs. risk of obliteration/oblivion) is mostly implied; on the page, she moves from fear to decisive renunciation very quickly, so the felt cost of giving up her life’s key tool doesn’t fully peak. The external danger spike is strong but brief, making the internal conflict do most of the work without quite enough friction shown in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s identity and alignment (civilization’s “cold grip” vs. untamed harmony)—is signaled early and tightened effectively when the static begins physically transforming her. The metamorphosis moment is a strong escalation, forcing a real choice between staying altered like the missing or reclaiming her human life. However, the external stakes (what happens to future “missing,” or to the surface world) remain abstract, keeping the pressure more intimate than dire. The cost of her decision is felt but could be sharpened by one concrete loss or foreclosed opportunity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether order or wild beauty will define the orchard—is clearly established and escalates from subtle resistance (soft playing) to direct systemic rupture (statues freezing and cracking). Lira’s agency drives the turns: choosing to test the crack, to keep playing past injury, to switch from violin to shell as a flute. External stakes (the orchard’s fate) and internal stakes (her belief about control vs chaos) move in tandem toward the climax. The conflict is more mythic than morally knotty, but the escalation and price are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is quasi-abstract—can a small, transgressive act heal or at least soften a deadlocked border?—and is signaled clearly. There is a structural escalation from quiet tension at the border to the unleashed storm and its social/emotional aftermath. However, Elias encounters almost no resistance; he decides to use the bottle, acts once, and the world obligingly shifts, with no serious chance of failure or visible downside. As a result, the conflict feels more like a poetic demonstration than a pressured test of values or courage.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elio can find generative meaning and renewal in this ruined, silent place—is signaled, but on-page pressure is low. He finds the halo fragment almost immediately, meets no real obstacles, and the only “test” is whether he will sing, a choice presented without much doubt or risk. The wind bells and secret door promise escalation but deliver a smooth transition rather than a sharpened conflict or cost. As a result, the story reads as a mood piece with light, internalized tension rather than a fully pressurized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor’s need to reawaken dormant stories and alleviate her restlessness—is clear but relatively low-intensity. Escalation occurs when she deliberately locks the library, dons the scarf, and initiates the ritual, moving from belief to active risk, but the risk is never truly dramatized as danger or sacrifice. The portal sequence provides a genuine tightening of strangeness, yet options never feel meaningfully foreclosed. The result is a satisfying but gentle arc with modest tension.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is clearly established, and the anomalous sunrise meaningfully tightens pressure by finally making capture possible. The reversal (“You’ve been chasing me, but I’ve been chasing you”) deepens conflict into a self-confrontation and forces her to relinquish the capture fantasy. However, tension remains mostly contemplative; there’s little sense of risk beyond psychological disappointment, and escalation feels more like a graceful swell than a genuinely narrowing corridor of options. The cost of her new stance is implied rather than rigorously dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing a dangerous, reality-warping idea—is signaled, and the unlocking provides a clear escalation and reversal (nexus shuddering, world reshaping). However, opposition is largely abstract; there is no concrete antagonist or tight dilemma beyond generalized fear vs revelation. The disorientation and burden of secrets represent cost, but Elias never truly hesitates or adapts tactics under pressure. As a result, tension feels more lyrical than gripping, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth/memories bound to the greenhouse—is clear and does tighten as he moves from abstract rumor to concrete pattern to locket and Clara’s voice. However, the investigation proceeds with little resistance or meaningful jeopardy; there’s no real risk that he’ll fail or be harmed, and no hard trade-off dramatized on the page. The key turn (detecting the constellation pattern and digging up the locket) is satisfying but relatively frictionless. As a result, tension stays low-grade and contemplative rather than escalating into genuinely pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The declared stakes are high (a dying village, the possible reversal of exile), but they remain largely off-stage and untested; the story resolves at the moment of decision rather than at a point of consequence. Pressure escalates mildly when the woman arrives and the tea geometry reveals a “convergence,” yet Lirael faces no real dilemma in helping and risks nothing explicit. The woman’s commitment to “walk backwards” is a form of agency, but the cost and alternatives are gestured at rather than dramatized, so tension never fully tightens. The result is quietly engaging but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—saving the orchard’s fading magic—is clearly articulated, and the dissonant waterfall provides a good inciting nudge. However, pressure does not really tighten: there’s no serious risk that the ritual will fail, no competing demand, and no moment where Elara’s resolve is materially tested. Her agency drives the outcome, but the path from decision to triumph is linear and smooth, with little sense of possible loss beyond the seed itself. As a result, tension is more lyrical than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—Mara’s duty to exhume and ground the hush versus her fear of what will surface—is clear and does escalate as the net’s whispers grow and the stormlike pressure builds. Her choice to keep working through fear despite the rising interlaced noise is the main tightening, culminating in the net’s rupture and the key’s emergence. However, the danger remains largely atmospheric: there’s little sense of what specifically might be lost or harmed if she fails, which softens the stakes. The fisherman’s moral conflict is summarized rather than allowed to exert direct pressure on Mara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and “reopening” the chapel’s silence—is signaled clearly and tightened by the discovery of the hum and the stone’s response to holy water. However, pressure is relatively low; Elias never risks much or faces a credible threat, and no option is sharply foreclosed. The main reversal (stones parting to reveal the staircase) feels more like a reward than a costful turn. Tension exists, but it’s gentle and mostly atmospheric rather than truly testing his values or resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake is internal and conceptual—how Elara will relate to death, memory, and her mother’s absence—and the story coherently builds pressure as she decodes the tape. There is a clear tightening when the hum’s frequency matches the tuning fork and snow globe, forcing a reinterpretation of Earhart’s “last transmission” and of Elara’s own research. However, escalation remains largely intellectual and contemplative; there’s little sense of risk, loss, or alternative paths foreclosed on the page. The final commitment to a new understanding feels meaningful but low in concrete on-scene cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can externalize his unspoken needs without speaking—is clear but remains low-intensity and largely internal. There is some escalation as he moves from Lira to his dead brother to himself, with the storm mirroring this deepening, yet no beat truly forecloses options or forces a painful trade-off. His agency is steady rather than tested; he never seriously considers not encoding or choosing a costlier path. As a result, the piece has tension of mood more than tension of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain a tidy, obedient servant or engage with the forbidden emotional/intellectual legacy of the captain—is present but kept relatively gentle. Escalation occurs via knowledge: the diary/goggles reveal that the captain chose his fate, and Mara must decide how much of that charged truth to place in the widow’s hands. However, no option feels truly dangerous; there’s little sense that silence, revelation, or defiance would cost Mara more than awkwardness. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lila can affirm the meaning of her work and grief in the face of professional dismissal and literal drift—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. Escalation comes mostly from intensifying perceptions of clouds and the revelation that the tower has vanished, rather than from a concrete narrowing of options or a hard trade-off. Her final decision to “go wherever the clouds take us” is a stance crystallization but doesn’t visibly foreclose an alternative path on the page. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle and never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the guild’s legacy under a demolition deadline—is clear and escalates through the discovery of deeper secrets and the literal countdown to impact. The journal’s revelation reframes her task from mere documentation of decay to active preservation, a strong mid-story tightening, and the wrecking ball’s first blow is a well-timed external spike. However, her internal and ethical conflict (duty to commission vs. clandestine safeguarding, risk vs. obedience to the crew) could be sharpened to show a more painful trade-off at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Lira will obey safety and hierarchy or risk herself to pursue a potentially world-altering discovery—is clear and escalates from idle curiosity to a literal leap into the unknown. Her decision to jump is a meaningful tightening that forecloses retreat and defies the captain’s authority. However, tension around that leap is undercut by how smoothly it plays out: the portal forms, supports her, and returns her without mishap, leaving fear and danger more implied than felt. There’s minimal complication or reversal once she decodes the pattern, so pressure rises once but doesn’t twist.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the gear assortment to enable future celestial repairs—is clear but never feels truly endangered on the page. The main “obstacle” (locating the odd reflection and using the vial) is solved without resistance or reversal. Internal stakes about living up to his father’s legacy are present but not sharply tested once he acts. Escalation is more procedural than pressured, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—save the arches/nebula or lose the planet’s hope and orchards—is clear and high. There is one main tightening when the messages finally spur a coordinated gathering under the largest arch. However, the work of saving the arch proceeds without reversal, real risk of failure, or explicit price; the “hours” of labor are summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. As a result, the escalation curve feels modest and the victory a bit unearned in terms of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—ensuring the world ends as a lullaby rather than a scream—is clear and scales down convincingly into Mara’s concrete choices with the pane and puppet. Pressure escalates via the pane’s activation, the global response (clocks softening), and the visible breaking of irreplaceable tools. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but the story never quite forces a stark trade-off or reversal beyond “succeed gently vs. fail catastrophically,” which remains abstract. The emotional and conceptual cost is felt, though not sharply contested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—save the traveler without incurring the curse’s punishment—is clear and tight, and pressure escalates through the birds’ increasingly aggressive passes and the race to the fountain. Kael’s agency drives turns: choosing to keep marking paths despite risk, opening the door, and physically shoving the traveler to safety. However, he emerges without any immediate, concrete consequence beyond conceptual risk, so the cost feels more like a continued sentence than a sharp new loss. The structure provides solid escalation but could use one more tangible price paid in the climax to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue in isolating grief or risk reconnecting with Mara—is clear from early on. Pressure deepens when Mara texts about their mother’s violin and Elara must decide whether to enter the emotionally fraught studio space. However, once she says “On my way,” obstacles fall quickly; the conversation and musical harmony proceed with minimal friction or backsliding, muting escalation. The later “weeks later” ritual and career shift feel more like epilogue than additional tests of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to understand how and where stories begin, temporarily pressured by the man’s unsettling request for a story that “hasn’t happened yet.” That encounter is the one clear tightening beat, but after he leaves, tension largely diffuses into reflection. The later return of the glimmer is graceful but low-pressure, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. As a result, the piece is lovely but reads more as contemplative vignette than full conflict arc at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Nessar will risk subsuming stored remorse to lighten the fortress’s burden—is clear and escalates logically as he moves from vials to the pool itself. The guard’s near-intrusion and the pavilion’s “emotionally contagious” danger add pressure but are underused; they never quite force a sharply constrained choice. The key turn is his decision to submerge deeper and accept the founder’s guilt, which is well-motivated and carries a credible internal cost. Overall tension remains more meditative than acute, which slightly flattens potential intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily symbolic and communal—mending a silence between groups through mending a machine—but they remain abstract and largely untested in concrete terms. The “resistance” (a trembling, inert weight) never credibly threatens failure, and the villagers accept Elara’s invitation without friction, so pressure does not meaningfully tighten. There is one clear deepening when the tower and elevator seem to respond and the weight begins to glow, but no real option is foreclosed and no price is paid. The conflict thus stays gentle and foregone, aesthetically pleasing but dramatically undercharged.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can reshape the mirror without losing himself in the memory feedback—is clearly established. There is one meaningful tightening when the foreign memories flood him and the headband’s loop threatens to overwhelm his own identity. However, escalation plateaus quickly: adjusting the dials resolves the danger with little consequence, and no option is foreclosed beyond a momentary scare. The conflict remains engaging but doesn’t extract a substantial price or force a difficult choice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (recovering the “seeds of vigilance”/key before gravity reasserts itself) is clear, and the inversion mechanic does create at least one meaningful turn when the chamber transforms. Yet the path from entrance to success is almost entirely unchallenged: the fork in the tunnel is resolved by effortless intuition, the manuscript yields the map without real resistance, and the alcove is found without competing options or threats. Because no serious alternative or sacrifice is dramatized, the pressure never fully tightens, and the ending feels more like a successful retrieval than a tested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can coax music from a world gone silent—is clear and tracks through the entire piece. Escalation comes via the physical toll of repeated strumming and the eventual breaking of the insulator, which narrows options and forces a one-shot climax. However, the pressure remains gentle: there’s little articulated risk of failure beyond exhaustion and tool breakage, and success feels somewhat inevitable rather than genuinely in doubt. Still, the insulator’s shatter and brief eruption of sound function as a meaningful tightening and paid-off risk.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can Alaric decode and renew the covenant before the eclipse phase?—is clear and threads the piece. Escalation exists (the hum deepening, the stone glowing, images, the mage’s appearance) and each step narrows uncertainty, but opposition is soft and success feels almost inevitable once the magic starts working. Alaric’s key choice (using Lira’s key to open the stone, then planting the seed) is aligned with his values but not sharply conflicted against a rival path. As a result, tension is present but gentle, more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—whether Lirael can access and reinterpret her grandmother’s silence—remains mostly internal and gently drawn, with the lock as a modest external obstacle. The attempt-failure-adjustment sequence with the clasp and humming supplies a single clear tightening, but there’s little sense of risk beyond mild frustration. Once the lock opens, conflict largely evaporates into summary-like reading rather than dramatized emotional friction. The ending reframes her understanding but doesn’t demand a difficult trade-off or visibly painful renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central pressure—can Lira nurture a feared corpse flower to harmonize a restless village—is coherent, and her shift from forcing growth to patient presence is a genuine escalation in internal stakes. External opposition (the elders’ warnings) is light and mostly rhetorical, receding quickly instead of evolving into sharper tests of her commitment. The seed’s long dormancy and eventual crack provide a clear tightening, but the sense of what she tangibly risks losing beyond pride and a hope for harmony is faint. As a result, the climax satisfies but doesn’t fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the source of the planet’s resilience and deciding how to respond to it—is legible, and pressure does increase as gravity wavers and the arrow tip reacts. However, on-page danger to Lira is muted, and the potential catastrophe of “gravity inverted forever” resolves with almost no resistance or sacrifice. Her choice to activate the pedestal feels relatively low-risk, and the subsequent decision to “guard the gathering” isn’t shown to foreclose any serious alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the crash and locating the engineer under dangerous conditions—is clear, and pressure does rise with the anomalous gusts and the risky climb. Yet Anya rarely faces a true dilemma or trade-off; she simply proceeds through obstacles, and the engineer’s discovery isn’t contested or costly beyond physical effort. The escalation turns on external hazard rather than deepening conflict between competing values. The result is engaging but not fully tense at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that wonder is essential by freeing the cavern’s voice—is clearly signaled, and pressure does increase as Lira moves from oppressive silence to the act of singing. The main tightening is the moment her song actually begins to affect the ice and reach Veyra, creating a tangible risk/reward pivot. However, there’s little articulated cost or credible chance of loss; the silence never actively resists her, and no meaningful option is foreclosed. As a result, the conflict reads more as an elaborate unveiling than as a truly tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can use the flute to confront and transform his failures rather than be ruled by them—is clear from the outset. Pressure escalates from playing in a dangerous liminal place to opening an impossible staircase to a chamber where he’s forced to witness his worst defeats and literally breaks the object he’s sworn to guard. The reversal (the flute’s power residing in silence, not sound) reframes his tactics and forces a costly shift in stance. Stakes remain largely internal, so the sense of danger never reaches the intensity the setting might allow, but they are coherent and scaled appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s attempt to treat emotion as a solvable system—faces a real on-page test when the experiment overwhelms him and threatens his detachment. Pressure escalates from controlled procedure to loss of control (the press running wild, memories and foreign feelings flooding him). His eventual acceptance of the shard and his own tears resolves the internal conflict by renouncing a path (pure analysis), with a visible psychic cost. The consequences and future implications could be shaded in a bit more to heighten the sense of lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is primarily internal: Kail’s fear, doubt about Veyra, and unease with the relic’s vibrations. The arrival of the hooded woman and the demand to “germinate this” provide a clear inciting pressure and a single tightening choice point. However, there’s minimal sense of risk or downside; nothing concrete opposes the planting, so the decision doesn’t visibly foreclose a competing good or avert a harm. As a result, conflict feels gentle and contemplative rather than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—proving the theory to secure self-belief and mentor validation—is clear, and it tightens when the experiment “works” too well and then literally shatters. The decisive turn (glass breaking/realization) is effective, and the cost is her relinquishing a cherished belief about herself and the world. However, the pressure remains mostly internal and somewhat moderated; there’s limited sense of real risk or consequence beyond her mindset. The conflict scales one solid step but never truly corners her.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking the raveling silence / carrying the bead’s message—is established early and escalates via Mara’s increasingly intense attempts to solve the puzzle. The assembly process, with vanishing pieces and the crow incident, provides credible friction and shows her persistence. The final choice to let go of the ancestral bead in order to send the message across distance gives the conflict a real price and a satisfying narrowing of options. The inner tension between her attachment to the bead and her drive to help others could be dramatized more immediately in the climactic moment rather than mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reviving a dying world) is clear early, and the decision to enter the mines against social pressure provides an initial tightening. The on-page trial with the shards escalates physically, but Jorin’s endurance plays as straightforward heroism rather than a real dilemma—there’s no moment where an alternative path or serious temptation to retreat is meaningfully felt. Because the shard fusion happens automatically once he endures, his agency in the climax is reduced to “stand there and take it,” and the ethical or emotional calculus stays simplistic. The consequence is that the resolution feels earned in structure but light in visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to pursue dangerous, forbidden truth or renounce it—is signaled early through the shard’s pull and his mother’s warning. Pressure escalates credibly with the involuntary jump and the unsettling meeting with the not-quite-mother, culminating in the decision to discard the shard. However, external consequences of either choice remain abstract; the cost is more conceptual than embodied, which softens the felt tension. The “world doors must stay closed” frame is effective but could benefit from one sharper, on-page glimpse of what’s at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving a sense of safety and meaning when the literal light fails—is clear but handled very gently. Pressure does increase a bit as the chain of notes continues and his emotional investment grows, culminating in his realization of why the rituals matter. However, the loss of the lamp never forces a concrete, high-cost choice (no ship in peril, no authority bearing down, no clear alternative path refused), so escalation feels mostly conceptual rather than tense. The resolution is earned but low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can she shape/understand this “different” dawn via the lantern—is signaled early and followed through, with escalation when the shadows become alive and the oily darkness appears. However, the pressure remains mostly conceptual; there’s no clear on-page consequence if she fails or misinterprets the vision, and her agency is never seriously contested. The “tightening” is essentially: more intense visuals → she decides she’s ready, which feels relatively frictionless. This leaves the conflict competent but mild for a piece aspiring to top-tier literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what Lin will do with this new post-transplant sensitivity and her dangerous talisman—is clear but under-pressured. The key “tightening” is her choice to deploy the wing despite her longstanding caution, and then to live with its loss as she reorients her life’s work. However, there is little active resistance, competing demand, or real dilemma beyond internal curiosity vs. caution, so tension stays moderate. The cost of her choice (losing the wing) is present but emotionally underlined more in theme than in dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal—Elias’s desire to understand the tower’s sorrow and the trees’ witnessing—with almost no antagonistic force. The pin sound, storm, and “presence” behind him hint at danger but never force a substantive choice or exact a price. Escalation is more a deepening of wonder than an increase in pressure; he moves from corridor to wall to root-hallway without significant resistance or risk. As a result, the conflict feels too soft for high-tier publication despite the strong conceptual scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dying realm—appears early and the song-ritual is a clear tightening beat, but the conflict is largely one-sided: there’s no counterforce beyond ambient ruin. Once Lira starts humming, results cascade without credible risk of failure or reversal. Her exhaustion and the enormity of the ongoing work are a cost, yet they remain gentle in tone relative to the grand scale asserted. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful swell than a pressured, narrowing path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Eleanor’s willingness to confront her grief and legacy versus remaining in emotional hiding, signaled early and carried through to the end. There is a clear deepening when the blank book turns the invitation into a map and again in the mirror chamber, which forces her to face alternate selves. Yet the conflict stays largely internal and contemplative, with minimal resistance or concrete risk; decisions come relatively easily once options are presented. The result is a convincing but low-intensity escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary tension is internal—how Elias will relate to subtle shifts in reality and whether he’ll engage or withdraw—and the impossible bread / living garden sharpen that question. However, he never faces a genuinely hard trade-off or a path that must be visibly sacrificed; once he decides to plant, everything flows smoothly, and the woman’s arrival affirms rather than complicates his trajectory. The sunflower-seed substitution introduces a nice turn, but the cost is framed as “fragile hope” rather than a concrete loss. Overall, pressure deepens but doesn’t quite tighten into a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—save the library’s magic/knowledge from oblivion—is clearly established and remains coherent throughout. There is escalation from the incomplete, fading couple’s vow to the stronger but still unstable warrior’s vow, with time pressure implied by the fading illusions and encroaching dawn. Yet the conflict never feels genuinely knife-edge; her methods mostly work as intended, and dawn’s arrival eases tension rather than testing her with a costly trade-off. The piece has real pressure but lacks a truly consequential reversal or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing the device’s sale—remains coherent and escalates from gathering information to a direct encounter with the buyer under deadline. The key tightening is the device playing her father’s betrayal, forcing her to choose between preserving potentially revealing evidence and destroying the threat; smashing it is an earned, costly stance. Internal conflict could sharpen further if her temptation to listen or bargain were more on the page, but what’s here works. Sentence- and beat-level tension are well sustained, particularly in the tower sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Kael learning what the compass really senses and what “weather-carriers” mean—gets one meaningful escalation when the compass shifts to the bluff and the ground rumbles, culminating in the bloody taste. Yet Kael faces little agonizing choice; his key decision (coming to the bluff) occurs before the story opens, and after that he mostly endures and listens. The revelation that the trees are releasing the world’s pain hints at vast stakes but remains abstract and untested on the page. Tension is present but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The main stake—whether Elias will confront and release his suppressed creativity—is clear, but the pressure around it stays mostly internal and low-key. There is a mild tightening as he moves from painting to the appearance of the door-shadow to fitting the lock, yet he encounters little meaningful friction or serious doubt in that sequence. The act of unlocking feels symbolically charged but practically easy, with minimal sense of what might be lost or at risk if he fails or turns away. As a result, escalation is present but not especially sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering her mother’s last words—is clear from early on and drives Elara through physical and social hazards to the Archive. Pressure tightens effectively when the quill wilts, exposing the stranger as a liar, and again when the Archive is reframed as AI fuel and “empty” echoes. However, external danger (plants, toxic city) is quickly neutralized and the ethical/emotional conflict (truth vs consoling illusion) resolves with relatively low on-page struggle; her acceptance feels swift. The cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, keeping escalation solid but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding and sharing a space where “symphonies of truth” can exist in a noisy world—is clear but never seriously threatened. Escalation is mostly temporal and textural as the iceberg melts, with no real possibility of failure or moral trade-off on the page. The melting provides a gentle tightening (one last droplet, then transformation), but Elara never has to choose between competing goods or pay a difficult price. Tension remains more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the leaking fears from overwhelming Clara and destabilizing the farm—is clear, and the magnetic storm provides a situational squeeze. There is one main tightening: recognition that the box’s seals are failing, forcing an immediate experiment with the controlled burn. However, there are no real setbacks or serious alternatives; the burn and miniaturization work on the first try, so pressure doesn’t truly escalate, it just resolves. The internal and external stakes stay somewhat abstract, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the mailbox’s secret—is clear early, and there is a meaningful tightening when Clara realizes the lock is a combination and links it to the locket dates. However, opposition is very soft: nothing seriously resists her beyond simple ignorance, and her week of gathering stories proceeds without real setbacks or competing obligations. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than gripping, and the emotional cost is largely located in the discovered backstory, not in Clara’s own difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stakes—retrieving the antidote/legacy before the security systems stop him—are clear, and there is a solid escalation from puzzle-solving to physical threat. Kael’s agency drives each tightening: choosing to mirror the dance, interpret the verse physically, and confront drones by dancing instead of fleeing. However, the confrontation with the drones resolves swiftly and almost elegantly, with minimal sense of sacrifice or irreversible loss beyond generic risk. As a result, tension crests but doesn’t quite bite as deeply as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering where deleted memories go—is clear early and remains coherent through to the end. There is one recognizable escalation when the gravity pockets flare, the ground shifts, and Elias must cling to the wall and follow the coffee pattern into the tunnel. However, beyond that, the piece lacks a sharp tightening or trade-off: he doesn’t risk forgetting more, face a choice between his own memories and others’, or confront a cost to using the chamber. The conflict resolves by relatively effortless discovery rather than a pressured decision with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    High stakes are declared (a storm in the stars, the haven’s potential unraveling), but on the page the conflict is nearly frictionless. The summoner’s ritual proceeds without real resistance, doubt, or risk, and the hush responds on first attempt. There is one mild tightening—when the wing begins to glow and tremble—but no serious threat that her goal might fail or cost her something meaningful. The result is tension that feels conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—whether to awaken the library/accept the true story behind it—is present but more conceptual than visceral. Conflict escalates from mild social tension and withheld truth to a joint, quasi-occult act, yet Elias encounters little real resistance (internal or external) once the woman explains. The tactic of “lying to the building” is a nice twist but isn’t dramatized as morally or practically fraught. As a result, tension simmers rather than tightens into a sharp, costly dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—will she continue to hoard quarantined pain or risk re-experiencing it to transform herself—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure tightens when she hears her younger voice and chooses to complete the shell-circle ritual, foreclosing the option of staying safely numb and preserving the garden. However, her internal resistance at that moment is relatively low; the conflict reads as a smoothly accepted catharsis rather than something she nearly refuses. A more visible clash between fear of re-injury and desire for change in the ritual beat would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she will complete and consecrate this act of “calibrated treason” to offer future peace—is clearly signaled. Pressure, however, is almost entirely internal and contemplative; there is no real obstacle, reversal, or tightening beyond the emotional weight of pricking her thumb and finishing the final stroke. Her choice to place the scroll in the redemption niche rather than keep or destroy it is meaningful but not presented as contested. As a result, tension plateaus into lyric meditation rather than escalating conflict with a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why some voices echo—is signaled clearly but remains largely intellectual, with little tangible or emotional jeopardy attached to success or failure. Pressure does increase gently as the shell hums louder and the vision-images arrive, yet there’s no significant opposition, dilemma, or risk of loss; the hooded figure answers his question almost on request. Kael’s main “choice” at the end—to embrace his role and keep singing—is thematically coherent but not contested by any viable alternative. As a result, escalation feels modest and the resolution relatively low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—helping the sailor and his descendants find peace—is clear but remains largely conceptual and uncontested on the page. The sequence of three dreams offers a kind of deepening, yet each arrives with minimal friction, and Kael never seriously risks failure or misinterpretation. His final tactic is chosen freely rather than under pressure, so escalation feels more like accumulating vignettes than tightening conflict. Emotional stakes are present but not sharpened into hard trade-offs or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially epistemic: whether Kael discerns some deeper pattern/meaning in the world’s “hidden effort.” Pressure does increase slightly—from idle mending to following the whistle to decoding the fireflies—but this is more curiosity than conflict, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. His agency manifests mainly as attention rather than a choice with price, so escalation under any lens remains very mild. The ending is satisfying as mood, but not as a test of value or nerve.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—contain or risk the stillpoint’s reality-warping effects—is clear early and escalates logically through discovery, descent, and the pedestal choice. The meaningful tightening comes when she realizes the flawed diamond is a decoy and that sealing the true stillpoint demands sacrifice. However, much of the conflict stays conceptual; the story rarely forces Mara into a truly agonizing trade-off on the page beyond a quick hesitation. The cost is present but somewhat abstracted, so pressure is strong but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is largely internal—whether Kael will remain a passive receiver or embrace an active, prophetic role in relation to the storm. There is some escalation (voices strengthening over years, storm intensifying, mechanism activation), but pressure remains abstract and low-friction; little on-page resistance meets his choices. The “storm as language/blueprint” insight comes without a genuine test that might cost him something concrete. As a result, the final “stance crystallization” feels interesting but not truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s search for purpose/redemption through sound, signaled early and followed through. There is some escalation—the risk that the music box is inert gives way to discovery, then to public sharing—but once the first jar works, resistance largely disappears and events unfold without real opposition. The external “conflict” in the village is minimal; everyone is receptive, coins pile up, faces soften. This makes for a lovely mood piece but keeps tension and cost below what a top literary market would expect.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the key’s balance against malevolent disruption—is legible from early on and carried through to the end. Pressure escalates via the ghost’s appearance and the sonic duel, where Elias risks physical and mental overwhelm to match the key’s frequency. However, there’s limited sense of trade-off or true narrowing of options beyond “stand firm and tune correctly,” and the ghost’s turn to understanding happens quickly, softening the perceived cost. The conflict works, but it stops short of feeling truly harrowing or ethically knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—aligning the viaduct’s power—is clear, but pressure is relatively gentle: one failed attempt leads to a slightly more careful second try, which then succeeds without serious jeopardy or sacrifice. Escalation is more about deepening texture (filings’ changing patterns, increasing hum) than narrowing options or heightening risk. Internal conflict between impatience and patience exists but is quickly resolved once he recalls the elders’ mantra. The revolution frame suggests larger stakes, yet those stakes are not concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Mara uncovering whether deaths were truly “preventable” and freeing herself from Cole’s control—are clear from early on and do tighten as she discovers the “Eliminate” files and Cole’s past use of the lantern. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided, with her self-doubt giving way to a resolve to act on her own terms. However, opposition remains entirely offstage and the story is driven more by information reveals than by active pushback, so pressure escalates conceptually rather than viscerally. The final choice has weight but lacks a concrete immediate price or visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    The main stake—whether Marcus will endorse a program that claims to rehabilitate inmates—is clear, but pressure is mild and largely uncontested. There is one meaningful deepening when he sees and hears the story of the clockwork heart, which shifts his stance. Yet nothing meaningfully pushes back; no credible counter-stake or real risk forces him into a painful trade-off. The resulting conflict reads contemplative and low-intensity rather than sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the yearning algorithm to ring the unheard bell—is clear, and pressure does tighten when the workshop shudders and the acid mist encroaches, forcing her to launch now. The escalation from lab work to literal leap into a deadly environment is effective. However, once airborne, the conflict is largely descriptive; the flight to the bell and the final throw face no genuine reversals or hard trade-offs. The ending reads more as graceful fulfillment than a choice under acute pressure, with danger gestured at but never biting.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the erased truth versus being silenced—appears early and remains focused. Pressure escalates credibly from quiet research to uncovering Project Lazarus, to the explosive implication of the gateway deleting people, to immediate physical danger when Hale and the drones arrive. Lira’s choice to upload the coordinates into her neural implant while under threat is a meaningful narrowing of options, effectively foreclosing safety. The cost is implied rather than dramatized—her likely fugitive status and danger are clear, but we don’t yet see a concrete sacrifice beyond risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—quieting a storm of collective fear by restoring empathy—is clear, and there is one main tightening as Elara confronts the storm’s onset and commits to the mirror ritual. However, conflict is largely uncontested; no opposing force meaningfully complicates her plan, and her competence is never seriously tested. The resolution arrives without a reversal or visible trade-off, so tension feels more ceremonial than fraught even at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant on-page stake is the trapped scientist’s survival, with Lila’s latent will-to-die vs. will-to-act running underneath. There is a clear tightening when the eerie sound leads to the glowing fissure and the discovery of the boat, but the actual rescue proceeds with few obstacles once the team engages, so external pressure never feels severe. Internally, Lila’s euthanasia aim is not put to a concrete test; saving a life doesn’t obviously endanger or complicate her own plan. As a result, conflict is present and coherent but not sharply escalated or deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Lila’s fear of emptiness and failed meaning—is present and the conversation clearly addresses it, but pressure remains low and mostly abstract. Elias’s interventions don’t really corner her into a difficult trade-off; she opens up and accepts his reframing with little resistance. The walk and talk deepen her state but don’t significantly escalate risk or cost. The resulting “dance” feels like a gentle adjustment rather than a choice that closes off a live, painful option.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared (preserving the echo of wisdom) but never viscerally tested; the consecration proceeds with almost no resistance or complication. Pressure does increase somewhat through the pavilion’s urging and kinetic surge, but there is no genuine reversal or narrowing of options. Mara and the prophet never have to trade off or sacrifice, so the cost of failure remains abstract. The piece reads more as a successful ceremony than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake is Lila’s need to transmute grief into art versus accepting that the “masterpiece” may already exist in the factory-field collaboration. However, this tension never tightens into more than a gentle unease; there’s no concrete test or risk if she fails, and no serious counter-desire. The realization that the masterpiece is already there is more of a soft repricing than a pressured decision. Escalation is minimal, so the conflict feels understated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s internal shift from private observer to someone willing to share a difficult, non-linear understanding of growth. Pressure escalates modestly: the crystal’s fall, his intensifying pattern recognition, and the resulting urgency to record and later "testify." However, external or oppositional forces (colleagues’ likely dismissal) remain hypothetical and off-page, so no option is sharply foreclosed. The result is a convincing but low-tension progression rather than a strongly pressurized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound to prove he isn’t just “a ghost haunting the edges of tomorrow”—is clearly signaled and pursued throughout. Pressure escalates accumulatively via physical wear (“hands were raw,” “knees aching”) and the repeated failures to hold on to visions, with a meaningful tightening when the faint hum appears and he must follow it through the maze. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with relatively low on-page risk beyond emotional validation, so the sense of cost at the peak is present but not intense. The resolution is earned and coherent but not sharply agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    There is clear external pressure (increasing tremors, structural cracks, intensifying spin/whine) and a corresponding escalation in his interventions. The dominant stake—whether Elias can control or repurpose this rupture in time/space—is legible but not grounded in a concrete downside beyond collapse. His choice to leap is a bold act but not framed against a vivid alternative or sacrificed relationship, so cost is mostly conceptual. Conflict between staying to master the phenomenon and ordinary survival instinct could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—facilitating a meaningful final goodbye—is clear from early on and does intensify as Elias begins to sing and approaches death. Pressure builds through the uncertainty of whether he will respond to the hymn and whether Clara will get a true last moment with him. Still, Mira encounters little real resistance or ethical friction; her method works smoothly, and there’s no serious chance of failure or trade-off that would significantly narrow options. The result is emotionally affecting but not truly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant conflict is essentially intellectual: can Lirael decode the key and the sealed awakenings in time for a rare celestial configuration. There is one clear tightening—the approaching alignment when the isle’s shadow points due north—but little sense of what she risks losing if she fails, beyond missed knowledge. The activation of the dais is a deliberate action that resolves the puzzle, yet no new complication or price arises from success. As a result, tension is present but mild; it never quite feels like a hard tradeoff or a dangerous leap.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to reconcile her rationalism, the garden’s magic, and her history with Elias—is clear and tracks through the scene. There is a real tightening when Elias undercuts her assumption about the tooth’s purpose and frames it as a sacrifice “to us.” However, the conflict remains fairly low-friction: they don’t strongly resist or clash, and her decision to proceed with both teeth comes without a hard trade-off or genuine risk of loss. Tension operates more as quiet pressure than escalation, which softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elara find a way to share light without consuming it—is clear, but pressure escalates gently rather than sharply. Polishing, weighing, and releasing the pearl are all executed without real resistance or risk; there’s no moment where her desire to keep the pearl for herself or fear of failure seriously threatens her goal. The weighing scene hints at a moral or metaphysical trade-off (light vs. darkness in equilibrium) but doesn’t force a hard choice beyond symbolic confirmation. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping, keeping conflict effective but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Lila will stay locked in static memorialization or risk reconfiguring her grief and letting someone in—is clear and does progress. Pressure escalates primarily through intimacy rather than plot: from showing Elias the pattern, to opening the pendant, to allowing him to alter it and then asking him to stay. That escalation is emotionally credible but gentle; external consequences (viral scrutiny, family fallout, or fear of judgment) stay offstage, so the conflict never quite bites as hard as it could. The cost is present but somewhat cushioned by how readily Elias agrees and how little real resistance appears in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will cling to tidy endings or embrace open, living ones—is clear but lightly pressured. The main tightening is the encounter with her double declaring “Your stories end too soon” and identifying the shell as a key, which nudges Clara toward change rather than forcing a hard trade-off. Her final decision to rewrite is meaningful but nearly frictionless; fear, loss, or risk are implied more than dramatized. The conflict never quite bites hard enough to feel truly high-stakes even within the small-scale frame.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—reviving the arbor’s fading magic—is clearly established and addressed head-on in the ritual scene. There is some escalation as the music intensifies, the tendril spins, and the magic visibly spreads, with Lira pushing past physical strain. However, there are no real obstacles, setbacks, or hard trade-offs; once she begins, everything unfolds smoothly toward success. This keeps tension relatively soft and the sense of risk modest despite the nominally high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias can successfully seal the fickle safekept starlight this time—is clear, and the mention of three prior failures gives the ritual some implicit risk. However, on the page, opposition is minimal: there’s no serious on-scene threat of failure, interruption, or loss beyond the abstract memory of past attempts. The humming plate and subsequent success arrive without a real tightening where an option closes or a price is visibly paid. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than genuinely escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the timer/harvest during the wounded season—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and low-risk on the page. Pressure escalates modestly from puzzling over the mechanism to the moment of activation, but Elias succeeds on his first dramatized attempt, with no material setback or real possibility of failure dramatized in-scene. Internal pressure (his doubt about “cellar of reason”) does not sharpen into a dilemma that would force a sacrifice. As a result, the story is absorbing but feels more like an elegant demonstration than a trial with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating burdens without shattering them, and whether he’ll confront his mother’s—is clear and coherent throughout. Escalation is modest but present: the draft extinguishing the flame and the resistant obsidian both force Kael to adapt and recommit. The culminating choice to leave the locket untouched carries emotional cost, but the story skirts explicit on-page pressure (no live opposition, deadline, or palpable risk beyond procedure) that might have intensified this beat. As a result, tension remains atmospheric rather than gripping, effective but not fully wrung out.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara can re-engage with life and grief by carving the lion—is clear from early on and resolved by the final image. Pressure accumulates gently as she moves from hesitation to active carving to reflective placement of the lion, with the husband’s last gift and note providing a subtle but real push. However, the conflict never quite tightens into a sharper trade-off or real risk; there’s little sense that she might walk away mid-process or that carving could make things worse. The result is emotionally satisfying but low-tension, more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Veyra can stop clinging to fragments and forgive herself—is clear from early on and tightens effectively in the confrontation when the ghost demands “courage to let go.” Her decision to drop the camera wheel is a genuine narrowing of options: it forecloses the fantasy of solving the lagoon/ghost through objects or stories and risks losing the one “key” she’s identified. Internal and external pressures (the haunting, the time-stalled lagoon, her mother’s death site) interweave, though the consequences of her final wading departure are left more mythic than concretely costly, which keeps the escalation just short of searing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—can Lila repurpose a dead system into a new, hopeful function—is clear, but pressure is modest. Once she finds the sextant, the process of redirecting flows proceeds without resistance, failure, or a meaningful trade-off; the hum escalates atmosphere more than stakes. There is a mild tightening (the terminal awakens and the equation appears), but no option is truly foreclosed, and the cost is almost entirely conceptual. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will stay trapped in a self-eroding silence or renegotiate her relationship with the keep—is established and followed through. The bear’s appearance provides a clear escalation of external pressure that forces her to confront her fear and curiosity. However, the encounter resolves with almost no real danger or cost; the bear is benign very quickly, which softens tension. The internal conflict progresses, but the lack of sharper consequence at the peak keeps escalation from feeling fully earned at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will use the sundial to penetrate the “architecture of lies”—is signaled early, and there is a clear tightening when the shadow points to the warehouse and later to the blueprint. Opposition and cost are minimal: the captain’s warning never bites, and Elias encounters no real resistance entering the warehouse or decoding the clue. The escalation is primarily informational, not pressured; his agency is to keep following the trail, with no moment where he must sacrifice something tangible. As a result, tension feels low even as understanding deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will truly access/understand the weavers’ legacy—is clear but mostly conceptual. Pressure accumulates as he decodes successive knots and then faces the woman’s correction that “the loom isn’t here,” which is a useful tightening of his expectations. However, there’s little sense of risk or trade-off beyond reorienting his understanding; no option is visibly foreclosed besides a more literal, artifact-focused quest. The story works as a quiet intensification, but the lack of a sharper price or dilemma keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand and “map” absence—is clear but rarely feels under genuine threat. The main turn (the woman’s apparition and shared moment) arrives without real difficulty or a tested trade-off; Elara doesn’t have to risk or relinquish much to achieve her aim. There’s minimal escalation of pressure: once she kneels by the thread, events unfold almost compliantly. As a result, the ending is affecting but not hard-earned in conflict terms.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Corvin reawaken organic beauty in a mechanized world—is clear, and the tightening around the hatching night provides a credible escalation. The keening, glowing veins, and cracking shell create a strong local pressure spike. Still, opposition remains mostly historical and offstage; no present-tense force (internal terror of failure, mechanical failure, or external threat) sharply constrains his options in the climax. The result is that victory feels almost purely providential once the process starts, with limited sense of trade-off or risk beyond implied fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant on-page conflict—whether and how Lira helps Mara and the bird—is clear but low-stakes, with only modest escalation as she warns “it’ll hurt” and tests the girl’s bravery. Internal stakes (her attempt to live differently from her father) are interesting but mostly declared rather than pressured into a hard trade-off. The beat where Mara must release the bird is a genuine tightening, and Lira’s insistence carries a small emotional cost. Still, nothing truly corners Lira or forces a painful renunciation, so pressure plateaus rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped memories—is clear from early on, and tension does build as she accumulates items and stalls on the missing eighth. Internal conflict (skepticism vs imaginative faith) is present but gentle; she rarely seems at real risk of quitting or failing, and external opposition is mostly environmental rather than antagonistic. The main tightening is her return to the central fountain and demand to herself, which effectively narrows the path forward. Still, the solution via vision and drain-prying arrives with relative ease, so the felt cost and escalation plateau rather than spike.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciling fire’s legacy with a desire for healing light—is clear, and the sonar’s shift to “urgency” gives a modest escalation. The encounter with the great-grandmother is the main tightening; it forces Lumin to confront the moral history of fire rather than pursue a purely technical solution. However, external pressure is light and there’s no real on-page test of Lumin’s resolve against resistance; the choice is framed as revelation more than hard trade-off. The stakes remain mostly philosophical rather than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marlow will remain sealed in inherited, unspoken grief or step into voiced, shared grief—is clear but plays out gently. Pressure increases somewhat through the ongoing mentorship and the approaching culmination of the migration, yet there’s little real contestation or reversal; once the voice appears, he mostly complies. The main tightening is the “final night” deadline where he chooses to read his own poem, which does crystallize his stance. Overall, conflict is more contemplative than fraught, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing chaos by restarting the pendulum during the Hush—is clearly signaled and maintained. Pressure does escalate conceptually as the pause lengthens and the ridge’s danger is evoked, and the choice to use the rake inscription rather than brute mechanical force is a meaningful, thematically consistent tactic shift. Still, the conflict is comparatively frictionless: no serious failure, competing obligation, or close-call consequence complicates her path. The story feels tense in idea more than in on-page jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the intentions encoded in the tapestry—is clear, but the story offers almost no resistance or counter-pressure to Elara’s goal. Decoding proceeds smoothly; there are no real costs, threats, or difficult trade-offs beyond the abstract weight of knowledge. The one tightening beat is the realization that the tapestry records intentions across time, but this doesn’t significantly narrow her options. As a result, tension feels intellectual rather than lived, and escalation remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Lira’s model and imagination break the tyranny of winter—is clear, and the equinox gathering is an effective test. Yet the opposition stays soft: Elders and villagers scoff, but there’s little concrete risk or irreversible consequence if she’s wrong beyond reputation. Escalation is more conceptual than pressurized; once the prediction is made, events move almost frictionlessly toward the thaw. The story would benefit from at least one harder on-page challenge that narrows her options or exacts a visible price before success.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering fragments of lost stories to stave off cultural silence—is compelling conceptually but receives only gentle on-page pressure. The closest thing to escalation is the signal fading, her scramble to catch the key verse, and the moss’s glow intensifying, which provides tonal deepening rather than a true narrowing of options or hard trade-off. There’s no serious threat of failure, nor a moment where she must choose between competing goods or costs. As a result, tension is present but mild, keeping the conflict band solid but not especially strong.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether Lira will risk herself to “crystallize a fleeting emotion” in a place that erases art—is clear, but the pressure does not meaningfully escalate beyond Elias’s warning and Lira’s own reflective awareness. The most concrete tightening is when she removes the mask and touches the portrait, then decides to leave it unfinished and put the mask back on, effectively choosing a controlled incompletion over total exposure. That choice carries some cost (continued self-erasure, continued haunting desire), yet the story treats it more as a gentle cadence than a hard trade-off; no option is dramatically foreclosed on the page. As a result, tension feels steady and textural rather than sharply rising.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s commitment to his archaic, meaning-rich worldview vs. Mara’s demand for survivalist pragmatism—is clear, and Mara’s presence actively pressures him. There is one meaningful tightening when she calls the cog “scrap metal” and demands proof, pushing him into the deeper dig and the improvised astrolabe. However, escalation remains mostly intellectual and textural; beyond bleeding hands and fatigue, there’s limited sense that his choice forecloses a substantial alternative path on the page. The tension is steady but never quite sharpens into a truly precarious decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether endangered arts and cultural memory can be kept alive amid rising hatred—is clearly signaled but mostly operates at an abstract, societal level. On the page, the primary tension is whether Elias will play and whether their collaboration can cohere into something meaningful; that beat works but resolves quickly without a major trade-off. The later escalation (“Clara invited others… The library became a sanctuary”) is summarized rather than tested in-scene, so we don’t see options narrowing or a price visibly paid. As a result, pressure feels gently rising rather than acute, effective but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the plant will embody traumatic history or a gentler, future-bearing pattern—is clear, and the pruning sequence provides a natural avenue for escalating pressure via increasingly charged memories. However, the plant’s “resistance” remains mostly abstract, and there are no meaningful reversals or hard trade-offs; each new cut leads to more desirable memories with little on-page risk to Elara or the plant beyond momentary overwhelm. The celestial alignment is framed as a now-or-never window, but its ticking-clock pressure never forces a compromised choice. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the resolution feels somewhat foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring both power and communal wonder—is clear, and the discovery of the failed drones plus the riddle meaningfully tightens pressure. However, antagonistic force is mostly conceptual (disbelief/complacency) and never really pushes back on Clara once she decides to act. Her choice to speak out is important but comparatively low-cost, and the quick citywide response softens the sense of hard-earned reversal. Tension is present but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s need to test her theory and understand “alive” houses—is present but mostly intellectual, with little suggestion of risk if she fails. Escalation is limited to the atmosphere thickening and the objects glowing; there’s no serious doubt or alternative path considered. Her agency matters in that she decides to gather and arrange the objects, but no option is truly foreclosed or morally charged. The result is a gentle deepening rather than felt pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are substantial (oceanic blight and familial truth), and they’re legible from early on. There is one clear tightening when the sealed pedestal blocks direct access and forces Mara to exploit the structural weakness. However, the conflict resolves with relatively little resistance or cost—Mara finds the crack quickly, opens the pedestal without real setback, and drinks the unknown serum without sustained hesitation or moral friction. The piece would benefit from at least one harder test of will or risk that doesn’t feel so frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of his loss through perpetual motion—is clear early and tightened when he attempts a risky rupture. Pressure escalates from contemplation and proofs to a concrete, irreversible act that could destabilize the staircase, then to the quieter, more costly choice to leave the orbiting dice untouched. Internal and external conflicts align well, though they remain largely conceptual and never quite threaten him in a visceral or irrevocably damaging way beyond the emotional realm. The resolution feels earned but not harrowingly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—Lila’s need for tangible proof that kindness endures—is clear, but the pressure escalates gently rather than sharply. The main tightening is the moment she links moonlight to rousing dormant memories and paints Elena’s sorrowful eyes, which then provoke Mr. Voss’s revelation. Her final decision to learn the language is an earned resolution of the internal conflict, but the sense of cost or foreclosed alternatives is muted (her insomnia and restlessness do not quite bite back). The piece functions more as a lyric deepening than as a strongly pressurized conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The core stake—whether Lila will let the arts freeze into mere history or risk reviving them—is signaled and followed through, but escalation is mild. Once she decides to host a festival and teach the children, nothing credible pushes back or threatens failure; there’s no real trade-off on the page beyond implied energy and vulnerability. The beekeeper’s absence and vanished bees color the backdrop but never become active antagonistic pressures. As a result, the piece has tension as a mood more than as escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the stone to “step beyond fate”—is clear early and escalates via the failed first attempt and the more dangerous second, which awakens the lighthouse and the island itself. Conflict is primarily puzzle/engineering pressure rather than interpersonal or moral, which limits the sense of true sacrifice or competing goods. The stone’s “hunger” and the island’s shudder hint at larger, possibly catastrophic stakes, but those stakes remain abstractly ominous rather than concretely tested. Elias’s agency is strong, yet the price of his success is not fully articulated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—confronting an embodied fear/truth in the funhouse—is clear, and pressure escalates from eerie atmosphere to physical confrontation (shadow, moths, searing thread). Mara’s agency drives the key turns: choosing to enter, to stand still, to utter the paradoxical lie, and to seize the thread. However, the tangible price she pays for victory feels modest, and the external conflict resolves relatively straightforwardly once the dictionary’s method is applied. The internal stakes (her relationship to fear and truth) are gestured at but not fully tested against a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—turning prior chaos into ordered harmony and stabilizing the orchard—is legible and her agency clearly drives the escalation of sound. There is some intensification (flat note to resonance, apples starting to fall, driftwood groaning, her arms aching), but opposition remains largely abstract and never forces a hard trade-off. The ritual feels demanding yet not truly perilous, which keeps tension more aesthetic than urgent. As a result, the final “victory” reads satisfying but not hard-fought.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s pursuit of forbidden knowledge in a precarious, trapped city—escalates well from curiosity to existential threat as the shells literally wake. Her agency drives the inciting and mid-story turns (investigating the crack, entering the tunnels), though the final catastrophe feels more like an unleashed force than a choice with an on-page reckoning. Tension scales from localized mystery to city-wide peril effectively, but the moral and personal cost of her pursuit isn’t quite forced into a sharp trade-off in the climax. Pressure is strong and coherent, just shy of fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual and reputational: uncovering and correctly framing a dangerous historical truth. We get a meaningful deepening when Elara realizes the “noble lie” was a collaborative compromise for survival rather than simple propaganda, which shifts her goal from debunking to recontextualizing. However, the on-page pressure remains low—no one contests her discovery, there’s no immediate danger, and the “after the final petal drops” condition never forces a trade-off or urgent choice. The conflict plays more as an elegant speculative puzzle than a truly tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elara’s desire to verify and connect with the “abandoned dreams” she studies—complemented by mild situational unease when the pavilion groans and she’s alone. There is one clear tightening when she chooses to open the hatch and confront the unknown source of the sound. However, after that turn, conflict resolves without real resistance: the chamber yields information, there’s no ethical or emotional dilemma beyond wonder, and no significant price for pursuing her curiosity. The result is a gentle escalation that suits the tone but doesn’t reach high-stakes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will uncover and accept the city’s suppressed origins—remains coherent, and pressure does tighten as she moves from ritual cataloging to decoding a vault to confronting the journal’s claims. The main turn is her choice to engage with the strange door and then to claim the journal and stamp, reorienting her from archivist to active witness. However, external danger and immediate risk remain low; the tension is primarily intellectual and thematic, with only brief gestural nods toward physical peril (groans, slick stairs). The result is a satisfying but relatively gentle escalation rather than a sharply narrowing field of options.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform her grief and relationship to the shadow—is signaled early and tightened by the decision to record her brother’s last words. Escalation comes through the recording sequence: the basilica shudders, light storms the sky, cranes animate, and then the shadow itself returns, forcing a clear stance. Her agency is central: she chooses to hold up the lantern and name her lack of fear rather than repeat past avoidance. The emotional price of reopening grief is present but could be made slightly more viscerally costly in the moment of confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s willingness to risk herself and reality to access unused potential—is signaled early and escalates logically from scanning to physically entering an unstable node. Refusing Orion’s abort commands and stepping into the vortex are clear tightening beats that narrow options and heighten danger. The cost is partly external (loss of observatory, shattering geode) and partly existential (embracing a dangerous new role), though the danger to “reality” itself stays more gestured at than felt. Stakes could be sharpened by giving the node’s instability a more specific, on-page repercussion beyond a spectacular reset.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—recover the chip / unlock the “frequency of belonging”—is clear, and the main tightening is Lira’s decision to trust the pilgrim and pull the ancient lever. However, conflict is quite low-friction: the pilgrim is helpful, the mechanism works on the first try, and there’s no real risk or opposing force beyond mild hesitation. Internal stakes (what belonging means to Lira personally) are only lightly sketched, so the final resonance has more conceptual than felt tension. As a result, escalation feels smooth and intriguing rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will collude in Lila’s desired erasure or confront her with truth—is clear and coheres throughout. Pressure meaningfully tightens as the driftwood visions shift from generalized guilt to a specific father/son wound that parallels Lila’s situation. The escalation is primarily internal and conceptual rather than actively contested by another agent, so the decision is weighty but not fiercely tested. The final renunciation of his usual service is earned but could stand one sharper on-page moment of risk or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—lives at risk in a prisoner exchange and Clara’s fear of repeating past mistakes—are articulated early and clearly. There is a meaningful, if quiet, internal turn in Clara’s decision to release the talisman and reframe which mistakes to carry. However, external conflict is conspicuously underplayed: the exchange contains no obstacle, complication, or ethical crunch on the page, so tension plateaus rather than escalates. The result is thematically charged but dramatically soft, with limited sense of options narrowing or real-time prices being paid.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will continue hiding in regret and inherited stories or risk acting on her own values—is signaled early and resolved clearly. Pressure accumulates through solitude, the disorienting behavior of the compass and poles, and the memory of the fight, culminating in the choice to leave the compass and head back toward town. Escalation is more contemplative than dramatic; no sharp reversal forces her hand, and external stakes remain low. The cost of her choice is present but somewhat under-dramatized, keeping the conflict solid rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will confront and reconfigure her erased, dirty past—is legible and tracks from the first paragraph to the end. Escalation exists in her movement from abstract suspicion to immersive confrontation with alternate lives at the lake, then to a new interpretive stance. However, opposition is soft: nothing seriously resists her goals beyond her own hesitation, and even that is only lightly dramatized. As a result, the felt cost and narrowing of options at the climax plateau at a thoughtful rather than gripping level.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will sacrifice her human identity to preserve the bond—is clear early and escalates steadily through the initiation of the ritual and the onset of physical metamorphosis. The story tightens pressure well: refusal risks the bond’s dissolution, compliance risks self-erasure, and her eventual choice closes one path with a felt cost. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, though the pain or fallout of the choice is resolved somewhat gently (“not to lose it, but to honor it”), reducing the sense of real sacrifice at the peak. A sharper sense of ongoing or irreversible loss would push the stakes higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconfigure her relationship to her mother’s absence and to “repentance”—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation is present but subtle: the ritual deepens from laying out cards to physically opening the crack, climbing the tree, then confronting the vision. Her agency matters (she chooses to trace her palm, to “unfasten” the crack, to place *The World* card), but the cost of these choices is relatively soft, with little visible trade-off beyond emotional exposure. The piece leans on lyric intensification rather than sharp reversals, which works but keeps pressure in a mid-high band rather than truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal and external stakes are clearly articulated—the ship’s possible failure and the ethical risk of “becoming the monster” by engaging. Pressure escalates from AI prompting to the meditation chamber to the confrontation with shadows and the door. However, once Lira says “I am ready,” resistance drops quickly; the shadows dissolve without much contest, and there’s little sense of options narrowing or of a near-loss, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake is Lira’s need to understand transformation and her own role in shaping change, which is signaled early and addressed by the stranger’s challenge. Pressure intensifies when he reframes her life’s work as prophecy-fulfillment and presents the final jar, forcing a micro-choice to open it and accept the consequences. However, resistance is minimal and the external situation is never truly fraught; the piece largely avoids real loss or a sharp trade-off beyond the internal shift. As a result, escalation feels gentle and contemplative rather than gripping, effective but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—using this blackout to ignite a hidden revolution—is declared early and paid off by accessing the cradle. However, on-page resistance is minimal: the puzzle yields quickly, and no one actively opposes them or forces a trade-off beyond the ambient risk of being caught. Because no real option is foreclosed and no sacrifice is required, escalation feels more like smooth progression than tightening pressure. Tension exists conceptually but never quite bites in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira restores/understands the sacred patterns or triggers destruction—is clear, and pressure escalates via increasingly intense configurations (Fibonacci, Pascal’s triangle, Möbius strip) and visions of harmony versus void. Her agency drives each turn as she chooses new sequences and adds symbols, which is strong. However, the opposition remains largely abstract (visions and surging light) so the sense of irreversible cost or narrowed options never fully bites; she seems to have unlimited chances to “reorder” without losing anything concrete. The final resolution feels a touch easy because no specific sacrifice or closed path is foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will continue to self-censor or risk uncensored expression—is legible early via his flight from the Ministry and the envelope’s promise. Pressure escalates through the storm’s intensification and the discovery/reading of the cartographer’s poem, which reweights his options. The decisive turn is his choice to write, seal, and plan to mail his own raw poem, effectively foreclosing the safer path of quiet obscurity. Conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative; the off-page danger means the escalation is strong but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—philosophical approach to questions, embodied in a duel—is clearly established, and there is one meaningful deepening when the card’s constellation interrupts the fight and reframes the goal. The external duel escalates modestly (a graze, a disarm), and the main turn is the mutual realization that translation/collaboration matters more than winning. However, the pressure never feels genuinely tight; there is little sense that defeat, injury, or ideological rupture carries real cost, so the duel risks feeling symbolic rather than dangerous. The result is elegant but somewhat low-pressure for the lofty framework.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict is internal—Cedar’s fear of monthly psychic disintegration versus his desire to remain a coherent poet—and it does escalate when he molts mid-story and discovers the unfamiliar poem. Externally, Marla and the prison context offer soft, background pressure rather than active antagonism, so stakes remain quiet. The key tightening is his on-page molt: instead of panicking, he chooses to consult the tin and then accept a riskier stance toward his own anarchy. This is emotionally effective though relatively low on visceral or situational tension for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—Clara seeking a refuge from paralyzing fate/choice—is clear, and pressure escalates from surface restlessness to a more active, subterranean defiance. The main tightening comes when she sees the hidden room in the film and chooses to physically descend, culminating in the extended performance that pointedly ignores the compasses. However, conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric; there is little sense of risk or loss beyond mood, which keeps the stakes from biting as hard as they might. The final refusal to heed “fate” is satisfying but not steeply priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—saving the island’s collective memory before the monsoon—appears early and remains coherent throughout. There is escalation from subtle dissonance to explicit visions of obliteration in the dream pool, and Lira’s demand to “Show me the fracture” is a solid agency beat. However, opposition is largely conceptual and compliant: once the test of doubt is identified, the path to resolution is smooth, and no real alternative path is forced to close. The story would benefit from one concrete complication or cost that tests her resolve more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Lira can confront and reconfigure her father’s disappearance—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening from workshop theory to dangerous sea to ghost confrontation. Yet the conflict remains relatively frictionless: the lace works on first attempt, the ghost appears readily, and both sides apologize without resistance or complication. Emotional cost is present but soft; there’s no meaningful risk of failure or hard trade-off beyond speaking painful truths once. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than sharply escalating.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    External conflict is dismissed in summary ("She ignored them"), and the climax—a symposium presentation—lacks visceral risk or failure states. The stakes remain abstract and intellectual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    External pressure is negligible; the antagonist is absent, and the physical obstacles are trivial. The stakes remain purely internal and theoretical, resolved by reading a message rather than forcing the protagonist to make a sacrifice or trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist succeeds at every step without setbacks, opposition, or failure. The ending provides global acclaim and total resolution rather than a difficult, earned personal shift with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist is asked to perform a task and succeeds without significant failure, cost, or opposition. The repair process is glossed over, robbing the climax of earned stakes or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of survival are declared, the on-page conflict lacks teeth; the council’s opposition dissolves almost immediately upon Mira’s challenge. The resolution feels inevitable because the protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure or sacrifice in executing her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict. Lira faces no external antagonism, no internal doubt, and no physical scarcity; the "bitter" taste of the tear is a trivial inconvenience. The narrative lacks a dominant stake because failure is never a possibility; the story is a procession toward an inevitable, cost-free success.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the disintegration sequence raises the stakes, the immediate restoration of the bridge deflates the tension completely. The resolution creates a "no-fault" outcome where the status quo is improved by magic rather than a hard trade-off or sacrifice from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.4)
    Tension evaporates at the climax because the obstacles (chains, scavengers) are removed by sudden superhuman strength and magic rather than character agency or trade-offs. The antagonist force is a paper tiger that is defeated instantly, resulting in a lack of genuine escalation or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates cleanly when the initial mixture fails, forcing Lira to sacrifice the "centerpiece" tree rooted in her father's history. This cost is felt on the page. The stakes are deeply personal, though the antagonist is abstract (grief/silence), limiting the external tension slightly compared to the internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is flat due to a lack of active opposition; the guard sleeps through the heist, and the "test" of the jar is resolved instantly without struggle. The stakes are nominally high (destiny, memory), but the absence of a credible threat or a painful trade-off makes the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low; the primary obstacle is a rusted screw, and the stakes remain abstract ("curiosity"). The resolution lacks a felt price; the protagonist succeeds without enduring a significant loss or making a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict is resolved through a weak physical action (throwing a script) and a summary news article, evading the cost of the confrontation. The "outwitting" lacks tactical depth, relying on the antagonist's unexplained reaction to the recited notes rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.3)
    External pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; potential obstacles like the groaning walls or resisting paper are ignored rather than confronted, requiring no tactical adaptation. The stakes ("edge of oblivion") remain abstract and theoretical, lacking an immediate, felt cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; the robot's &quot;remarkable composition&quot; removes tension from the climax. There is no felt cost to the transformation, as the protagonist gains enlightenment without risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are negligible as Elias faces no external opposition or internal dilemma; Lira explains the mystery immediately, and he accepts the paradigm shift without hesitation. The conflict is purely theoretical, and the lack of obstacles or risks turns the narrative into a passive guided tour.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain low throughout; Elara’s methods are never truly threatened, and her victory over the algorithm is effortless. Joren offers no meaningful opposition, capitulating after a single demonstration, which prevents the conflict from escalating or forcing a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is purely mechanical—a brief system destabilization resolved by rapid button-pushing. Stakes remain theoretical ("proving" a concept) and the resolution requires no difficult trade-off, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric and external rather than driven by a difficult choice between competing values. The potential cost of the climax—losing the code—is immediately negated by Clara's convenient perfect memory, flattening the stakes of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high (survival vs. collapse), and the tightening from suspicion to confirmation is legible. However, the conflict is largely internal; the external pressure from the crew or director is ambient rather than active, making the escape feel unopposed and lowering the immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely external and resolved through exposition; the declared danger (the machine is "hungry") never manifests as an immediate physical threat forcing a difficult trade-off. The climax involves watching a projection rather than making a high-stakes choice, lowering the felt pressure of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the library's resistance is vague ("groaning steps") and never threatens the protagonist's success or forces a trade-off. The climax lacks agency and stakes, as the protagonist simply sits in the water and is passively "regenerated," resolving the central tension through magical intervention rather than an earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the conflict is a polite philosophical difference with no risk of rupture or loss. The escalation relies on external phenomena (the eclipse, the magic glow) rather than protagonist agency or rising interpersonal tension, resulting in a climax with zero felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is minimal and lacks escalation; the stakes are abstract ("world grew quieter") and the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma. The resolution involves no trade-off or sacrifice; Elias simply realizes the truth and acts without risk, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain largely abstract ("slow-burn revolution") until the sudden inclusion of the dockworker, whose plight is unearned by prior scene work. The external pressure is low, with the storm serving as background decor rather than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretical; the "possession" is a stated timer that generates no on-page dread or tactical friction. The conflict is resolved too easily by the protagonist shouting metaphors, lacking a "felt cost" or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is the primary weakness; the threat of exhaustion is stated ("loomed like a thief") but never manifests as an obstacle that forces a tradeoff or meaningful escalation. The protagonist achieves her goal through the aid of the shell without facing genuine opposition or paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("finding a version of herself") and lack an antagonist or time pressure beyond a mild "tug." The climax is observational; the protagonist watches alternate lives rather than making high-stakes trade-offs in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or cost; the protagonist identifies a problem, receives an immediate solution, and is cured without failure or trade-off. The lack of an antagonist or obstacle—internal or external—flattens the narrative arc completely.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; Elias faces no physical resistance, pursuit, or difficult trade-offs during his mission. The confrontation with the contact is transactional and devoid of tension—she simply hands him the vial and he leaves. The lack of an active antagonist allows the protagonist to coast to victory without paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain low as the "risk" of unraveling mentioned in exposition never materializes in the scene. The protagonist faces no true dilemma or opposition; the choice to open the vial leads linearly to a positive epiphany without complication, sacrifice, or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    The decision to unravel the rope forces a confrontation with specific memories ("failed poem, lost friend"), creating a legible emotional cost. The internal conflict is successfully externalized through the interaction with the prop.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("chronic hush," "wall of silence") but never tested; the opposition evaporates the moment Lira begins to play. There is no escalation of pressure; the environment and crowd yield immediately, resulting in a low-stakes victory lap rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the client's desire aligns perfectly with the dealer's supply. The "cost" of the half-truth is theoretical—mentioned in dialogue—but Lira accepts it instantly, removing any potential for escalation or tension. The stakes remain abstract because the transaction encounters no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low; the protagonist's primary conflict is a vague restlessness resolved by a low-risk, unopposed action. The forgery of the conductor's letter is presented as a purely positive act without the ethical friction or potential cost that would generate genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.4)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist identifies a goal and achieves it with smooth, uncomplicated agency, facing no genuine opposition or risk of failure. The dominant stake of loneliness is resolved through a meeting that feels inevitable rather than earned, with no visible trade-offs or sacrifices made along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is linear and low-stakes; the environment and magic yield to the protagonist without significant obstruction. The pivotal moment is resolved by a simple interaction with the pendant ("twisted"), and the choice is made "without thinking," which dampens the sense of earned escalation or personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are purely internal; while the desire to understand is evident, the lack of external pressure or time constraints keeps tension low. The resolution comes through insight rather than a choice between competing values or a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no opposition; the only obstacle (a grille) is removed easily with a screwdriver, and the "flickering lights" provide ambient rather than causal pressure. The stakes are declared ("change everything") but never tested, resulting in a linear progression with no meaningful tightening or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are purely internal and theoretical ("stifling her work") without a dramatized failure or antagonist to force a difficult choice. Eleanor surrenders control immediately upon seeing the plant's behavior, skipping the necessary escalation of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or trade-offs, merely following a path to a benevolent encounter. The resolution comes via coincidence and a gift, lacking the tension or cost required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear (the sanctity of the cave vs. new power), and the cost of the final choice is visceral. However, the escalation is linear; the protagonist offers little resistance to the antagonist's temptation, softening the conflict's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The "obstacles" are passively overcome by waiting, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no meaningful tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is negligible; Elias faces no external opposition and his internal struggle is stated rather than tested. The stakes are abstract (&quot;validating journeys&quot;), and the resolution comes without a visible cost or a moment where failure seems possible.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, dilemma, or risk. The transition from restlessness to connection is smooth and frictionless, devoid of the stakes required to drive narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—stagnation versus the terrifying unknown—is clear and resolves with a tangible cost. The pressure escalates coherently through the storm and Lira’s arrival. The resolution feels earned within the scene's logic, though the antagonist (boredom/inertia) is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.2)
    The antagonists fold immediately upon the reveal of the dummy, offering no resistance or counter-move, which deflates all tension. The stakes are high in theory (political asylum) but low in practice because the victory is granted without a visible price or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=2.2)
    Stakes are abstract ("unlocking the secrets of time") and face no concrete opposition or test. The climax—writing furiously as a hum gets louder—involves no trade-off, risk, or loss, resulting in a flat narrative with zero tension.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (identity/memory) is static because the protagonist holds the key knowledge from the start. Pressure comes from an arbitrary storm rather than an antagonist or escalating choices, functioning as a *deus ex machina* to reveal the clue. There is no active opposition on the page, leaving the conflict internal and repetitive until the sudden external shift.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the environment yields to the protagonist’s first attempt without opposition. There is no risk of failure or meaningful price paid for the success, making the climax feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes are declared but the opposition is a straw man; the Council retreats immediately upon seeing the mural, lacking causal credibility. There is no escalation of pressure in the final scene, only a presentation that yields an easy victory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ticking clock of the dawn and approaching drones provides functional pressure, but the stakes remain low and symbolic. The resolution—a smile as the gas fades—lacks a significant cost or sacrifice, making the conflict feel gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are bureaucratic and low; the potential failure of the drone carries no dramatized threat beyond a job improperly done. The conflict is purely technical and lacks interpersonal or internal pressure, resolving smoothly once the mentor intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared ("You'll die out there") but never felt; Clara faces no genuine opposition from the environment or Jorn. The resolution comes too easily via the phrasebook's guidance, lacking a sense of earned cost or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story lacks genuine opposition or the risk of failure; the progression from decay to revival is linear and inevitable, missing a moment of tightening where the protagonist must pay a price or alter tactics to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    External pressure from the storm and the crumbling temple provides a functional ticking clock. However, the internal conflict resolves somewhat easily via the magical object, lacking a moment of agonizing trade-off or deeper personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are theoretical; the threat of "drowning" is negated by the protagonist's unexplained ability to hover and the lattice's convenient magic. The conflict is resolved through a verbal retort to a mirror image, lacking any felt sacrifice or trade-off. The external pressure (the waiting bodies) is explicitly dismissed ("no longer cared") rather than confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no on-page escalation or resistance; the protagonist's single attempt works immediately with no complication or trade-off. The "debt" is paid through a magic mechanism, lacking a visible or felt cost in the dramatic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is largely static; the labyrinth yields to the protagonist's tools without active opposition or adaptation. The cost of success ("fingers raw") is nominal and asserted rather than dramatized as a trade-off. The climax resolves via a pre-ordained instruction (the plate) rather than a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure evaporates the moment it appears; the roots threaten Lirael but immediately recede when the sundial is placed, removing the physical stakes. The decision to summarize the rebuilding process ("rebuilt the shrine piece by piece") removes the opportunity for escalation or genuine setbacks. The protagonist succeeds without facing a moment where failure seems plausible or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time pressure, or significant risk of failure. The "scavengers" and "storms" are mentioned but never manifest, and the vendor is a trivial annoyance. The stakes remain abstract ("resistance") and the protagonist's path to the goal is unobstructed, resulting in a lack of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pressure is low; the "coup" is a distant abstraction that creates no immediate danger or friction within the scene. Zara’s actions are safe and pre-planned, resulting in a lecture-like demonstration rather than an escalation of stakes or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; the spirits are welcoming and the ritual succeeds immediately upon request. There is no opposition or escalation of stakes, making the outcome feel inevitable and the "courage" unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the declared stakes (war/peace) are high, the on-page conflict is minimal; the protagonist meets no meaningful resistance from the environment or the antagonist. The resolution lacks a visible or felt cost, as the opposing force capitulates immediately to the thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes remain abstract; Lira battles a passive "fog" that offers no active opposition or danger. There is no moment where her plan risks failure, social rejection, or physical loss, rendering the victory hollow. The conflict is resolved through a montage of success rather than a decisive, high-stakes choice that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low throughout; Marisol faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure in her experiment. The "cost" of exchanging certainty for curiosity is framed as a desirable reward rather than a painful trade-off, leaving the narrative without significant dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (evading thought taxes) remains an abstract backdrop rather than an immediate pressure in the scene. The on-page conflict—gaining entry to the club—is resolved with trivial ease, lacking an antagonist or a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely imperiled. Escalation is minimal as Elias moves smoothly from one success to the next.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.4)
    Conflict is static; the protagonist waits for centuries until an external object resolves her struggle, bypassing genuine agency. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options, as the "Blossom Armistice" arrives as a gift rather than a hard-won truce.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are high in theory (shattered equilibrium) but feel abstract in practice; the Director's opposition is overcome with a single action, and the "ghosts" never pose a visceral threat on the page. The pressure remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces slight skepticism from Henrik which immediately turns to support. The sister answers the phone and accepts the overture instantly, removing the potential for high-stakes rejection or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are abstract and declared ("fragile trust") rather than demonstrated through immediate risk. The volcano is dormant and the floodgates are holding, leaving the protagonist in a safe state where the only pressure is self-imposed and intellectual. There is no moment where Lira must trade one value for another; she simply succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.7)
    External pressure is introduced (angry clients leaving notes) but then ignored rather than confronted; the cost is abstract. The escalation relies on a "weeks passed" summary rather than scene-based intensification. The resolution comes from a dream delivering the answer, removing agency and tension from the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain largely theoretical ("memory and truth") rather than visceral, and the antagonist force (the maze) offers minimal resistance to Lira's progress. The climax resolves through a shared, calm realization rather than a pressure-cooked decision, making the final separation feel inevitable rather than a hard-won turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment is gentle ("gentle hand"), and the potential social friction with the researchers is resolved immediately with a smile and a gasp. The stakes are purely abstract ("belonging") and are never threatened or tested by failure, resulting in a vignette that lacks narrative pressure or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; the urgency is stated ("before memory faded") but lacks immediate, felt pressure or opposition on the page. The conflict is an intellectual puzzle without a visceral cost to failure, resulting in a low-tension investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; "monotony" is an abstract antagonist that offers no active resistance. The protagonist achieves her goal of ordering the crowd instantly and without obstacles, resulting in a lack of narrative tension or escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is linear and procedural; the protagonist initiates a ritual and completes it without facing active opposition or a moment of genuine doubt. The "ban" implies external danger, but the scene remains a private, safe moment of exertion, keeping the stakes theoretical rather than immediate and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or any form of escalating pressure; Elara faces no obstacles, risks, or opposing forces. The narrative is devoid of tension, as the protagonist achieves her goal immediately and without trade-off, failing the basic requirement for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no active conflict in the present scene; the protagonist walks up a hill and opens a box without facing obstacles or making difficult choices. The struggle is entirely retrospective (memories of the fire), leaving the on-page moment devoid of tension. The resolution comes from a magical external validation ("You are not broken") rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the grotto cooperates, the physics align, and the experiment succeeds without a single obstacle or setback. There is no escalation of stakes, as the protagonist faces no opposition—internal, external, or environmental—that jeopardizes her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates adequately with the groaning walls, prompting the protagonist's action. The conflict is primarily environmental and thematic; while the stakes are clear, the resolution comes rapidly after the climax, reducing the lingering sense of peril.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is external and surmountable solely through willpower; the mirrors are "stubborn" and the bells offer a time constraint, but Lirael overcomes them by simply pushing harder. There is no moment where she must trade one value for another, keeping the narrative tension relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told of "posturing" and "accusations," but the specific points of contention and the texture of the argument are glossed over. Without concrete obstacles or specific counter-moves on the page, the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal conflict—the need for grace within a life of destruction—sustains the scene. While external pressure is low (the storm is atmospheric rather than obstructive), the internal pressure to complete the ritual is sufficient. The choice to pour the last vial of water is a strong, tangible beat of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the "danger" mentioned in the exposition never materializes in the scene. The opposition ("lullaby of conformity") is distant and abstract, failing to force the protagonist into a corner or demand a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    Pressure is low. The only external opposition (the drifter's scoff) is immediately diffused by Elias agreeing ("Exactly"), removing the potential for conflict. Success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the environment, the materials, and the butterfly all cooperate perfectly with the protagonist's goal. There is no escalation of stakes, no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and no trade-off made to achieve the result.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is limited to physical stamina ("back ached," "fingers... trembled") and material resistance that yields quickly. The absence of a moment where Kael must risk failure or pay a price flattens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are stated but not felt; there is no escalation or opposition. Mara seeks an answer and receives it immediately via the hologram without obstacle, trade-off, or risk. The storm provides atmospheric noise but does not force a tactical change or impose a deadline with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story lacks visceral stakes or cost; the "low rumble" offers only token physical pressure. The climax explicitly removes the necessity of sacrifice ("not sealed with gold or blood"), deflating tension just when it should escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are low and abstract, with Lirael facing no risk of failure or personal cost for her "risky" method. The conflict resolution is repetitive; the antagonist (Kael) yields to the exact same mechanism as the first visitor, flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonists face no opposition, failure, or meaningful cost during the process. The "escalation" is merely a procedural sequence of success, lacking the friction required to give the climax weight.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is the passive decay of the setting, which offers no active resistance to the mending process. The stakes remain theoretical ("keeping the orchard alive") rather than immediate; there is no moment where failure seems possible or where a sacrifice is required to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    External pressure is nominal; the "museum board" is an abstract, off-stage threat that creates no immediate obstacle. The protagonist faces no genuine dilemma or potential for failure; she simply proceeds through the steps of the ritual. The stakes of "sanity" or "forbidden knowledge" are stated but never viscerally endangered or tested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the obstacles (spiders, Guardian) are overcome with relative ease, lacking a sense of escalating cost or genuine risk of failure. The Guardian's challenge is resolved by a single correct answer rather than a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the protagonists face no significant external opposition or internal trade-offs, merely moving from one unlocked door to the next. The "fog" and Veyra's mild complaints fail to generate sufficient pressure to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "jammed gear" offers a momentary delay rather than a true escalation or threat to the protagonist's goal. Elara faces no genuine opposition or trade-off; the solution is applied linearly without failure or adaptation, resulting in a lack of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is strictly external and environmental, with the "energy beings" serving as a passive pressure that simply increases in volume. The protagonist overcomes the obstacle through endurance rather than a difficult choice or tactical trade-off; the physical costs (aching ribs, ringing ears) are stated but do not alter her options or approach.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract; the antagonist is a passive "hush" that offers no active resistance. The resolution is unearned: a magical activation triggered by a sudden realization ("They knew") and a coincidence of weather, requiring no sacrifice or ingenuity from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and purely internal, with no visible cost or trade-off required to achieve the resolution. The epiphany arrives without significant resistance, resulting in a "soft reset" ending where the protagonist simply changes her mind without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.1)
    Tension is negligible; environmental barriers (the fortress) and internal doubts yield immediately to Lira's first attempts. There is no escalation of stakes or meaningful price paid for success, rendering the victory flat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure remains static; the "pause" in the conversation diffuses tension rather than tightening it. There is no escalation of stakes; the argument is suspended and then neatly tied up without a testing moment that forces a difficult tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are legible, and the loss of the doll provides a concrete cost to the excursion. However, the pressure remains largely external (gravity/time); the internal conflict is resolved too neatly by the convenient appearance of the sprout, softening the blow of the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely conceptual, lacking an antagonist, time limit, or concrete obstacle to force escalation. The conflict is resolved through passive observation, with no moment where the protagonist is forced to trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are high in theory ("ruin and rebirth") but abstract in practice; the protagonist solves puzzles rather than making painful trade-offs. The resolution comes from a correct answer rather than a sacrifice or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict deflates upon contact; Kael offers token resistance ("You burned that bridge") before immediately capitulating to a single sentence of explanation. There is no escalation or "crucible" moment; the stakes of the fading threshold are declared but never press the characters into a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.0)
    High physical stakes (death/implosion) are established but deflated by the ease of the resolution. The conflict between harvesting the diamonds and releasing the pressure is bypassed by the device's instructions, preventing a genuine test of the protagonist’s values.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low because the "truth" Lirael uncovers is benevolent and absolving; she faces no opposition and pays no price for the knowledge. The conflict is purely mechanical (making the machine work) followed by a gentle emotional realization. There is no moment where she must choose between two difficult paths; the "choice" to build anew is a comfortable aftermath, not a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—stasis versus change—are legible and escalate as the environment reacts to Cedric’s intent. The cost of "unsnapping" is felt in the destruction of the setting, though the protagonist's personal risk feels somewhat mitigated by the dream-like shift.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low and internal, with no external pressure or antagonist to force a difficult choice. The narrative trajectory is linear—find object, deduce history, write story—without any tightening of options or meaningful reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is external and mechanical; the protagonists face obstacles (drones, locks) but no genuine dilemmas or trade-offs. The escape is executed without significant loss or tactical adaptation, resulting in a low-stakes resolution where the "cost" of holding the line is merely caloric.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.9)
    The stakes ("The end begins") are abstract and apocalyptic, disconnected from the immediate, grounded reality of the scene. The conflict resolution—playing louder/better to banish a shadow—lacks tactical depth or a sense of escalating risk, resulting in a "beam struggle" dynamic without visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "opposition" (fading leaf markings) is overcome immediately by the magic dust without escalation or trade-offs. The stakes—decoding the message—are intellectual and resolved too easily to generate tension. There is no moment where Elinor must choose between two valid, costly paths; she simply proceeds.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low; the external obstacle is overcome by luck (the fall), and the internal conflict resolves instantly with a laugh, bypassing any "felt cost." The narrative skips the moment of testing where Elias would have to choose between fixing the compass or accepting its spin.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretically high (missing sister) but operationally low; there is no active opposition or agonizing trade-off required to summon her. The resolution relies on a ghostly visitation that dissolves the tension without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is low because the opposition (the spirit) yields immediately after Lira provides the correct philosophical answer. The stakes remain abstract ("healing requires truth") and do not threaten Lira with concrete loss or failure on the page. The conflict is resolved through agreement rather than a clash of opposing forces or values.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The internal conflict (logic vs. trauma) is resolved externally by the woman’s dialogue ("Mercy is a choice"), which deflates the tension. The protagonist accepts this new worldview without a significant on-page tradeoff or struggle, reducing the stakes of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is negligible; the primary obstacle (the lens refusing brute force) is bypassed instantly via the weaver's gift of ink. There is no antagonist, no time pressure beyond a cosmetic mention of dusk, and no meaningful trade-off or risk for Lira. The stakes remain abstract ("honoring overlooked histories") and are never tested by a concrete threat or potential loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are negligible; the ghosts are explicitly described as "not malicious," removing any sense of danger or urgency. The protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs, turning the story into a procedural discovery rather than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.7)
    Opposition is passive; while the patrons fear the whisper, they do not obstruct Elara, leaving the protagonist with no interpersonal friction. The stakes are theoretically existential, but the lack of resistance makes the "rupture" feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low because the antagonist (The Council) is reactive and easily outmaneuvered by Kael's pre-planned trap. The stakes are intellectual rather than visceral, and the protagonist pays no visible on-page price for his victory.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal to Lira but is resolved too easily through external prompting; her resistance to confessing the "truth" dissolves almost immediately upon challenge. The stakes are clear, but the lack of significant obstacles or escalating pressure makes the climax feel inevitable rather than earned. The "cost" of the confession is acknowledged but not deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the "indifferent" presence in the lagoon removes urgency, leaving Lira in the role of an observer rather than a protagonist under threat. The escalation is atmospheric rather than consequential, and the lack of a tangible cost—beyond a momentary tremble—keeps the stakes firmly in the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; Lira faces no antagonist, active time pressure, or difficult trade-offs. The &quot;conflict&quot; is resolved the moment she asks to be taught, resulting in zero escalation or tension; the storm functions as wallpaper rather than a pressure mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual without a felt cost; the lack of a compressed timeline dissipates urgency, allowing success to come from passive observation rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are clear, but the antagonist is a cardboard cutout who speaks in stock phrases ("We’re all 'them'"), reducing the tension of the final confrontation. The conflict resolution—pulling a lever while the villain monologues—lacks the visceral pressure of a contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs, merely the passage of time. Success is linear and inevitable, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the stakes ("reviving civilization") never feel genuinely imperiled.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Voss faces no external opposition and little internal resistance during the decoding process. The stakes, while conceptually high (awakening), remain abstract, and the climax—a realization triggered by listening—lacks sufficient pressure or a sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("chaos or renewal") and lack immediate pressure; the antagonist serves only as a passive gatekeeper, and the protagonist faces no active opposition. The promised cost ("a seed, a memory, a breath") is not paid on the page in a felt way, resulting in a low-tension resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are introduced ("storms will arrive sooner") and immediately deflated by the mentor's reassurance ("Not necessarily [bad]"), removing tension. The climax is a rhythmic exercise with minimal physical or emotional cost ("arms aching" is insufficient for the scale implied).

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist (Veyra) presents only mild verbal opposition and capitulates immediately at the end without a struggle. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of stakes; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles during her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no effective resistance or escalation; the ghosts are "serene" rather than pressuring, and the box provides a clear instruction that removes the difficulty of choice. The stakes ("tangled covenant") are abstract and resolved without any dramatized sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    External pressure is theoretical (static clocks) rather than immediate; the antagonist (entropy) offers no active resistance to Elias's actions. The climax lacks a felt cost; the abandonment of the urn fragment is framed as a relief rather than a difficult trade-off, flattening the emotional stakes of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.5)
    The stakes are purely abstract and aesthetic; the "discord" of a snapped string and storm debris poses no threat and demands no sacrifice. There is no escalation of pressure; Lira’s magic works instantly and perfectly, removing any tension from the central action. The lack of an opposing force or a cost for the magic leaves the narrative without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is low-resistance; the antagonist (the spirit) capitulates almost immediately after a brief exchange of dialogue. The "rumble" provides a moment of tension that is quickly dismissed ("Almost there"), failing to force a difficult trade-off or tactical shift. The stakes are high in concept (life/legacy), but the on-page struggle lacks sufficient friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes dissolve rather than escalate; the declared conflict (debunking the Enclave) is abandoned for mild curiosity without a struggle. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or trade-off, simply following the path laid out for her.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist encounters no resistance from the environment that his skills cannot instantly overcome. The "gathering storm" provides atmospheric rather than narrative pressure, and the cost of his action is abstract ("patience") rather than a felt, on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist solves every riddle instantly and correctly, facing no opposition, failure, or risk. The dominant stake ("closeness") is abstract, and the "wild hush" softens rather than tightens, leading to a frictionless progression toward a predetermined happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal conflict is legible, but the external stakes remain low; the danger of the "glimpse" feels theoretical rather than visceral. The resolution comes through a philosophical shift rather than a high-pressure trade-off, limiting the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are high (world collapse), but pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. The escalation is linear—swapping pieces triggers environmental noise—but forces no tactical pivot or sacrifice from Kael, who simply proceeds faster. The protagonist faces resistance but no true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is low-stakes; the opposition (whispers) is atmospheric and easily ignored by the protagonist's "ruthlessness." There is no visible cost to her persistence other than "faintly aching" scars, making the escalation feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are internal (memory vs. oblivion), but the external conflict in the vision is resolved too easily. The rocks falling—a sudden physical threat—are neutralized instantly by abilities Lirael discovers just in time, reducing the tension. The cost of "shards embedding in skin" is mentioned but explicitly "welcomed," mitigating the sense of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the external pressure (thunder) remains atmospheric and does not force a trade-off. The protagonist overcomes the central obstacle with patience rather than sacrifice, resulting in a resolution devoid of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.0)
    Antagonistic pressure is negligible; the elders are passive strawmen who crumble immediately upon the protagonist's action. The stakes are declared ("monolithic lies") but never tested by a credible threat that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.5)
    The external stakes (death by acid) are high, but they are undercut by a resolution that treats the threat as purely metaphorical; the sea stops because Lira feels "clear." This deflates the tension, as the pressure turns out to be illusory or obedient to the protagonist's mood rather than a genuine opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain low and purely internal, with no antagonist or environmental resistance testing Elias's resolve. The navigation of the dangerous cave is summary-smooth ("intuition humming"), removing potential tension. The resolution comes too easily, missing the tightening of options or escalation of pressure required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are established early, but the pressure evaporates the moment Thalos approves of the ritual, leaving the final act without resistance. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the external obstacle transforms into support without forcing a trade-off or price.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure that forces a hard choice. The task proceeds smoothly to success, and the "solace" she feels during the work undermines potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the introduction of the ledger, shifting from personal survival to systemic conflict. The pressure is coherent, though the antagonist ("shadowy figures") remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the woman reveals the hatch and the truth immediately upon being asked, offering no resistance. The climax involves reading a journal that explicitly explains the mystery, removing the need for deduction or struggle. The stakes are declared but the resolution comes too easily to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the stakes are stated ("unravel her stagnant life") but never tested by external opposition or genuine risk. The "creek's rise" is atmospheric rather than a ticking clock, and the climax offers a revelation without requiring a painful escalation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—the queen's emotional numbness—is clear, but the escalation is weak. The conflict is resolved through a conversation where the opposition (the figure) immediately validates and explains the protagonist's struggle, removing tension rather than heightening it. The "climb" offers physical resistance, but the emotional stakes evaporate upon contact with the entity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are clearly declared regarding the fading nexus, but the on-page conflict lacks significant escalation or deepening. The tension dissipates immediately once the new concept is introduced, turning the climax into a procedural correction rather than a high-stakes test of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the risk of "outstaying one's welcome" is mentioned but never manifests as immediate pressure. The escalation is physical (climbing the mountain), but the difficulty is glossed over in summary, stripping the beat of tension. The central conflict is resolved by a sudden shift in perspective without a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are low and purely internal, with no external pressure or opposition to Lira's investigation. The resolution (writing a compassionate note) carries no visible risk or cost on the page; if she is wrong, there is no consequence shown.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are declared ("shards that cut the caster’s soul") but never materialize as a proximate threat. The resolution lacks a visible or felt cost; Kael expects pain but receives a "wave of warmth" and applause from the trees. Without a price paid for the magic—physical, emotional, or resources—the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and resolves with relatively low resistance; Elias hesitates, Clara encourages him, and he succeeds. While the ghost's accusation ("You left me") raises the emotional stakes, the resolution (simply playing the song louder/to completion) feels like a "magic button" solution rather than a difficult choice involving sacrifice or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are high-concept ("cosmic illusions") but low-pressure, as the protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure or meaningful opposition. The climax resolves via a swift internal alignment that bypasses the need for tactical ingenuity or loss, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Tension builds effectively through the rhythmic countdown and the atmospheric pressure of the "silence" and the key's transformation. However, the stakes remain largely abstract and philosophical; without a concrete opposing force or a tangible sacrifice, the conflict feels lower stakes than the cosmic imagery suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist (the system) yields without a fight, effectively inviting the protagonist to solve it. Stakes are declared ("dying heart") but never felt, as the solution is applied effortlessly in a single beat. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is the primary weakness; obstacles dissolve quickly (Greer helps, the tracks act as a simple fork), and the stakes feel abstract ("widen perspectives") rather than urgent. The climax is a decoding task rather than a pressure-cooker choice requiring sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is negligible; deep trauma (dead sister, lost mother) is resolved with single, frictionless interactions, reducing stakes to triviality. The lack of opposition or failure means the protagonist's agency is never truly tested, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are declared ("weight of empires") but the on-page pressure is low. The protagonist explicitly notes that survival requires "only attention" rather than sacrifice, which negates the potential for felt cost or high-tension trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared ("cure for loneliness") but lack escalation; there is no significant opposition or reversal. The climax involves the antagonist (the conductor) voluntarily removing the conflict and delivering a lesson, which deflates tension rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.9)
    Escalation is weak; obstacles (vibrating leaves, cold water) are minor inconveniences rather than tests of character. The climax involves walking "for hours, days" in summary rather than a dramatized confrontation or sacrifice. The protagonist pays no on-page price for his success.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are high in theory (a girl's life), but the on-page tension is deflated by Lira, who functions as a safety valve providing the answers. Elias does not face a dilemma where he must sacrifice something tangible; he simply accepts a better philosophy, lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared ("silence becomes a prison") but never tested; the environment and secondary characters offer zero opposition. The narrative is a procession rather than a conflict; Lira joins immediately, the crowd is rapt, and the "disruption" happens without cost or risk, deflating the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.0)
    The protagonist faces no active opposition; the archive yields instantly to her efforts, and the resolution arrives without any visible or felt cost. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved by magic rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict is internal but static; the protagonist waits until a secondary character appears to explain the solution ("Drum with me"). This removes agency from the protagonist, as the resolution comes from following instructions rather than making a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are low (a bet for money/bragging rights) and the protagonist faces no true peril; he smiles through the danger, diffusing tension. The resolution is achieved through a convenient discovery rather than a difficult trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain purely abstract and thematic; there is no immediate consequence if Lira fails her ritual. The fisherman offers a potential source of friction, but he is ignored and walks away, diffusing the only source of tension instantly. The "stillwater tension" is stated by the narrator but never substantiated by narrative pressure or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are internal but low-pressure; Clara holds all the cards and simply dispenses wisdom that Lila accepts without resistance. There is no moment where options narrow or a difficult choice must be made; the conflict is resolved through a linear reveal of past connection followed by off-page gameplay.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Lira faces no physical or psychological obstacles in the water, and the whale's immediate benevolence removes potential tension. The "violence" driving the plot is relegated to backstory and never tested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely internal and retrospective; the "enforcement teams" are a backstory element rather than a present threat. There is little on-page resistance to Lirael's action; the scene is a meditation rather than a struggle with high stakes. The lack of an immediate opposing force or a difficult trade-off makes the "rebellion" feel safe and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the ban, the elements, or her own limitations. The escalation is purely aesthetic—the magic simply gets stronger—lacking the tension of a "no" that must be overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    While stakes are raised by the vision of the phoenix, the interpersonal conflict dissolves almost immediately into agreement. The climax relies on a thematic explanation ("I gave it imperfection") that defuses tension rather than forcing the protagonist to make a difficult, pressure-filled choice regarding the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract; while the goal is research, failure carries no visible penalty, and the "grid collapse" remains background noise without exerting pressure. The protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma; the environment yields its secrets immediately upon request, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared ("redemption") but lack immediate pressure; the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without material failure or distinct trade-offs. The conflict remains internal and is resolved through realization rather than a high-stakes decision with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the interaction is a master-apprentice vignette where the apprentice offers no resistance. The "escalation" consists of deepening the explanation rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. There is no visible cost to Elara’s success, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared ("corruption," "broken world") but never materialized or tested on the page; Lirael faces no actual risk or trade-off. The conflict remains purely verbal and philosophical, resolving instantly when she ignores the warning, rendering the antagonist's pressure negligible and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared as high (the end of hope) but remain abstract and distant throughout the scene. The conflict is resolved without escalation or sacrifice; Lirael faces no moment where she must lose something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.9)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the stakes are set in the first paragraph and resolved in the last without a new variable or intensification in the middle. The antagonist is a memory, and the physical task offers no resistance, resulting in a flat pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are internal and clear, but the escalation lacks pressure on the protagonist's agency; she is a passenger on a ride through memory. The climax resolves the central conflict (grief/trauma) by promising a painless future ("a life where she carried her scars with pride"), which sidesteps the necessary cost of genuine healing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the external storm is background noise, and the internal quest faces no resistance or risk of failure. The protagonist simply touches an object and receives the answer she seeks. Without an escalation of stakes or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the narrative lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the archway yields its secrets the moment Kael tries. The stakes ("trapped creativity") are abstract and never threatened by a concrete counter-force or time pressure in the scene. The ending lacks the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (the death of imagination) are high, but the conflict lacks active opposition; the guide provides the solution, and Kael executes it without facing a significant obstacle or cost. The resolution comes too easily, missing the "meaningful tightening" or trade-off required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no felt opposition or risk of failure, making the outcome feel inevitable. The story lacks a tightening of tension—Elara simply proceeds from point A to point B without facing a dilemma or paying a significant price.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is negligible; the environment shifts to accommodate the protagonists rather than obstructing them. The stakes are philosophical rather than immediate or felt; there is no antagonist or difficult trade-off required to reach the clearing. The final cost—leaving the heirloom punch—is symbolic but lacks emotional weight because the attachment was not dramatized under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.8)
    The inciting incident (Lady Veyra's scream) creates initial pressure, but the escalation is internal and abstract. Elric faces no genuine opposition other than a self-imposed rule, which he discards too easily. The climax lacks a sense of risk, as the resolution is achieved through a didactic speech rather than a difficult trade-off or action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is no meaningful escalation or antagonism; the protagonist bypasses guards via "temple secrets" (hand-waving) and defeats the villain with a single attack. The stakes are declared but never tested, as Veyra encounters no failure or partial success that forces a change in tactics. The resolution is unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is introduced but barely engaged; Kael dismisses the data and then converts to Lira's side immediately upon seeing the lights, removing all tension from the climax. The stakes shift from scientific validation to survival/exploration without forcing a costly tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("rebellion had stalled") but dissolved by a miracle rather than escalated through pressure or choice. There is no visible price paid for success; the protagonist waits, and the environment solves the problem, negating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is static; with no antagonist, time pressure, or opposing force present, the protagonist's path is unobstructed, and the final decision imposes no visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.7)
    One dominant stake (mental stability) is clear, and the wind serves as an effective situational trigger. However, the escalation is dampened by the immediate availability of a wise mentor who explains the solution. The conflict resolves through a therapeutic breakthrough that feels somewhat lowered in stakes by the safety of the guided interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (sanity/existence vs. crushing reality) is clear, and the "walls closing in" provides escalating pressure. However, the resolution via magical painting feels convenient; the protagonist solves the physical/existential threat with a symbolic action that lacks a distinct, gritty price.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist faces minimal resistance; she ignores warnings, the magic ink works instantly, and the door opens without struggle. The lack of failure, trade-offs, or difficult choices prevents any meaningful escalation of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are declared ("contraband truths") but remain abstract and theoretical; the "Council" is an off-screen boogeyman that exerts no immediate pressure on the scene. There is no on-page antagonist or ticking clock to force a difficult trade-off, resulting in a conflict that resolves instantly upon the rebel's awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.3)
    Pressure is virtually absent; the sandstorm is "in the distance" and the looters are a memory, leaving Lira in safety without a forcing mechanism. The dominant stake is abstract (finding meaning), and the lack of an active threat or time constraint prevents meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.7)
    The external stakes (stabilizing the garden vs. entropy) are clear, but the conflict lacks significant interpersonal or internal resistance. The personal cost to Kael is technically present (loss of the goddess), but his easy acceptance and final smile undercut the sense of sacrifice required for higher impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes are theoretically high but dramatically flat because Clara faces no genuine temptation to bury the truth; the "smoking gun" removes ambiguity, making her choice immediate and easy rather than a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the digital ghost offers no resistance ("Follow the cries"), removing all tension from the climax. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or narrowing of options, proceeding in a straight line to success.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the stated risk of "unraveling the emergent hush" is overcome by a brief moment of hesitation with no negative consequence. The stakes remain abstract, and the resolution comes without sacrifice or significant opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is no active opposition or meaningful escalation; Elias faces no obstacles in completing his ritual. The stakes are abstract ("rename the world") while the on-page action (placing a tile) is low-risk, resulting in a lack of tension or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the "fractured" state resolves immediately upon his intervention. There is no escalation of stakes or narrowing of options, merely a linear progression of success that lacks tension or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The external pressure (recall notice) is introduced but quickly sidelined; Mara becomes a passive observer rather than an active obstacle. The stakes are intellectual rather than visceral, as the breakthrough occurs in a montage without the risk of failure or a steep trade-off being dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract ("voice of the unknown") with no immediate consequence for failure; Lira faces no opposition or genuine risk, rendering the climax a foregone conclusion devoid of tension or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; Mara finds the jar immediately and solves its puzzle without failure, adaptation, or sacrifice. The antagonist is abstract ("time"), and the stakes remain theoretical, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of escalation or genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    External pressure is negligible; the "creak of the railing" is a false alarm that deflates tension immediately. The internal conflict is resolved through assertion rather than struggle, and the stakes remain abstract ("poison" of secrets) without immediate on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or tension; the protagonist waits, boards, rides, and pays without opposition or obstacle. No stakes are raised or tested, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory with no meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under a Situational lens where understanding is the goal, and the deepening of that understanding is effective. However, immediate narrative tension is low; Mara faces no active opposition or risk of failure in the present moment. The stakes are high conceptually (survival of kindness) but low viscerally for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are low and purely thematic; there is no meaningful opposition or escalation, as Mara accepts Elias’s intervention immediately. The conflict is resolved through a "symmetric satisfaction" where a simple gesture cures deep grief, lacking the friction or trade-offs required for drama.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal without a concrete test or opposition to force escalation. The rising action is atmospheric (the hum gets louder) rather than causal, and the resolution arrives without a felt sacrifice or risk to the protagonist's safety or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are low; the central obstacle is a brief hesitation resolved immediately by a bird's trill (pathetic fallacy) rather than a difficult choice. There is no visible cost or trade-off paid to achieve the resolution, rendering the victory slight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.5)
    The conflict lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist (the tricksters) surrenders instantly upon Lila's first attempt to interfere, rendering the stakes theoretical. There is no on-page cost or trade-off required to achieve victory, merely the execution of a technical skill.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are abstract ("vital key") and lack personal or conceptual weight beyond the immediate acquisition of the MacGuffin. The conflict resolves too easily with the compass, bypassing the potential for a difficult trade-off or genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is minimal; Voss offers token resistance ("This isn't evidence") that evaporates instantly upon Clara's first intuitive leap. The stakes are stated ("cold case") but not felt, as the solution is handed to the protagonist through luck and supernatural intuition rather than struggle, sacrifice, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are legible (truth vs. safety), but the escalation is undermined by the timeline compression. The Director's interruption arrives with convenient timing solely to force the climax rather than growing causally from the delay.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.9)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no resistance, difficult trade-offs, or escalation before succeeding. The resolution arrives immediately upon the decision to play, lacking the necessary tightening of stakes or visible cost required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no active stakes or pressure in the present moment; the conflict is retrospective and the antagonist (the founders) never appears on the page. The resolution relies on the implausible mechanism of the "territorial markers" working perfectly without resistance, devoid of escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the loss of the map and the memory of the brother. The "erasing inscriptions" introduces effective time pressure. However, the conflict is resolved with relative ease; the "burden" of the temple is described as heavy but accepted by Lirael almost immediately upon entry, minimizing the felt cost of the struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes collapse rather than tighten. The conflict is built on a misunderstanding of the past; once the magic seed corrects the memory, the conflict evaporates without requiring sacrifice or trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension evaporates in the climax, replaced by a didactic conversation with a mirror-self that explains the solution. The setup promises a painful sacrifice ("accept the pain of both worlds"), but the happy ending negates this cost entirely, rendering the stakes retroactively hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal. The Keeper is helpful rather than obstructive, the needle pierces "easily," and the fruit is given freely. There is no moment where Lirael must sacrifice something she genuinely wants to keep or face a risk of failure; the narrative path is smooth and devoid of jagged, testing edges.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure is minimal; Gus leaves without forcing a hard choice, leaving the stakes purely internal and low-risk. The resolution comes too easily—the protagonist gains purpose without paying a price, facing a significant obstacle, or making a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment poses no active threat, and the task proceeds without failure or reversal. The stakes remain abstract ("responsibility"), and the lack of an antagonist or time pressure results in a low-tension experience.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.1)
    Pressure is negligible; the Woman hesitates for a single line before the magic system resolves her problem instantly. There is no on-page cost or sacrifice—she enters the creel and emerges "lighter" without paying a price for the change.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist faces no active opposition, danger, or difficult trade-offs until the final beat. The stakes are theoretical until the magical resolution retroactively validates them. The "hesitation" is stated as a plot point but does not arise from a dramatized dilemma or genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are internal (sanity/forgiveness), but the conflict lacks resistance; Mara accepts the graffiti’s wisdom immediately without struggle or doubt. The escalation is linear and low-pressure, leading to a realization that feels inevitable rather than earned through a confrontation with hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared ("weight of time," "storm on the horizon") but never tested by immediate opposition or genuine setbacks. The puzzle yields to a single attempt at graphing data, lacking the tightening pressure or escalation where the protagonist must pay a price to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict between two futures (Empire vs. Garden) is clear and escalates through the visions. The cost of the choice is made legible via the "perforated destiny" concept and the physical destruction of the violin. However, because the allure of the throne is only visualized rather than deeply felt as a temptation, the stakes feel somewhat theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure escalates nicely with the cracking pool, but the tension evaporates immediately upon the application of the lullaby. The protagonist faces no trade-off or lasting consequence, resulting in a low-stakes resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict or pressure in the scene; the tension is retrospective and dissolves immediately upon Elara's gesture. The stakes (contentment) are abstract, and the resolution comes without escalation, risk, or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are present for the client but minimal for Elias, who faces no significant opposition or cost in performing his service. The resolution—unhooking a chime—feels like a completed task rather than a hard-won victory, lacking visceral tightening or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are purely intellectual; while Lira's "desperation" is mentioned, there is no visible cost to failure for either character on the page. Elara's withholding is a pedagogical choice with no personal risk, and the "burning" in Lira's chest remains a metaphor rather than a pressure forcing a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract and philosophical, lacking immediate physical or relational danger. Kael faces no active opposition, time pressure, or setbacks; he simply waits, observes, and succeeds, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no on-page conflict; the spire acts as a vending machine for the protagonist's enlightenment. Stakes are abstract and theoretical, with no potential cost for failure shown or felt in the scene. The narrative lacks escalation, offering a flat line of unearned successes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is internal and atmospheric rather than active; Elias faces no significant external obstacles or difficult choices after entering the water. The climax (reading the book) is a passive reception of a miracle rather than a triumph of agency, and the cost (leaving the key) feels symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract ("distill meaning"), and the conflict lacks a true antagonist or risk of failure. The protagonist succeeds immediately upon focusing, with no meaningful reversals, forced trade-offs, or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist force (the resisting echoes) is overcome immediately with a single sentence, lacking genuine escalation. The stakes remain abstract ("solace," "naming fears") without a concrete, immediate threat to the protagonist's safety or goal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are established early (cosmic rift), but the on-page pressure consists largely of waiting and minor adjustments, lacking a visceral escalation of cost. Marla functions as a skeptic but offers little genuine resistance, resulting in a climax that feels intellectually solved rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story suffers from telescopic stakes: the imminent failure of the dam—a catastrophic physical event—is countered by the symbolic act of placing photographs. While the thematic intent is clear, the lack of physical urgency or consequence regarding the crumbling infrastructure makes the conflict feel abstract. The resolution ignores the lethal weight of the water for a metaphorical victory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are abstract and theoretical; the threat of failure is never felt. The escalation attempts a physical cost (burning the hand), but the protagonist "not flinching" minimizes the impact, turning it into a cool pose rather than a felt sacrifice. The resolution comes too easily, dissolving tension without a lingering price.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared as world-ending ("arbor would unravel"), but the on-page pressure is minimal, restricted to sweat and a "burden." The conflict is entirely external and resolved by competence; Kael faces no agonizing trade-off or significant obstacle that tests his resolve beyond simple exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared (existence/soul) but the escalation feels mechanical, moving from verbal sparring to energy beams to a metaphorical merge. The climax lacks a felt price; the protagonist gains everything (victory, emotional wholeness) without a corresponding sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low and largely abstract (curiosity rather than threat); the seed poses no immediate danger, and the "panic" mentioned is fleeting and resolved quickly. The escalation relies on magical acceleration (rapid growth) rather than increased antagonist pressure or dwindling resources, resulting in a conflict that feels low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.6)
    The conflict is limited to physical stamina versus a static environment, lacking interpersonal or internal stakes that would force a trade-off. The escalation is quantitative—he simply tries harder—rather than qualitative, resulting in a flat pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict (duty vs. home) is clear, and the stakes are personal. However, the antagonist poses little active threat beyond posturing, and his defeat (collapsing after the key is tossed) feels spatially disconnected from Mara's action. The tension is largely atmospheric rather than driven by escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (destiny vs. stagnation) and the cost (scarred hands, blood sacrifice) is paid on the page. However, the escalation is compressed; the obstacle of the metal's resistance is overcome quickly, and the shift to self-sacrifice feels like a standard genre trope rather than a unique pressure point specific to this story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.7)
    Opposition is minimal; the tower's resistance is overcome quickly by a single, relatively low-stakes action of dismantling wires. The stakes remain abstract (finding a "beginning"), and the physical cost (a seared palm) feels token rather than a significant price paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.3)
    The stakes are declared as existential ("unravel reality itself") but lack on-page weight; Kael agrees to the risk with a simple "Okay" and no visible hesitation or sacrifice. The conflict resolves smoothly through the radio interaction, lacking the friction or cost required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are theoretical ("unraveling her own sanity") and do not manifest in concrete danger or difficult trade-offs on the page. The conflict is resolved by the environment reacting benevolently to the protagonist's action, removing the need for a hard decision. There is no visible cost paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are purely pedagogical; the student's question ("What if they change?") offers a moment of pressure, but Lirael resolves it immediately with a philosophical answer. The story lacks genuine opposition or the risk of failure required to escalate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are stated as "heavier" but fail to generate tension, as the obstacles (walking to a room, listening) offer no genuine resistance. The resolution arrives via a magical coincidence (the synchronized aids) rather than a hard trade-off or escalation of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Physical escalation is present via the rising tide, but the protagonist's victory comes with minimal cost; she achieves her goal and escapes intact. The stakes remain external, and the resolution feels unearned by significant sacrifice or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict with OBS-7 provides clear external pressure that forces Elias to define his existence. The stakes are intelligible (identity/validity), but the "tightening" is largely philosophical; the cost of the error remains a background clerical issue rather than an immediate, escalating threat in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure remains largely abstract and intellectual until the final paragraphs, where the environment suddenly turns hostile. The "fear of oblivion" is stated as a stake but not dramatized in the buildup, making the climax feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are well-defined, escalating from observation to physical peril and identity loss. The climax works well, but the tension deflates quickly when the artifact resolves the entrapment without a more difficult, active tradeoff from the protagonist in the moment of escape.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.8)
    Opposition is passive; the statues function as environmental obstacles that freeze and crumble rather than active antagonists forcing hard trade-offs. The stakes are declared (order vs. chaos) but the conflict lacks a dynamic back-and-forth; Lira wins by persistence without paying a meaningful narrative price. There is no moment where she must sacrifice something of value to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the stakes are declared in the exposition ("disputed territory") but never tested in the scene. The protagonist encounters no active resistance, and the resolution is instantaneous, lacking any escalation or tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation. Elio finds the key immediately, finds the door immediately, and his singing works instantly to transform the space. Lacking opposition or the risk of failure, the story flatlines; the "climax" is merely a procedure carried out without stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are abstract ("silence had grown heavier") and meet no active resistance; the protagonist succeeds in her ritual immediately and completely. The absence of an antagonist, internal barrier, or felt cost drains the narrative of genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract ("cipher of longing") and lack concrete on-page pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The climax resolves instantly via the dream-entity’s dialogue, bypassing the need for a decisive, cost-bearing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are theoretical ("reshape reality") rather than visceral, and the antagonist force (fear/the lock) offers minimal resistance. The climax resolves instantly upon insertion of the pick, lacking the escalation or cost required to make the victory feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Elias faces no active opposition, and the puzzle yields to him without a struggle or trade-off. The stakes remain abstract (satisfying curiosity) rather than visceral. The climax lacks a moment of hard choice; he simply opens a locket and receives affirmation, bypassing the need for courage, sacrifice, or ingenuity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared ("village is dying") but the conflict lacks on-page pressure; the protagonist offers a solution and the visitor accepts it immediately without struggle or doubt. The ease of resolution deflates the tension established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are established early ("color of wonder"), but the conflict is abstract (entropy vs. magic) and lacks a tangible antagonist or internal doubt. The escalation is mild—climbing a mossy wall and cutting a branch—and the resolution is instant and total ("dissonance resolved"), lacking a sense of difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("risk unleashing the noise") but never tested against a concrete obstacle; the "fear" is mentioned but dismissed immediately without forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.7)
    Tension is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition or significant risk of failure. The process of opening the henge is a smooth execution of prepared steps (film, sextant, water) rather than a struggle against resistance, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, lacking external pressure, time constraints, or a tangible antagonist. The climax hinges on the convenient resonance between a tuning fork and a snow globe rather than an escalated struggle or earned tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict; the storm arrives, but the narrator explicitly states "Elias didn't flinch," negating the only potential source of external pressure. The internal stakes are retrospective and safe, with no risk of failure or exposure. The "ghost" is a passive receptacle for messages, offering no resistance or demand.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes evaporate the moment they are tested; the widow, established as an obstacle who forbids mention of the crash, accepts the revelation immediately without conflict. There is no felt cost to Mara’s decision, resulting in a low-tension narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The external pressure (drifting) and internal pressure (need for validation) are present, but the conflict with Voss remains static. The stakes feel largely theoretical until the final surrender, which effectively crystallizes Lila’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    The external pressure (demolition) drives the pace, but the timeline confusion muddies the urgency. The stakes remain largely thematic; while Lira makes a choice to alter her painting, the personal cost is low, and the "demolition at midnight" undermines the established ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake is low-pressure; the Captain is a caricature obstacle who shouts but does not impede. The climax involves no sacrifice or trade-off—she jumps, succeeds, and returns safely, rendering the risk negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.7)
    Escalation is absent; Kael enters, locates the target, and solves the puzzle immediately with a resource he brought with him. The environment exerts pressure in description only, not in action or choice obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no active conflict; the settlers briefly "debate" in summary before immediately cooperating. The stakes are declared ("arches would collapse") but never felt through difficulty or failure, and the resolution comes without any visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are globally high (doomsday), but the immediate opposition is abstract (the difficulty of the task) rather than active. The pressure escalates adequately via the environment (fog, vibrating glass), but the protagonist's victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates effectively through the closing distance of the mechanical birds and the encroaching frost. The stakes are palpable, and the climax forces a decisive risk (opening the door/shoving the traveler) that carries the "felt cost" of the labyrinth's shuddering displeasure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict resolves with minimal resistance; Mara accepts the chrysalis metaphor and the apology almost instantly. The lack of pushback or friction in the studio scene makes the reconciliation feel unearned, resulting in low visible cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.6)
    Tension dissipates almost immediately after the antagonist leaves; the "warning" about the jar never manifests as an on-page complication for Elara. The dominant stake (the danger of the unwritten story) is intellectualized rather than dramatized, and the resolution comes without conflict or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    The internal conflict is rigorously developed, with the "cost" of the magic legible in Nessar’s physical reaction and the lingering weight of the founder's guilt. The external conflict is less successful; the guard incident is a missed opportunity for escalation, resolved too conveniently to add genuine pressure. The story succeeds because the internal deepening—choosing to dilute the remorse by sharing it—carries sufficient weight to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of genuine opposition; the weight resists for a moment and then yields to a song, and the societal rift vanishes upon the clock's activation. Without the risk of failure or a visible trade-off, the stakes remain abstract and the victory feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal and technical, lacking visceral stakes on the page. The "risk" of the feedback loop is stated ("threatened to overwhelm him") but resolved quickly by gritting teeth; the escalation lacks a moment where Kael is forced to sacrifice something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are low and purely procedural; the time limit (57 minutes) is mentioned but does not force a difficult trade-off or frantic adaptation. The protagonist meets no active opposition or internal resistance, resulting in a lack of escalation; the climax is a successful navigation manoeuvre rather than a test of will or values.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.7)
    The conflict is Man vs. Nature, but Nature offers no active resistance, resulting in a struggle defined only by physical exertion. The stakes remain abstract ("silence") until the final cost of the broken tool, lacking a moment where failure felt like a distinct possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("terms erased") and the conflict is strictly intellectual, lacking visceral danger or urgency. The escalation is environmental (glowing stone, humming nexus) rather than driven by the protagonist's decisions, leading to a low-pressure resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are theoretical; there is no immediate consequence for failing to open the diary before the fireworks start. The conflict is purely mechanical (a lock) and is resolved without significant struggle, adaptation, or loss, leaving the narrative devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is nominal; the elders' warnings never manifest as physical obstacles, and their skepticism vanishes conveniently at the end. The resolution lacks a felt price or sacrifice from the protagonist, relying on the inevitable passage of time.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; while the environment is chaotic, Lira faces no difficult trade-off or personal risk beyond generic flight danger. The resolution—plugging in a key—is a mechanical fix that requires no sacrifice, leaving the final victory unearned and without felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared but not enacted; the "hungry machine" offers wind resistance but no targeted antagonism, allowing an easy exit. The conflict remains largely external and environmental, lacking a decisive turning point where the protagonist must trade something of value to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder is essential—faces no concrete opposition; the "oppressive" silence yields immediately to Lira's song. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of risk, only a seamless progression to a perfect resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalated through the failure of the music and the destruction of the relic. The cost is tangible—the unique flute is broken—and the resolution requires a genuine shift in stance (surrender) rather than a magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are primarily internal and remain abstract until the climax, where the external threat (the chaotic machine) is resolved too easily. The protagonist confronts the fragment, but the "wildfire" of emotion is tamed instantly by his realization, removing the sense of genuine danger or trade-off. The ending lacks a felt cost, as order is restored without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low and vague; the consequence of being "late" is never established. The conflict is minimal, resolved by obedience to an external authority figure rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are established early (proving the theory/self-validation) and the pressure escalates appropriately. The resolution brings a clear internal cost—the destruction of her cherished theory—marked by the "bitter and free" laughter. The conflict resolves cleanly under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—silence versus connection—is clear and stakes are raised through the resistance of the puzzle. The cost of the resolution is visible (loss of the heirloom), though the "crow" obstacle feels like a standard complication rather than a deep escalation of the premise. The final trade-off is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.7)
    Global stakes are declared (planet dying) but the personal cost is transient and symbolic; Jorin endures pain for a moment and emerges unscathed to a perfect world. The obstacle—spectral shards—is overcome through passive endurance rather than active ingenuity or sacrifice that alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are personal, centering on the loss of a parent, but the on-page conflict is minimal. The antagonist is the abstract "pull" of the shard, and the climax—a conversation where the mother grants him permission to let go—lacks resistance or a forced trade-off. The resolution comes too easily; Kael renounces the shard without struggling against the temptation to stay, lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative establishes high physical stakes (lost ships, failing light) but resolves them with low-stakes internal comfort (stacking stones). This shift deflates the tension, as the protagonist merely accepts a symbolic substitute for safety without paying a price or facing the consequences of the darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the "chaos" and "darkness" are described but never force a difficult trade-off or tactical shift. The conflict is external and atmospheric (Man vs. Destiny) without a specific, dramatized price paid by the protagonist to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("understand why some lives became vessels for legend") and the pressure is low; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle to Lin's action. The escalation is visual (light gets brighter) rather than a deepening of risk or consequence until the sudden loss of the wing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is negligible conflict; the external pressure (storm, presence, pin drop) creates atmosphere but does not force a difficult trade-off or deepen the stakes. The protagonist succeeds at his task without failing, adapting, or paying a price, resulting in a flat trajectory where the "dominant stake" is never truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no escalation or obstacle; the protagonist identifies a solution and executes it without failure, setback, or risk. The stakes are global (dying realm) but the on-page pressure is minimal. The cost (exhaustion) is a told aftereffect rather than a price paid during the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    Opposition is virtually absent; the society, the book, and the leader yield to Eleanor immediately, offering no pushback to test her resolve. Without obstacles or the risk of rejection, the stakes remain theoretical, and the climax feels like a gift rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("spiritual dissatisfaction") and lack visceral urgency. The antagonist is the vague concept of "normality," and Elias faces no significant opposition or failure state; success is immediate and gentle, resulting in very low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the stakes are high (oblivion), the conflict is external and linear, lacking a meaningful trade-off or dilemma. The protagonist faces no moral or tactical choice that requires sacrifice; she simply executes her task with more intensity, which flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear and escalate well; the protagonist must sacrifice a sentimental object (the fob) to achieve her goal. The climax offers a sharp thematic twist—the device reveals the father’s weakness—complicating the victory and adding genuine emotional weight to the destruction of the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (intellectual curiosity) until the physical cost of the "blood" taste, which is a strong moment. However, the tension dissipates immediately when Lira appears to explain the mystery, robbing the protagonist of the agency to resolve the conflict or interpret the phenomenon himself.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal ("soul starved of color") without manifesting as a concrete obstacle or opponent in the scene. The escalation is atmospheric rather than conflict-driven; Elias faces no genuine risk of failure, and his success requires no visible sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict creates coherent pressure, particularly through the quill’s detection of lies. However, the climax de-escalates tension too smoothly; the Keeper’s immediate agreement ("You're right") and the protagonist's quick acceptance of the "seed" lower the stakes of the confrontation. The cost—losing the mother's actual words—is felt but softened by the swift resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.2)
    Dominant stakes are virtually absent; there is no opposing force or obstacle preventing Elara from achieving her goal. The arrival of visitors creates no conflict or dilemma, and the melting of the ice is a natural process rather than a source of escalating narrative tension or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; the threat of "overwhelming" chaos is told, not shown through degradation of function or critical failure. The climax lacks escalation—Clara applies a solution (fire) that works instantly, resolving the central problem without forcing a trade-off or sacrifice. The ending offers a "soft reset" where the cost is reframed as a gain ("static... like a song") rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are limited to mild curiosity with no potential for loss; the protagonist risks nothing. The resolution relies on a sudden epiphany involving information not in evidence, removing any sense of struggle or earned escalation. The obstacles vanish without exacting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The physical threat (drones) is resolved by a thematic gesture (dancing) rather than a causal one, stripping the climax of genuine stakes. The antagonist is defeated by a metaphor, rendering the danger moot.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist overcomes the primary obstacle (gravity fluctuations) merely by "clinging to the pattern" and walking forward. There is no moment where he must sacrifice something of value or make a difficult trade-off to succeed; the resolution comes too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.3)
    There is no effective opposition; the brook ripples momentarily, but the summoner succeeds instantly. The "prophecy" is a passive threat that exerts no active pressure during the scene. The lack of a difficult choice or failure risk flattens the dramatic arc completely.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition, difficult trade-off, or active antagonist. The transition from scholar to ritualist is frictionless, depriving the climax of necessary tension or a felt cost beyond a theoretical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved too easily by the ritual. The memory "hitting her like a physical blow" is a standard trope that doesn't escalate into a genuine dilemma; she simply chooses to release it, and the magic obeys. The "burning but not hurting" sensation explicitly negates physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared ("empires built on lies") rather than tested; the conflict remains abstract and distant. The immediate tension—the thorn’s curse—is resolved quickly with a single prick, missing an opportunity to escalate the physical or emotional cost of the forgery on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.4)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the ascent is "sure-footed" and the environment offers no resistance. Stakes remain abstract ("truth") and are never tested on the page with visible risk or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks active resistance or stakes; the "mystery" resolves itself through a sequence of visions that arrive without effort or cost. There is no moment where Kael's goal is genuinely threatened, leading to a flat narrative arc with no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story lacks a central conflict, antagonist, or obstacle; Kael encounters no resistance to his observations, making the stakes effectively zero. The climax involves a low-risk gesture (waving a whisk) that does not foreclose any options or demand a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are legible, but the antagonist that allegedly stopped Crane is absent for Mara, reducing the climax to a procedural action. The escalation is largely informational (reading letters) rather than a series of pressured on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are telescopic and abstract: the fate of a "new dawn" versus a storm, with no immediate, grounded threat to the protagonist's safety or values. There is little genuine conflict; the storm is a backdrop, and the "voices" are helpful guides rather than antagonistic forces. The lack of tough trade-offs makes the escalation feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no resistance from the magic, the environment, or society. The "gleaned redemption" is achieved without struggle or sacrifice, resulting in a low-stakes vignette rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is weak; the antagonist’s immediate capitulation upon the first attempt at harmonization deflates tension. The conflict resolves without a significant trade-off, deepening, or visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are abstract and low; failure costs nothing but a moment of time, and the concept of "revolution" remains distant. The conflict resolves linearly with a single successful attempt, lacking the escalation or deep complications required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes are high, the central conflict is resolved through the discovery of the files rather than the protagonist's agency or ingenuity. The antagonist's pressure is felt, but the confrontation occurs via a hallucinatory monologue rather than a tangible interplay of choices, lowering the immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist's skepticism serves as a straw man that collapses immediately upon seeing the art. There is no meaningful tightening of options or true test of the protagonist's values.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (proving the theory vs. failure), and the acid mist provides a ticking clock that forces the protagonist to act. However, the escalation is largely external and mechanical; the sacrifice of the arrow tip is a valid plot cost, but the emotional weight of losing her "compass" is glossed over in favor of immediate triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are clearly established (truth vs. erasure), and the external conflict with Hale provides functional pressure. However, the escalation is standard, and the antagonist's dialogue is stock villainy ("oily with false sympathy").

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is absent; Elara faces no obstacle she cannot instantly overcome with a wave of her hand. The resolution is unearned, lacking the "visible or felt cost" required for valid closure; the storm is simply soothed by magic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.0)
    The external conflict resolves too easily—"Help me pull" leads immediately to success without complication, failure, or significant cost. The high stakes of the euthanasia plan are dropped rather than confronted or paid off; the rescue acts as a coincidence that solves the internal problem without a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared ("I feel nothing") but never tested against opposition; Lila accepts Elias's reframing immediately. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options or a felt price for the resolution, resulting in a low-tension "conversation cure."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the story lacks an antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental resistance. The "sages demand consecration" acts as a prompt instruction rather than a source of tension. The ritual succeeds on the first attempt with only "sweat beading" as a token physical marker, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist lingers, thinks, and reaches a conclusion without external opposition or difficult trade-offs. The "stakes" are purely abstract concepts ("collective healing"), and the resolution comes without any visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes remain purely philosophical and abstract ("truth hidden in the library’s bones"). There is no tangible opposition or risk; the "colleagues who would dismiss his theories" are hypothetical and off-page. The "testimony" is redefined as a metaphor, removing the potential for external conflict or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal with minimal external pressure; the central obstacle is overcome largely by waiting for the fog to clear rather than a decisive, high-cost tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pressure is coherent and escalates effectively through the spinning hand and tremors. The physical danger forces a clear change in tactics, though the solution (singing) resolves the conflict a bit too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is minimal conflict; the patient and daughter comply immediately with Mira's interventions, and the "war" between fear and faith is told rather than shown. The stakes are declared ("flawless goodbye") but never threatened by failure or unforeseen obstacles, resulting in a flat escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.7)
    There are virtually no stakes beyond curiosity. The story lacks an antagonist, a ticking clock (other than a brief celestial alignment), or a consequence for failure. The protagonist faces no opposition and pays no price for her success beyond "bloodshot eyes."

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict evaporates the moment Elias appears and voluntarily provides the solution, removing all narrative pressure. There is no struggle or meaningful trade-off; the stakes are declared in backstory but never tested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (creating/sharing light) is clear, but obstacles are overcome instantly; the "rough" glass polishes quickly, and the weighing test succeeds immediately. The lack of a difficult trade-off or risk of failure keeps the pressure low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low throughout; while the "viral confession" provides a backstory of external stress, it does not exert active force on the scene. Elias offers immediate validation rather than resistance, resulting in a conflict that is resolved through mutual affirmation rather than a high-stakes choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist observes and receives wisdom rather than being forced into difficult choices under duress. The "cost" of deleting a chapter she already disliked feels negligible, dampening the stakes. The escalation is informational rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes are high in theory (dying magic) but low in practice, as the ritual faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The resolution feels inevitable from the start, missing the escalation or tightening of options that drives tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.3)
    Tension is minimal because the protagonist faces no active opposition; the ritual proceeds without error or adaptation. The stakes (previous failures) remain in the backstory, leading to a flat escalation curve where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story lacks immediate pressure; the &quot;wounded season&quot; serves as background context, and the stakes of losing &quot;wonder&quot; remain abstract. The resolution comes through steady application of skill over a time-jump, devoid of a forced trade-off, risk, or escalation that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation is functional: the burdens increase in difficulty, leading to the personal stake of the locket. While the physical struggle with the obsidian is resolved somewhat mechanically (remember quote -> adjust lamp -> success), the emotional cost of the final renunciation lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.6)
    External pressure is low; the wood "resists then yields" without forcing a difficult trade-off or significant tactical shift. The conflict is entirely internal and resolved through a linear process of execution, lacking a moment where the protagonist must pay a visible price or make a hard choice to succeed. The resolution feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are clear, but the opposition folds too easily; the ghost explains the solution ("let go") and Veyra immediately complies, reducing the dramatic tension. The conflict lacks a moment where Veyra must actively choose against her own resistance, as the antagonist essentially talks her into the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or resource scarcity that forces a hard choice. The stakes are purely abstract ("hope," "lost truths") and are resolved without sacrifice; the "equation" works immediately upon the first try, stripping the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The external tension (the bear) dissolves almost immediately into wonder, removing the sense of physical risk too quickly. While the internal thematic conflict is resolved, the lack of a harder trade-off or higher friction makes the victory feel somewhat low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no effective opposition; the captain's warning is a cliché barrier that Elias bypasses effortlessly. The narrative lacks escalation or tightening; Elias moves from the boat to the warehouse with total freedom, facing no obstacles, trade-offs, or rising costs to his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; there is little immediate pressure or cost on the page. The central conflict (decoding the rope) is resolved instantly by the tool, and the final confrontation involves no competing desires or risks, merely a request for information.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no antagonist, no environmental obstacle, and no internal reluctance. The "ghost" appears immediately upon request and provides exactly the information needed to resolve the scene, creating a flat narrative arc without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is a low-pressure process scene with no active antagonist or forcing constraint; success feels inevitable. The "bitterly sweet" stakes are declared in narration but not dramatized through actual loss or sacrifice during the hatching process.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes remain low; the confrontation with the man is defused instantly with a single line, avoiding genuine interpersonal pressure. The bird’s immediate recovery removes the cost of the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; success feels inevitable as Lira faces no active antagonism or time crunch. The gathering of items lacks friction or trade-offs, and the "scraped raw" fingers are a cosmetic detail rather than a narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stakes remain largely abstract and thematic; there is little immediate physical or relational risk to Lumin in the scene. The conflict is resolved through a gentle conversation where the protagonist accepts a new definition of fire, lacking a visible cost or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict faces minimal resistance; the spectral mentor provides the answers directly, removing the need for Marlow to struggle or pay a visible cost for his transformation. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes (the Hush) are high and clear, the escalation is linear and the resolution lacks a significant trade-off or sacrifice. The stated costs ("hands raw," "searing reverie") are descriptive rather than felt consequences of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no stakes; the chess clock runs down before the action begins, removing potential time pressure. Elara faces no antagonist, no physical danger, and no risk of failure, turning the story into a passive procedural of observation.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.0)
    Opposition is reduced to cardboard strawmen (sneering Elders, a spitting blacksmith) who offer no genuine threat to Lira's agency. The stakes are high in theory (survival) but low in practice, as Lira never doubts her success and pays no meaningful price for it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the primary opposition is static interference, which clears quickly. There is no meaningful escalation or risk of failure; Lira succeeds in her goal without needing to sacrifice anything or change her approach. The stakes are high in concept (saving stories) but low in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes remain abstract ("chasing ghosts") and are never tested by genuine opposition; Elias offers only mild philosophical commentary. There is no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options; the protagonist achieves her goal exactly as intended without forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict is clear and stakes are personal (validation vs. survival). The escalation through the physical act of digging works well to externalize the internal debate. The cost is legible in Elias's bleeding hands and social alienation, though the verbal sparring carries more weight than the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical; the "risk" of playing is mentioned but never manifests as an on-page threat or obstacle. The conflict resolves too easily through immediate musical harmony, bypassing the "rusted" barriers and the outside danger without paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; while the plant resists initially, Elara overcomes it through persistence without needing to change tactics or sacrifice anything of value. The conflict is resolved too neatly, with the "bad" memories simply pruned away to leave the "good," lacking the friction of a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, only a passive lack of "wonder." The solution is handed to her by a mentor figure, and the climax lacks a moment of risk or sacrifice, resolving the global stakes too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretical and low; there is no penalty for failure and no opposing force, resulting in a flat pressure curve. The escalation is merely procedural (placing objects) rather than a rising tide of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is very little genuine resistance; the statue immediately offers help, points out the structural weakness, and the pedestal breaks with a simple grope. The "blight" is a high-level stake that is resolved instantly by the magical drink without requiring a difficult trade-off or tactical struggle from Mara. The protagonist is passive, carried along by the statue’s guidance rather than driving the action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined as emotional survival, escalating coherently through the physical test of the proofs to the rupture. The pressure builds well, and the "hum in the bones" provides a satisfying release that alters the protagonist's tactical approach to his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are established but resolved too easily by the neighbor's convenient arrival. There is no visible cost paid for the resolution; the protagonist gains validation and connection without sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no active resistance from the community or environment. The conflict dissolves instantly when the children ask "Teach us," bypassing the necessary struggle or resistance required to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative provides a clear escalation when the first attempt fails, forcing Elias to improvise with the mercury and coil. The stakes of the stone's "hunger" add necessary pressure, though the personal cost is more implied than viscera-level.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.7)
    Tension is diffused by the advisor's immediate provision of the answer; the protagonist faces a physical threat but no dilemma of choice. The stakes are abstract ("trick fear") and the cost of success is minimal (a seared hand), lacking a deep sense of sacrifice or trade-off. The escalation is linear and lacks a meaningful reversal driven by the protagonist's ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (survival of the orchard), and pressure escalates through the environment and the "restless" euphony. The "seabird screech" offers a moment of adaptation, but the resolution feels slightly inevitable; the protagonist faces external resistance but no significant internal doubt or cost beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the abstract threat of famine to the immediate, visceral danger of the city waking up. Lira's agency directly precipitates the climax, creating a solid Causal loop, though the leap from investigation to apocalypse is abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; there is no antagonist or active resistance to Elara's goal. The investigation proceeds smoothly from clue to exposition without forcing a difficult trade-off or imposing a felt cost. The "noble lie" concept is debated but never dramatized as a threat to the protagonist's safety or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low because the physical constraints (drawbridge) are bypassed by the character's actions (wading) without explanation. The conflict is purely internal and resolved by a convenient discovery rather than an escalation of pressure or a forced tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is stated but not felt; the "groan" of failing infrastructure implies immediate structural collapse, yet Lira takes her time sketching and reading. The pacing contradicts the declared urgency of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are established as high (survival/erasure), but the climax evaporates the pressure via a speech act ("I am not afraid") rather than a costly action. The resolution feels unearned given the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate appropriately; the choice to ignore the safety warnings demonstrates agency and risk. The cost—the destruction of the observatory—is a tangible price paid for the protagonist’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the pilgrim is an immediate ally who facilitates the solution without friction. The narrative follows a linear path of unobstructed success, lacking the tightening of options or meaningful cost required for tension.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict (truth vs. fabrication) is legible, and the stakes are personal to Elias's conscience. However, the external pressure is low; the antagonist is a memory, and the solution is found too easily on the beach without active opposition, reducing the tension of the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The external stakes (the prisoner exchange) are high in theory but face no on-page obstacles, resulting in a frictionless climax. The conflict is entirely internal/thematic, but because the internal struggle is resolved through philosophical dialogue rather than a pressured choice, the tension feels low.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes remain largely internal, with the physical journey presenting little opposition; the ocean is calm and the lighthouse accessible. The conflict relies heavily on memory and abstract "regret" rather than immediate, escalating pressure in the scene. The cost paid (the compass) is symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scene lacks immediate, pressurized conflict; the encounter with J.T. reads more as a guided exposition than a clash of opposing forces. The resolution—J.T. explaining the meaning of empathy and Mara accepting it—dissolves tension through dialogue rather than dramatic action or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are declared (loss of self) but the pressure dissipates early; the antagonist is internal fear, which vanishes the moment the ritual starts ("She did not fight it"). The lack of a moment where failure seems possible flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure builds effectively through the card reading and the widening crack. However, the climax dissolves the tension rather than tightening it; the mother's appearance instantly resolves the conflict, removing the struggle necessary for a high-stakes payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is largely verbal, driven by the AI's prompts rather than rising external pressure or compounding errors. The physical manifestation of the shadows offers no resistance, dissolving instantly, which robs the climax of genuine cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are theoretical; there is no opposition or palpable cost to Lira’s choices on the page. The encounter lacks friction—the stranger is a helpful guide who removes the burden of agency, and the "messy, violent" nature of change is described in dialogue but not experienced in the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is low; the declared stakes (revolution, Council) remain abstract and off-page. The immediate obstacle (the sundial lock) offers no resistance, resolving on the first attempt without forcing a trade-off or escalation of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are legible, but the "storm of star dust" remains an abstract consequence rather than a visceral, immediate threat. The conflict resolution is relatively smooth, lacking a moment where Lira is forced to sacrifice something tangible to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are abstract (censorship vs. art) and the immediate pressure (the storm) provides atmosphere rather than forcing a difficult choice. The decision to write uncensored work happens in a safe haven with no immediate on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are purely philosophical; while physical danger is mentioned (a graze), the text explicitly undercuts the tension by stating the duel is "about translation," not victory. The transition from combat to collaboration meets no resistance, rendering the conflict static and low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (identity vs. chaos) is established, but the pressure remains low and internal. The climax resolves via a realization triggered by magic rather than a difficult trade-off or confrontation with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative lacks meaningful escalation; the pressure vanishes when the protagonist finds a sanctuary, offering wish fulfillment rather than conflict. There is no visible or felt cost paid for the resolution, lowering the stakes significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    While global stakes are high (amnesia), the on-page obstacles are low; the "perilous" dreams manifest as a helpful conversation with an ancestor rather than a genuine threat. The climax lacks a sense of active resistance or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonists face no significant opposition, failure, or trade-offs during the ritual or the voyage. The stakes remain theoretical until the end, where the resolution is achieved through a simple exchange of dialogue with no visible sacrifice.

    Dominant stake (prove kindness remembered) signaled early via cataloged fossils, deepens accumulatively to Voss's confirmation, narrowing isolation with relational cost. Agency in inviting "Teach me" forecloses solo doubt. Minor abstractness in stakes before Voss mutes visceral peak slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reassemble chip for frequency) signaled early, tightens via pilgrim's "alignment" reveal forcing star-dependent lever pull with hesitation risk. Agency in pull forecloses mechanical search; cost legible in success yielding "more questions." Escalation causal under lens, but pilgrim guidance softens pure protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (discover brother's truth to quell Lila) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via heart carving reversal narrowing options to truth-telling; agency in sifting yields visible cost (betrayal risk) charging ending under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (save ship via shadow work) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through projected memories narrowing pacifist stance. Agency in "She pressed her palm... began to stitch" forecloses avoidance with fear/joy cost. Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (restore patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fracturing visions/rock trials forcing endurance; agency in Möbius reorder forecloses control path with terror cost, but stakes slightly abstract pre-final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (rarefy poetry vs censorship) tightens via envelope's mirror-poem deepening knowledge, forcing raw writing agency; storm cadence shift narrows options with felt exposure cost in sealing for "publisher who dared."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)

Cost legible in eye-shift quake and foregone panic. One tightening sufficient under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake to escape choice-chaos tightens accumulatively via reel discovery narrowing to hidden refuge; agency in prying bench forecloses planned life with on-page cost of aching fingers and open piano left vibrating.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can her reductionist lens survive the greenhouse’s entropic mess—tightens when butterfly dust refuses modeling, foreclosing tidy equations. Cost is legible: she forfeits institutional esteem, accepting local symposium chuckles. Escalation is accumulative (dust density, mold days) not causal-turn based, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find purpose after near-death—tightens when frost-reading forces a vocational pivot; pressure grows via each deciphered vein. No external antagonist, but internal void and environmental constriction supply coherent situational pressure. Escalation peaks at shard-hologram reveal; cost is surrender of lucrative glassware for ephemeral frost panels. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; luck complicates (finding shard) yet does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove silence can sing—tightens when Elias’s silent gaze pressures her to hazard the first audible fork, narrowing options: succeed or remain invisible. Escalation is accumulative: each heat-map trial increases emotional density until the mother-lullaby memory aligns frequencies, forcing the public reveal. Cost is visible: she trades voice for vibration, a price legible in the wordless laugh. No coincidence; all pressure emerges from her iterative experiments and Elias’s steady presence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—community survival via intergenerational trust—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: anonymity dissolves when Mira rings the bell, foreclosing the safe option. Cost is legible—fear of exposure, yet exposure chosen. Agency sits with Mira; the donations cease because she forces the shift, not because sanctions ease.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no external obstacle or forked choice raises concrete cost. Tightening occurs when breath-method reveals the ember-trail, yet this is discovery, not foreclosure of options. Price is emotional peace, not a forfeiture that alters later tactics. Escalation is an accumulative brightening, adequate for lyric mode but thin under causal scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—resilience vs. scavengers—tightens once: turning the star-key forfeits secrecy and invites pursuit. The vine burst externalizes the price, but escalation is single-stage; no secondary tightening beat. Agency is decisive under causal lens, yet scavenger pressure is asserted more than tested, keeping tension below 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens once: the root’s severing spikes the frequency into an audible scream. Cost is felt (she clutches ears), but the price is momentary pain rather than a foreclosed path; she exits exultant. Escalation is single-step, sufficient for this length, yet the lack of a lived consequence after the implant weakens the tightening under the Accumulative lens. Still, the pattern break (root → molten sound) is legible and agent-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—steal the jar of truths—tightens once: the jar demands an equal offering, forcing her to ante her own memory. Escalation is one visible price (the wilted lily and surrendered photo) that reconfigures her ethos under Accumulative/Textural lens; no false reversals or coincidental rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—protect fragile inquiry—surfaces early and tightens once when the schematic compartment opens, foreclosing the option of “no usable legacy.” Pressure grows via melt-drip cadence and revealed blueprints, coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: he abandons certainty, carries the cracked bookmark as permanent reminder. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the lack of external antagonist keeps it below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—possession of shell/exposure of betrayal—signaled in first 100 words. Mid-story tightening occurs when decryption forces Lila to speak the notes aloud, narrowing her options to confrontation. Cost is visible: enforcer’s gun, mother’s exile, Lila’s forfeiture of immediate reunion. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mara render the unrenderable silence before the last star dies? Pressure escalates by accretion—each silence-layer narrows temporal margin, not physical space. No external antagonist is needed; the paper’s resistance and the star’s clock supply coherent friction. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades the living night for an artifact that replaces it, foreclosing ordinary oracle work.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—origin of thoughts—stays abstract; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Looped encounters with other units deepen texture but do not narrow options or exact a visible price. Closure relies on conceptual reweighting, acceptable under accumulative lens, yet pressure never becomes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to accept silence as valid communication—tightens through each decoded ticket; options narrow from recording everything to recording nothing. The midpoint deepening (crystals begin to warm under fingertips) makes the cost visceral: continued transcription would betray the living vibration. Final escalation is quiet but decisive: the blank “Begin” ticket forces him either to perpetuate the old system or relinquish it; he chooses forfeiture of professional duty. Stakes stay personal and legible; no abstract world-saving inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove gardens remember gardeners—tightens when Elara blocks the sensor with a vine, forcing the maze to re-route; this is the single meaningful escalation under a Causal lens. Cost is visible: she risks algorithmic failure (hence isolation) yet succeeds. No reversals needed; one decisive act narrows options and reweights the stake. Joren’s conversion is consequence, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single stake—prove time bends—tightens when the flora stir and the field buckles, forcing Veyra to wager the entire experiment on a manual recalibration. Price is visible: creatures thrash, glass rattles, her sweat slicks the visor. Escalation is linear, not deep, but the because/therefore torque keeps pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove the ghost exists by decoding the score—signals early and tightens when each water-gush risks obliterating the symbols. Agency stays personal: she kneels, dunks, memorizes; luck (pipe burst) complicates but does not save. One visible price: the program is lost to sodden fragments, leaving her with only memory—an on-page forfeiture. Escalation is linear, not reversed; sufficient for length, but a second tightening would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—own the swallowed truth or stay complicit—arrives late (~word 400) and escalation is mostly atmospheric (aurora, wind) rather than an on-page tightening that forecloses a live option; the director never confronts her after the raid, so the “rage” is off-stage rumor. One visible cost exists: she forfeits station shelter, but the choice is internally narrated rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“weight of swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens when hologram reveals cover-up, narrowing Elias’s options from thrill-seeking to moral burden. Escalation is single, meaningful deepening rather than reversal cascade; cost is conceptual (complicity knowledge) rather than visceral, but legible. Machine-voice and shaft reveal complicate via agency (he turns valve) so coincidence doesn’t resolve. A sharper visible price (physical souvenir, recorded proof lost) could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—need for judgment-free silence—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external force or ticking clock concretely threaten failure. Pressure mounts only through imagery density, not through narrowing options or visible price. Agency is largely discovery-walking; the one decisive act (dipping hand) is symbolic rather than tactical. Escalation is therefore atmospheric, acceptable under Accumulative lens but short of the visible cost required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is wonder vs. cynicism; pressure is conversational, never life-or-death. One tightening beat occurs when Mara closes her eyes and the curl glows, testing her skepticism. Agency is mostly Elara’s; Mara’s about-face feels quick, though cost is low—no forfeited belief or social risk visible. Escalation is verbal, then imagistic, adequate for lyrical mode but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover or lose humanity’s last stories—surfaces early and tightens when partial burning threatens total erasure; each new fragment narrows the possibility of complete restoration. The micro-turn: recognition that the axis is attention, not physics, immediately forecloses the option of passive study and forces vocal acknowledgment. Cost is felt conceptually rather than physically, sufficient at this length, though a tangible forfeiture (sacrificing the tapestry? his own hearing?) could have sharpened the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Elara will keep ghost-writing fate or author her own—arrives early but stays intellectual until the typed fortune; pressure is expositional (letters) rather than obstacle-based. She loses no tool, relationship, or safety; the visible price is postponed off-page. The single tightening occurs when she learns her harmless fortunes already altered governments; knowledge escalation is strong, but agency escalation is muted—she continues exactly the method she inherited. Closure bears conceptual cost, satisfying minimum felt-price bar; yet because no live option is foreclosed within scene, beat-level stakes remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—prevent dimensional erasure by exposing hidden assumptions—tightens with each loop layer; options narrow as the anchor’s hum warps into a whine, then implodes. Escalation is causal under sonic sabotage; priest pays no physical price, but the conceptual cost is legible: perpetual flux replaces controlled stillness. A sharper visceral forfeiture (fatigue, bleeding ears) would have pushed higher, yet the persistent constraint of “no going back” is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrect the past via unheard symphony—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: dawn’s advance → exhaustion threat → she writes faster, foreclosing rest. Cost is visible: “she had to work before exhaustion hit.” Agency is accumulative—each fortune written increases density of past-present collision; no coincidence resolves. Missing higher band because the escalation is single-cadence (time only) rather than a second, deeper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will she ever land and belong?”—is signaled early and sharpened by each portal’s either-or fork. Escalation is accumulative: every new timeline samples a higher cost of isolation or ordinariness, tightening the noose around neutrality. Final refusal to keep floating crystallizes stance and forecloses omniscient drift. Cost is felt but could be more viscerally acute; still, agency remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph three; tightening occurs when the filament’s first vibration pierces her chest, foreclosing the option to return to clinical silence. The cost is visceral: she forfeits the needle’s audible clarity for a hush that aches “not with emptiness but with the weight of feeling,” a trade-off that narrows future choices to tactile music only.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. official silence—tightens when the recorder screams “Critical” and the woman demands dissemination. One meaningful escalation: the lateral climb physically narrows escape routes and signals intent. Cost is visible—he forfeits anonymity by taking the vial—but the beat ends before we see consequence touch him, so pressure plateaus at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—uncover why smells wound—signals early. Escalation is textural: each scent layer deepens emotional density until the lavender-floral memory wave forces the stance shift. Agency is present—she uncorks and inhales—but the UV method is externally supplied luck, not a tactic shaped by prior pressure, capping high-band entry. Cost is felt (tears) yet doesn’t foreclose a live option; she leaves freer, not cornered. One meaningful tightening suffices for length; coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he confront the texture of his own avoided choices?—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each knot loosened raises emotional density and narrows future evasion. Visible price: the rope’s lost integrity = metaphor for life threads he can no longer leave half-tied; final spiral forces acknowledgment. Agency is continuous; no external coincidence resolves tension. Keeps inside 8.8 because the tightening is singular rather than compound, but the felt cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming chronic hush into communal possibility—is signaled early and tightens when the first note sinks into the bowl, narrowing options: she must finish the ritual or entrench the wall. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is acoustic–social. Escalation is textural: each phrase swells, crowd falls silent, bowl glows. Cost is felt—her music is no longer a private unbinding—but price could be sharper (e.g., physical tremor or broken string).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to maintain empathic distance while trafficking feelings—tightens when Lira asks to forget. One meaningful deepening: the blotter-petal test moment forces him to inhale a dose of someone else’s sorrow, risking internal contamination. Visible price: he shelves the petal, acknowledging accumulated emotional debt. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, sufficient under lens; could edge higher if static charge visibly spiked or dipped to signal irreversible拐点.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Clara’s reclaiming of her own compassion—tightens only once, when she forges the conductor’s letter; because her business never actually loses a client or dollar, the felt price is oblique rather than visible, keeping escalation just below the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—combat loneliness by finding Veyra—is signaled early and tightens once: the tag-date forces a timed choice. Agency is present but light: Kael deciphers and follows; the final reveal is Lira’s decision to unmask. Cost is the shared ache, legible but not viscerally paid on the page. Escalation is accumulative—each tag adds density rather than narrowing options—sufficient for sub-800-word scope, yet the lack of a fork where Kael risks something tangible keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find where echoes are born”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the split canal forecloses passive observation. Pendant twist is the single meaningful turn that narrows options to “enter tunnel or retreat.” Conceptual cost (she now carries unverifiable knowledge) is legible but not viscerally felt on-page. Escalation is adequate for 700-word scope, not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the ambiguous loss—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the moment sap enters cracks and eyes vibrate, foreclosing further searching; cost is the tear-mixed sap on her cheek. Agency is attention and alignment, not external battle; coincidence complicates nothing. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; density increases until constellation re-map lands.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“message that could change everything for hidden patrons”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when tape voice confirms cache existence, forcing Mara from secrecy to dissemination. Cost (exposure) is declared but not dramatized; no live obstacle or forfeiture appears, so escalation stays moderate under Causal lens. One meaningful tightening qualifies but lacks visceral price on page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Eleanor’s need for control versus nature’s refusal to be controlled—tightens exactly once when the hellebore insists on its own dissolution. The narrowing is legible: she either intervenes or relinquishes expertise; the cost is her identity as controller. No reversals beyond that single beat, but at this length one meaningful escalation suffices. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; coincidence (spontaneous vines) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve predictable harmony”—is stated early; escalation is purely textural: cadence warps → crystals shatter. No trade-off or irreversible fork is forced on Elara; the destruction happens to her, not because of a decision she makes. The ending merely burdens her perception with “unpredictable hum,” cost is present but passive. Agency gap prevents 8+ entry, but the tonal pressure does intensify under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“compile fragments into meaning”—escalates as each interval widens the pool of living testimony, raising social stakes of who owns memory. No external antagonist; pressure is situational: the harbor’s silence versus the risk of breaking it. One meaningful tightening: the girl’s locket reveal forces Lirael to relinquish sole curatorship, trading private archive for public resurrection of sound. Cost is visible—she hands over the valve; this forfeiture narrows her future solitude and cements communal reclamation of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—access to “fortress of unspoken truths”—is signaled early and tightens when the blank ticket offers only one word: Begin. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each arrow narrows the route until the final choice forecloses the safety of his ledger. Agency is present; Elias actively inserts the punch and accepts the ticket. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the map’s overwrite is visible, but we do not feel his body pay.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—intellectual integrity versus hunger for wonder—is declared early; pressure escalates once when memory incursion forces Clara to keep writing or break the spell. Cost is present (cramped hand, warmed tower air, softened skepticism) yet remains low-impact; no option is permanently foreclosed. Sufficient for length, but not scalp-prickling.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—escape eternal boredom—signalled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates under causal lens: storm weakens anchor → fragment glows → Lira offers dyadic release → refusal costs self-replication in mirror. One meaningful tightening: the mirrored hollow-Kael forecloses staying. Cost is visible—void fall with “symphony of possibilities” replacing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“keep the math from them and stay alive”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when guns level. The ink taste beat turns the conflict: she gains leverage, foreclosing the agents’ seizure option. Price is on-page: surrendering the scroll she once guarded with her life. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word frame; agents’ capitulation is abrupt, clipping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest new textures before the town’s silence widens—is declared early but remains abstract; no ticking clock, rival collector, or failing lamp threatens failure. Escalation is textural: each dawn deepens the patchwork notepad and synchronizes breath with hum, intensifying imaginative access rather than narrowing real options. The sole reversal is internal—she moves from writing to “furious” writing—yet costs zero pages, zero resources, so pressure feels luminous rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover erased identity—signals early via death certificate. Escalation is textural: each fragment layers density until locket photo forces a conceptual reweighting; cost is the loss of the protective anonymity Kael enjoyed. No visible trade-off of tools or stamina, so lacks the 8.5+ price gate, but the epistemic narrowing is clean under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redeem the astronomer’s “madness” or confirm her own rationality—tightens when the first bow-stroke makes walls shift; option space narrows to “feel or fail.” Escalation is textural: each vibration adds density until glass rattles, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is visible—she forfeits explanatory certainty, packs the fragile cello as emblem of unprovable harmony. No coincidence; resonance escalates under her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—carnival autonomy vs privatization—signaled in opening paragraph and tightened when Council barge arrives. Lira’s agency: decoding graffiti → orchestrating visual campaign → public confrontation; each action forecloses fallback to quiet negotiation. Cost is communal (risk of losing home), felt through vendor murmur and torch flare, though personal price (job loss, exile) stays off-page, capping tension just below visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“to photograph the last hush”—is signaled early and tightens once: drones en route at 17 min, dissolving grain at dawn. Escalation is situational pressure, not causal reversal; no option is foreclosed by her agency, only by sunrise and drone schedule. Cost is conceptual (archive obscurity) rather than visceral or tactical. One meaningful deepening suffices for length, but the absence of a protagonistic trade-off caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ensure flawless drone guidance before dawn lift—tightens once: HB-7 fracture forces recalibrate-or-fail decision. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each basin shimmer deepens pattern until clean refraction signals success. Cost visible: she forfeits witnessing the ship vanish, stays with next broken drone. No coincidence; success earned by tactile scrutiny and solder smoke.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rivers’ secret origin—tightens from intellectual curiosity to existential overturn. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes the source is light, not water, narrows her future cartography to spiral symbols. Cost is conceptual but undeniable on-page, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore shared balance via sonic resurrection—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each fork-strike that adds footsteps. Agency is accumulative: Kael’s micro-adjustments (angle of fork, days of sleeping in tower) gradually foreclose the option of living in the town he awakens. Cost is visible: his satchel dwindles, body stiffens, and finally he forfeits place. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational—silence itself resists. One credible loss: the town’s first bell-sound is “imperfect, harsh,” proving revival is not utopian.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the memories before storm breach—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the vial warms and the hush “clings to her skin,” foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she uncorks the vial, choosing to absorb the grief rather than flee. Cost is visceral—voices pierce suit and bones—and persists: she surfaces with empty lungs and emptied vial. One minor loop: “time ran short” is repeated without new gradient, keeping this just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: replace father’s lies with lived truth before corpses surface. Pressure tightens when lattice blooms and twin demands story completion; Elias’s choice to plant lattice beside father’s rusted one visibly forecloses denial. Cost—ownership of inevitable corpse discovery—made legible in final reef gaze. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—the bead’s imprisoned soul versus the ghost’s centuries-old vow—signals early and tightens once when the bead meets the largest fruit, forcing knowledge change on Elara. Price is conceptual: centuries of stasis crack into dawn, visible on-page. No second reversal is needed; escalation satisfies the Accumulative/Textural lens by deepening pattern density rather than because/therefore turns. Ghost remains largely passive oracle; agency resides with Elara, but the story never dramatizes her fear or hesitation, muting visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore sacredness—tightens when murals revive under her touch, but escalation is tonal (brightness returns) rather than a narrowing of options; the price (drained plates) is present yet not dramatized as a trade-off that threatens failure, so pressure climbs lyrically, not causally.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore faith via shrine—signalled early; tightening occurs when roots react to sundial, turning abstract hope into physical resonance villagers can witness. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she alone positions relic, speaks to trees, kneels in light. Cost is communal and symbolic rather than personal body-risk, but legible on page. One meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will she decode the family signal before the carrier arrives?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the chalk margin under the wax seal forces a now-or-never dip. Cost is visible (tears blur vision, anonymity foregone) but not physically taxing; still, the conceptual price of stepping from shadow to mentor is legible. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient for 750-word scope. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is decorative, not resolving.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: data vs. tactile memory, how marginal marks become inheritance. Chalk codes and surface mail reframe nostalgia as active resistance rather than sentiment. Final image—“clipboard humming, ready to juxtapose again”—offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights the arcade from bazaar to archive. No moral is stated; the thematic answer is the gesture itself. Complexity is honored—no tidy redemption of the city’s collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve hidden star-knowledge—faces immediate tightening when council repositions telescopes; Zara’s agency is the deliberate act of decoding/displaying the chart to Jaxon, foreclosing her “invisible” status. Felt price: once the chart morphs in firelight, her disguise is weaponized and irreversible. Escalation is single but sufficient; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when the fresco fragment threatens to expose elegy as habit. Agency: Lira decides to “challenge the fog’s monopoly,” narrowing her future (no more quiet memorials). Cost is visible but soft: the fog thins, committing her to defend fragile carnival light tomorrow. A sharper material price—broken prism, cut hand—would push this into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“coax the mural’s memory without destroying it”—tightens when cracks widen and 1920s dancers threaten permanent fade. Escalation is textural: each harmonic bounce increases visual and audible density until the flapper’s wink re-prices Marisol’s heritage. Cost is the irreversible resealing: she gains lineage proof but loses repeatable access. Agency sits squarely in her dish-tilt decision; coincidence only complicates. Could use one more intermediate tactical loss (spilled pigment, brief dish slip) to punch the price earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can Elias earn trust and amplify resistance—tightens through the pheromone test and the seed’s public deployment. The escalation is coherent but gentle: failure risk is implied (club rejection, civic surveillance) yet never made visceral; the orchid swarm carries no jeopardy beyond symbolic_pass/fail. The final garden glow is a beautiful widening, not a narrowing, of options. Cost is conceptual (exposure) rather than tangible, sufficient for this length but not gut-level.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve dormancy vs allow evolution”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the irreparable crack forces a creative breach. One meaningful deepening: the refusal to accept loss shifts from passive caretaking to active song-weaving, visible price paid as extinct feelings escape. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the break. The cost (equilibrium shattered, director’s flicker of approval) is on-page and scaled to micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore trust before Mira’s wedding”—is signaled early and tightens through each archival breadcrumb; the manuscript of two sisters acts as the final pressure crucible. Escalation is Accumulative: each discovered promise thickens thematic density until silence becomes unbearable. Cost is visible—cramped body, spent ink, dawn exhaustion—but not persistent; no tactical alteration after the key is handed over, keeping the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decrypt the envelope before the volcano breathes its last—tightens once when the rumble quickens, forcing her final measurement. Cost is visible: she risks misreading and thus mis-mending the sender’s heart. Agency sits entirely with Lira; no external savior appears. Escalation is situational, not causal, but the breathing cadence supplies coherent pressure that crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. fabricated legacy—tightens when the 1987 ledger entry proves the meteorite already traveled once, making Elias complicit in its loop. Escalation is textural: each recovered fragment (cassette, dream, dust map) increases density rather than external peril, consistent with Accumulative lens. The price is visibly felt: ignored clients, forfeited reputation, the aloneness of walking out. One tightening beat suffices and is present.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—map the sacred threshold to understand abandonment—surfaces early and tightens once: the corn path appears, foreclosing endless wandering. Cost is conceptual (codes rewritten, terrace lost) rather than visceral; she pays no new physical price, blunting escalation. Agency is present—she descends, writes, steps through—but the maze offers no resistance after revelation, letting pressure plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—proving underwater skies exist—stays internal and observational; no live option is foreclosed. Alignment deepens texture but does not test Mara’s ingenuity or risk failure. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Cost is diffuse wonder, not a priced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens once when Lira forces seeds into the shard and watches the regret clear; this narrows her options from “find” to “release.” Cost is legible: the pool’s images show the bird turning away, fog consuming the path. No coincidence; pressure accrues under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—prove chaos can be art—tightens when the discordant note drops the spoon and the fountain flares, forcing collective movement. Agency is performative attention: Lira never risks bodily or social loss; the price is paid by the arcade’s stasis, not her. The escalation is single yet decisive, satisfying the length, but the lack of a personal trade-off keeps it shy of 8.8+. Coincidence is ruled out: the flare is cued by her note, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—personal renewal versus ban-reinforced erasure—tightens the moment the dust adheres and the stylus burns; no abstract cosmic threat required. Escalation is textural: each dance coil increases density until the garden itself trembles and options narrow to one illegal inscription. Cost is visibly paid in searing flesh and the irreversible exile announced in the last paragraph. Agency is hers: she steals, dances, writes—no external savior.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is declared early but never challenged; no obstacle or alternative vision competes with her goal. Pressure is ambient, not escalating: the boat appears after the revelation, posing no threat or trade-off. The stone toss deepens texture rather than narrowing options; no reversal or cost alters her course. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification (ripples → rainbow bloom) is beautiful but not consequential; the closing peace feels pre-paid.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will he release self-blame?—is signaled early and tightened once when sand moves; no option is foreclosed, but knowledge reweights. Agency is interior and observational; cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; the cadence shift of flowing sand suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can decorative patterns literally levitate hope into reach?—is signaled early and narrowed to a single trial launch. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each dyed strand increases algae luminosity until the space itself folds, a visible intensification. Agency is present (she chooses the silver hair strand as conduit), but the external risk is abstract—no clock, no rival, no bodily peril—so the cost, while conceptually legible, lacks visceral punch. Still, one meaningful tightening occurs when the needle locks on “17,” foreclosing earlier skepticism and validating her equation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each diary line thickens the sense that the corridor feeds on memory. One tightening: burning the film surrenders her external record to become the internal map. Cost is conceptual (she absorbs the dreams), but not viscerally felt; no credible loss of tool, time, or social credit. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“persuade mirrors to show beyond”—is signaled early and escalates mirror-by-mirror, each reframing risk of failure. Agency is present yet low-conflict: no mirror resists hard enough to force a tactical shift or sacrifice. The borrowed heartbeat quickens, but Lirael never risks losing it, so the felt price is muted. Still, the final image forecloses the fantasy of reunion, tightening options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—imperfect peace vs. personal integrity—signals early. Pressure escalates by accretion: each delegate concession adds density rather than reversals. Agency is endurance/renunciation; Elara forecloses the fantasy of immaculate peace when she accepts ambiguous language. Cost is legible—coffee stain crease becomes emblem of future fragility—but no single tightening beat narrows live options; instead slow erosion suffices under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (clipboard scars) shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he manufacture meaning from engineered loss—tightens once when he pours the last river water: that act forfeits any future claim to ecological restoration, narrowing his remaining option to monetized memory. Escalation is accretive: each beat (diversion, purchase, theft, ritual, resort plan) layers guilt-as-asset until the final image retroactively reweights the map as art. Cost is visible—empty vial, dissolved egg, thunder that will never hatch. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate echoes vs. conformity lullaby—is clear by line 8. Escalation is accumulative: each dance pass brightens threads, deepening stakes until the snap. Cost is visible fatigue (breath faster, lighter exit) and implicit social risk of carrying subversive memories. No live option is foreclosed on-page, so stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can a story be ethical if it withholds—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the drifter challenges “half-truths.” The reversal act narrows options: Elias must publicly defend partial concealment or lose the crowd. Cost is visible—the audience’s nervous laughter turns cathartic, social credit spent. Pressure coheres under situational lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked deaths—remains abstract; no concrete consequence if she fails. Escalation is purely cadential (density of knots, darkening sky) rather than option-narrowing; monarch arrives unbidden, offering grace but no test of conviction. Cost is atmospheric (aching hands, impending rain) rather than tactical, keeping pressure legible but lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover Lira’s erased voice—tightens when each mis-aligned thread risks permanent silence. The rope’s shudder and aurora fracture escalate via because/therefore linkage: flawed weave → light surge → maternal apparition. Cost is legible: burned shadow, raw hands, and the irreversible re-braid that locks the memory into ice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—is signaled early and re-posed by the hologram. Pressure deepens via accumulative texture: storm → seal → dream → recognition, each layer narrowing options toward acceptance rather than escape. No external antagonist, yet internal conflict escalates from curiosity to stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she accepts responsibility for rewriting the directive—but the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she convert frugal empirical habit into covenant with unquantifiable cosmos—tightens once: tile-meld projects mentor’s star-equations, forcing either cynical retreat or leap. She leaps; price is loss of safe objectivity: “Some truths were too vast for telescopes.” Agency is continuous: every tile placement, choice to speak to the voice, final grip on biting edge are her moves. Pressure is situational but coherent; coincidence never rescues. Cost is conceptual but legible on-page: her own starred face is the map she must now live inside.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can resentment be taught to release?—is declared in paragraph one and tightened four times, each pour of blood raising the price of Lirael’s dwindling supply. Agency stays hers: she chooses the last drop, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible (physical depletion, emotional fatigue) but not yet viscerally felt by her body on the page—hence stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will they open a path to the runaway dream?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the mirrors’ ripple and sextant’s autonomous swivel foreclose retreat; the gift of the pocket mirror costs Elias a proprietary edge. Agency is shared but legible: synchronized breathing is the decisive tactic that enables passage. No reversal, yet the narrowing of options (once the path appears, refusal would break the stranger’s last hope) supplies sufficient pressure. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep the orchard alive after breach”—is signaled early and tightens when the weld must succeed or the vow fails. Agency is steady: each scavenged item (key, wire, starlight) escalates options narrowing to the single decisive weld. Price is orchard’s rebloom, itself a felt vindication; a personal material loss would have nailed 8.5+. Escalation is linear but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“forbidden knowledge versus institutional safety”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens with each shell iteration. The portrait shell deepens the cost: if she proceeds, she confronts a future self already marked by cosmic gaze. Agency remains hers: she chooses to press the blank into the tree, instantly forfeiting her museum career (a price spelled out in “the board would never believe her”). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750 words; the tightening from map to naming tree is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the garden or remain nameless”—signaled early. Tightening occurs once: lullaby key-press forces descent, foreclosing surface retreat. Cost is the ship’s erasure; felt on page (“the ship vanished behind them”). Agency is cerebral (song choice, sewing) yet alters reality; coincidence complicates (fog) but does not resolve. No secondary stake drift; pressure stays under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—“access lost knowledge”—is signaled early and tightens when the gear jams; her rope tweak is a visible, reversible act that narrows options. Cost is mild (sparks, chill) rather than lasting; escalation is single-step, acceptable for length but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single stake—restore silence—tightens via the stone’s accelerating pulse and the rising static storm. One meaningful deepening: the ice spiral’s vibration turns observation into summoning, narrowing options to “conjure or be drowned.” Cost is felt in bodily pain and translucent energy beings; no second reversal, but the escalation cleanly forces the bloom’s creation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove meaning in coincidences—tightens when each star-path alignment costs blood and stamina. The storm-night deepening forces the final shard insertion, foreclosing abandonment; price is visible in torn skin and the void’s unhealed scar.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—identity vs. archival distance—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when she conjectures that fog density warps time, forcing her to choose participation over observation. Accumulative escalation: solid fog thickens → fractures → evaporates, each stage reweighting the cost of losing versus living memory. No coincidence; pressure grows through her own measurements and listening. Cost is legible but modest—she forfeits completeness of record yet loses no tangible tool or social credit, keeping pressure high-band but sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—outrunning the gravity of her own failure—is signaled in the first 100 words and tightened by each sensory filter: every new bloom of light raises the wager that she’ll either transcend or repeat the pavilion fire. The chain-reaction ignition is agent-driven; she places the knot, triggers the lilies, and the sky’s reflected glow makes the price (memory of scarred children) shimmer inside the triumph. Cost is visible in the laugh that catches her raw throat—triumph laced with lingering scorch.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can she make Kael feel the pause’s creative potential—tightens once via the cicada rotation; coincidence absent. Cost is present but internal/relational; no visible resource lost. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length, yet the absence of a tangible forfeit keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“collect silence flavors before the hatch closes”—is signaled early and tightened when the doll (anchor of past silence) is released to keep climbing the trellis. One meaningful intensification: gravity re-righting forces an immediate choice—cling to trellis or let doll go—narrowing options under time pressure. Cost is visible: she loses the doll and returns empty-handed, paying the price for the silence she tasted. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the sprout emerges later as delayed consequence, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—learning to “teach silence how to comfort”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the vial abruptly stills, reconfiguring her knowledge. Escalation is accretive, not causal-oppositional; no external antagonist or tangible loss is risked, so cost remains atmospheric rather than visceral. The final image forecloses nothing concrete; it deepens concept, satisfying the lens but limiting band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“claim throne before sunrise”—tightens when stair flickers and collapses behind her; visible price paid (no return, throne refused). Guardian’s demand for truth, not blood, forces stance crystallization; escalation driven by her agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs breach the threshold—tightens once: Elara’s encroachment is the decisive escalation that visibly costs the sanctuary’s stability. No reversals beyond the single crossing, but that act narrows her future options under Causal lens. Cost is legible in the shudder and scent-shift. Secondary pressure (Kael’s resentment) stays verbal and does not compound tactics, keeping this just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single dominant stake—implosion/death—tightens once when diamonds tremble; Mara’s agency narrows to “turn or die.” Cost is legible in the final tactile image, yet the escalation is one-step; no secondary trade-off deepens the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible early: “uncover a hidden truth.” Pressure tightens once: the standing wave peaks, the compartment opens, and the option to restore the dynasty is foreclosed by the letters’ revelation. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but still legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tested by the string-snap. Escalation is textural: each gear-scream and vine-flare thickens ambient density until the greenhouse can no longer contain him. The price (loss of armor, erasure of program text) is legible, though the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the final reconfiguration forecloses return, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (giving the forgotten a name) are signaled early and deepen when the button contradicts the 1873 file, tightening historical erasure as pressure. Yet the escalation is intellectual, not tactical—no live option is foreclosed—so the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—“truth vs. erasure”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the terminal files copy under drone threat. One visible price: the station’s explosion deletes future access, foreclosing extraction again. Agency is active, but the escape feels slightly convenient (drones retreat off-page), nudging cost toward reported rather than witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signaled paragraph 1; tightening occurs when spectral voice frays under sax-wail, foreclosing option to hear the code completed. Cost legible in scorched breath and fading prism-glow. Agency is sustained attention/renunciation rather than single decisive act; still sufficient under accumulative lens. Could use one earlier visceral price for 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—decode leaf-message—signals early; pressure escalates via because/therefore linkages as dust enables leaf legibility. Cost is conceptual (loss of disbelief, dissolution of dust) rather than tangible resource loss; felt price is moderate. No antagonist or reversal, but single meaningful deepening suffices for length. Agency sits mostly with Elinor’s ritual act; storm warning is externally delivered, slightly blunting personal jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will the compass grant certainty?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the needle refuses north. The plunge forces a physical price (shock, dragged under) and crystallizes the stance shift: from fixer to embracer of flux. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope. Coincidence (storm uncovers hatch) complicates but does not resolve; agency still owns the laugh of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“redeem himself by proving alchemy can reach the unseen”—tightens when the coin activates the vortex, forcing a live wager: cling to logic or accept metaphysical answer. Escalation is single but sufficient; cost is the irreversible loss of the coin and of certainty about names. No secondary pressure, so ceiling is mid-high.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—capture laughter to heal ghosts—signaled in first 200 words. Single tightening when Lira admits fear and offers the tooth, trading certainty for access; this narrows her stance and forecloses retreat. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens: each harp note raises doubt, her question raises stakes, her gamble answers. Cost is the relic’s activation and the internal ache of hope—visible but not irreversible. Lacks a second hard constraint, so stops short of 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can survival be quantified into mercy?—tightens when fractals in the glow offer a false equation, then deepens when the woman’s touch collapses that option. Escalation is accumulative: each UV flare → spore burn → glow pattern increases density until “choice not equation” becomes the only remaining stance. Protagonist agency present in decision to keep walking with strap in hand, foreclosing numerical absolution. Cost visible: strap edge still breaks skin at close.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—retrieve shard or the drowned world stays forgotten—signaled at tapestry reveal. Escalation is micro but decisive: each hidden detail (wave-breath, star-scar) eliminates brute-force options, narrowing to intuition-only. Payoff is the shard slipping free *because* she accepts memory pain; luck plays no part. Cost is the cut palm and the transferred weight to the weaver—felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—ghosts need witnessing—signals early and tightens once: the ceiling reveal forecloses the option to leave without acknowledgment. Agency is observational-decisive: analyzing dust → choosing to brush, listen, open plaster, then to “repair the stories.” No external antagonist; pressure is situational-accumulative. Cost is legible in trembling legs and cold ghost touch; escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberty versus stasis—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens when the whisper shatters, foreclosing the safe equilibrium forever. Escalation is density-driven: each frost pattern → press clatter → glass crack intensifies the stake until the airborne maelstrom reweights all options. Agency sits with Elara’s micro-choices (collect dew, load plate, hold page aloft); patrons’ terror supplies visceral cost. No reversal, but the single meaningful tightening (spiral forms) is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the Luminari fraud—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the Council tears down drapes, narrowing Kael’s options to the fungi gambit. Escalation is largely reputational and symbolic; no bodily or resource cost is risked on-page, so pressure is intellectual rather than visceral. The mirror method’s payoff arrives via storm-vision, a situational gift rather than an earned reversal, muting the cost clarity. Still, the final fungi reveal forces public re-interpretation, a legible social price.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can the box be re-aligned to truth without destroying the widow—is signaled by line 3. Pressure escalates through Elias’s tactile gambles: each needle pass narrows options until confession becomes the only remaining “tool.” Cost is visible on-page: stone’s dimming star, widow’s crumpling face, the single crystalline note that fills the world—audible price paid. No coincidence; the moral mechanism demands human candor as fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reach the place where explanation fails—is signaled early and tightened when the compass vibrates and the lagoon hum forces her to drop it; this micro-turn trades control for access. Cost is legible: forfeiture of scientific certainty, sealed physically in jars. No additional reversals, but one meaningful tightening fits 600-word scope. Agency remains interior (acceptance) yet forecloses her former rational stance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—make the island’s chaos legible—signalled early and escalates through slide discovery, portal crossing, ancestral imperative. Tightening beat: “You’re late” forces crystallized stance. Price is existential absorption of layered time; felt but not visceral. Agency present at each node; no coincidences solve problems. Slightly abstract cost prevents 8.0+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the glass language before the abbey restoration ends—tightens when each light-shift reveals fainter etchings, risking permanent loss. One meaningful deepening: morning roots → noon star charts → twilight heartbeats progressively foreclose wrong readings, forcing Mara to abandon literal jasmine for negative-space shadows. Cost is visible: bruised palms, aching teeth, sleepless circuits, and public murals that now “whisper” rather than declare. Escalation is textural but legible; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“breathe life into ashes”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when each scavenged artifact becomes a thread that either works or doesn’t, narrowing options toward acceptance of the sealed bottle. Escalation is textural: density of lantern light and ghostly presence intensifies rather than causal reversals; this fits the Accumulative lens. Visible price: Elias’s solitude deepens as the town revives without him; cost is legible. No coincidence rescues; revival is earned by memory labor.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—will Voss decode the prophecy before the city’s breath runs out—arrives with the foghorn silence. Pressure accumulates through sonic density: shriek + harmonic hum = tightening. No visible price is exacted on-page; Voss’s tactics do not change, only his interpretive stance. Still, the hum matching the horn’s absence is a legible pattern break that reweights meaning under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can one tester’s listening prevent premature storm rage—tightens when the new tone stirs clouds, foreclosing the option to remain passive. Escalation is causal: bell agitates → must re-pattern → arms ache as price. No abstract stakes; every beat tests the acoustic rule-set. Cost is visible (aching arms, softened cloud edges) and reweights future listening duty.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: the courage to let go / embrace vulnerability via stellar dissolution. Pressure tightens once: the fracturing meteor → walk → crater → lantern dimming; cost is conceptual (loss of starlight, acceptance of transience) rather than tangible, sufficient for this length but not viscerally felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—preserve vs. release silence—tightens when the box’s glow forces the first audible word. Escalation is accretive: each spectral visitation thickens atmosphere rather than threatening bodily harm, but the final “Speak” undeniably forecloses the option of lifelong silence. Visible price: the box’s destruction and ghostly dispersal leave Elias acoustically naked in the wasteland. Could use one earlier moment where silence visibly costs him (missed connection, hazard), but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover the feel of passing time—signals early and tightens when the capsule’s broken mechanisms mock that quest. Agency: Elias’s cataloguing of relics is an active tactic that eventually rewrites the rules (mercury sphere = earned reconfiguration). Cost is legible: he forfeits numerical certainty and carries permanent perceptual shift. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal, but the lens-appropriate intensification holds.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stake—discover beauty in the incomplete—stays lyrical; pressure tightens only once when kite string snaps and she responds by starting the weave. No tangible price is risked or lost; the “cost” is future dissolution mentioned in closing reflection, not lived on-page. Escalation is a single cadence shift: storm fragments → woven circle. Sufficient for short lyric mode but thin for high-band entry. </question>
    <question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through material action: fragments, weave, dissolve. Final image of impermanence reweights the earlier “beauty in the incomplete” without moralizing. Subtext sits in the fisherman’s silent nod—social acknowledgment of ephemeral art. No thematic echo lines; idea stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—interspecies harmony—signals early and tightens once: the rumble forces Lira to decide whether to continue. Cost is visible: her final breath pays the price, and the orchard’s hum locks in the new state. No secondary resource loss (tools, social credit) is dramatized, so escalation feels singular rather than compounded. Agency remains ritualistic; the copper acts more than she agonizes, keeping the score south of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“expose fraud or uncover truth”—is clear; the amber test constitutes one definitive tightening that narrows options to either validation or disillusionment. Pressure is situational: Lirael must decide whether to trigger the catalyst under Kael’s skeptical gaze; her agency drives the beat. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than tangible; a sensory price (dizziness, nausea, loss of footing) would have pushed the score above 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: restore life to dead reef-land. Pressure is ambient—time, storm, barren soil—but no live option is foreclosed; he simply keeps planting. Escalation is poetic density, not causal narrowing. Visible cost (reef ash in hand) is present, but stakes never spike to a decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—is declared, yet pressure never tightens; each solved riddle adds communal warmth but no visible price or lost option. No meaningful reversal or trade-off narrows possibility; escalation is accretive, not crucible. Agency rests in Hush’s nose, but the cost is absorbed by the group, not the protagonist. The final cheer is felt, but the absence of a forfeiture keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent spire collapse—surfaces early and tightens once: the violet sky darkens to black, forcing faster swaps. Escalation is single-step, not iterative; no resource lost or option foreclosed on-page. Agency is present but frictionless—every replacement succeeds without adaptation. Cost is external (city saved) rather than internal or tactile, so pressure remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—document invisible gestures—faces one tightening beat: king topples only after she reverses her pattern, proving agency. Cost is present (she claims the board, exits the liminal), but external stakes (curators’ return) stay abstract; price is more existential than visceral. Sufficient for length, but not gut-punch.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: erased pawns = erased everyday actors; final image reframes Elara as both pawn and historian, no moralizing. “Luminous absence” reweights earlier silence from void to potential. One micro-lecture line—“history remembered the loud”—tilts toward statement, but is embedded in walk-action, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the shape of home”—tightens when the stone forces her either to keep fleeing or to accept others’ memories inside her skin. Escalation is one-step but sufficient: feather-touch widens from translation attempt to irreversible graft of shards. Agency is present; she could drop the feather at any point but chooses to press harder. Cost is visible: obsidian embedded in mercury skin ends any fantasy of leaving the mountain unmarked.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled in paragraph one. Escalation arrives via the single micro-turn: black thread yanked → memory surge → labyrinth path revealed, tightening options under causal logic. Cost is visible: the tapestry border irreversibly unravels, foreclosing the fantasy that guilt can stay contained. Pressure plateaus rather than deepens further, keeping this below the 8.8 tier that would require a second, higher price.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—refract truth before ritual seals it—tightens once when the word “Forgive” is painted, narrowing options: exposure or silence. Escalation is linear but coherent: chant → tremor → light burst; the villagers’ rapt silence is the visible price that forecloses the elders’ monopoly. No reversal, yet the single deepening suffices at this length. Agency stays with Kael; coincidence only amplifies, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens once: the charm’s map reweights her cracked past, foreclosing denial. Pressure escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer (acid, hum, constellation) deepens the cost of narration. Final respirator removal is an earned stance with visible bodily price. No coincidence; escalation is internally generated.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can he convert private nostalgia into live artistic risk—is signaled early via the cracked mirror and intensifies through tactile cave encounters. The warm pool reflection presents a single deepening that reframes past/present polarity; the cost is the surrender of his former documentary stance, shown by leaving the sketch behind. Agency is present but mild: the fork choice lacks visible consequence, slightly blunting escalation. Still, the final image crystallizes a trade-off that narrows future options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can a whisper change anything—tightens when Thalos’s grin shifts from antagonism to mentorship, stripping Elara of her victim alibi and forcing her to own the experiment. The humming exhale is the decisive turn that risks exposure; cost is immediate (Thalos’s footsteps, potential shame) and persistent (the cork keeps glowing, proof now private). Under Accumulative lens, scent-salt-hum layers increase density until the final rain-tear solution reweights the stake: the world did listen, just not loudly. Village beat summarized keeps cost from piercing 9.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“map the geography of loss”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates from static grief to active summoning. The midnight calls and moon-tied weight shifts narrow options: she must keep building or surrender the drowned routes forever. One meaningful tightening occurs when the noon signal arrives while the moon still hangs—forcing her to trust the ritual fully. Cost is paid on-page: lost sleep, cut hair, bodily risk under shaking roof; luck complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting fragile psychological safety—announced early; pressure escalates when eye forces raw truth from Jorn, narrowing Mara’s options to either hide or weaponize the ledger. Cost is implied (exposure could destroy her market), but not paid on-page; ledger remains inert, muting climax intensity. Agency is reaction—she listens, decides to “occlude,” but we don’t see the implementation or immediate consequence, so escalation plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elias keep observing or finally bear another’s guilt?—is signaled by line 3. Pressure tightens once: the trunk opens, forcing him to decide whether to ferry the memories ashore. Cost is felt immediately; he forfeits his treasured detachment. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word length; no reversals are needed because the single turn reweights his entire raison d’être.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she exit her life or re-enter it?—is signaled early. One tightening: the doorway appears only after she touches the chip, forcing a stay-or-leave fork. Cost is her forfeiture of the portal’s infinite possibility, paid on-page: “the chip cold in her hand.” Agency drives the turn; coincidence (ants) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will she keep numbing or own her fear?—is signaled early and tightened once: the figure’s pronouncement collapses her denial. Pressure is coherent under a situational lens; coincidence (fireflies) complicates mood but does not resolve. Cost is conceptual (acknowledged wound) yet visible on the page; a second, more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the nexus’s light—signaled in first 100 words. Escalation is iterative: each failed engine raises personal and civic cost. The tightening turn comes when she cedes control to the shell, narrowing options from domination to listening. Price is legible: prior explosions, ringing ears, and the still-risky hum at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can escape the fixed narrative of his own death—tightens once: the scroll’s blank page demands he surrender authorship, foreclosing the option to keep rewriting the past. Escalation is textural: each artifact (grave, birch scroll, blank scroll) increases the density of memory until the final reconfiguration. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the accretion of selves. Cost is conceptual—the loss of narrative control—made legible in the moment the blank page writes itself.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can Lira gift Mrs. Voss absolution by decoding the screw—tightens once the engraving surfaces; her choice to intervene narrows her safe detachment and exposes her own loss. Cost is legible: she trades anonymity for emotional intimacy, measured in the audible chime that ends the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—turn scars into readable runes—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when crystallization threatens to shatter his arm. Escalation is causal: each new ink vein raises stakes until the portal rewrites his skin. Cost is visible (glowing lattice, platform shudder) yet the price stops just short of wounding him further; a hair more bodily jeopardy would push 8.8+. Still, agency is active—he carves the air itself after the first success, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can guilt be alchemized into music before the orchard dies—is signaled in Elias’s first line. One decisive tightening: the drop falls → room shudders → options narrow to “finish the song.” Price is paid on-page: bottle empties, silence ends, orchard irrevocably falls—felt cost meets 8.8 band guardrail. Coincidence (tree fell years ago) complicates rather than resolves; present agency remains Elias’s fingers and Clara’s pour.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusions”—stays abstract; nothing narrows to a concrete forfeiture until the blank dictionary moment. Pressure is atmospheric (echoing hush, shifting shelves) rather than option-closing. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized on the page; escalation is a mood deepening, not a tightening vice. The ending’s cost is conceptual, but the protagonist’s agency in arriving there is largely off-page introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—barrier survival—starts ambiguous (“afraid”) but sharpens when the column lattice literally trembles. One meaningful tightening: Kael’s frequency match fuses personal obsession with system salvation, foreclosing the option to reinforce rigid shields. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the farm gains permeability but what Kael forfeits (intellectual arrogance?) remains abstract, capping intensity at the 8-band door.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can Clara confront chaos without betting—signals early and tightens once: the fork choice physically forces her to act on her father’s lecture about unordered chaos. Cost is visible: tears mixed with rain imply emotional payment, and the left-track decision forecloses the right-track unknown. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 725-word count; coincidence (Ms. Greer’s vanishing) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to transmute anonymous loss into connection—surfaces early and tightens through caller after caller, each mis-routed plea a mini-cost paid by strangers. She herself forfeits no live option; escalation accrues in others, not her, so pressure plateaus. Visible price (disc cracks, dawn exhaustion) is present yet thin; tension is cumulative vignette stress rather than narrowing options for Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“keep the covenant alive through small acts”—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on-page; the final smile is acceptance, not escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“cure for loneliness”—is signaled early and tightened when the ghost refuses the term, insisting loneliness is language, not disease, thus foreclosing the expected payoff and forcing Elias to revise desire. One visible cost appears: the moon rock vanishes, but its loss is abstract, not tied to tactics or body. Escalation is conceptual rather than visceral; stakes pivot but do not wound, keeping pressure below 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake: reach the stillpoint where grief might transmute. Escalation is steady: each ultrasonic drop narrows the audible trail, raises stakes of permanent loss if he fails. Digging in electrified river is visible price—cold, possible drowning, map trembling. No coincidence; agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing a life-threatening blight—tightens when Lira reveals collaborative editing is the only path; options narrow from “rewrite reality” to “relinquish authorship.” Cost is visible: Elias abandons his former power and must confess. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“when no one remembers you, silence becomes a prison”—is signaled in para-1 and tightened when the fisherman asks “Play that again,” proving Kael’s silence-map has breached the town’s forgetting. The violin’s rising scale is the visible price: Lira’s bow pays out Kael’s emotional credit, foreclosing his safe invisibility. Agency stays with Kael: each faster sign accelerates communal listening, not deus-ex-moonlight. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise to keep stories alive—tightens when each act of “vandalism” actually risks erasing more history if she misreads the tapestry. The midpoint shift from theft to co-creation (painting symbols rather than stealing them) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the grandmother’s face re-forming costs Mara her anonymity and her last vial of ink.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—make the entangled memories livable—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens; each paragraph re-announces the lagoon’s beauty without raising the cost of holding it. The one meaningful turn is the woman’s invitation to drum, yet it emerges as gentle epiphany, not a forced trade-off. Agency is cooperative rather than sacrificial; no resource, belief, or future path is visibly forfeited. Escalation is atmospheric (glow deepens, plants sway) but options never narrow, keeping the conflict at a steady lyric simmer instead of a decisive squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers beat shouts”—is declared early and tested when Elias rejects shouting back at lost haulers, tightening his tactical silence. One meaningful escalation: storm-peaked midnight + spinning compasses erase map reliability, forcing instinctive coin/key pivot that forecloses the safe pencil-route. Cost is felt: double-pay bragging rights surrendered to Voss for the slower whisper-path; haulers remain lost as proof. Agency pure; no coincidence resolves. Could use one tangible loss (tool, blood) to push past “bragging” into visceral, hence capped at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled in paragraph three and pursued through the weave action. One meaningful tightening occurs when dusk fades and mirror-light becomes scarce, forcing final precise tilts; option loss is implicit but legible. Cost is the eternal return acknowledged in last paragraph. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density of patterns rather than external antagonist, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“can silence be turned into connection?”—is signaled early and tightened when Lila finally speaks aloud. Escalation is lyrical rather than plot-twist: each game lost still raises the cost of continuing (dawn arrival, emotional exposure). Agency is shared: Clara risks her safe isolation, Lila risks voice. Price is visible (hood slips, board packed at dawn), though not irreversible, keeping it just outside 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“leave or vanish with the island”—is signaled early and tightens when the whale’s call leaves only one path. Releasing the scrimshaw is the single decisive trade-off that forecloses return; cost is legible as the island fractures. No secondary reversal is needed at this length. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, capping at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will grief be erased?”—tightens through each carving step; the mandate’s threat is the off-stage pressure that makes sanding an act of defiance. No reversal, but a deepening: the bowl’s balance between emptiness and fullness mirrors her refusal to choose mandated joy. Cost is visible in the disintegrated petal and the vow to repeat the labor tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolve boundaries between sacred/profane—signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory density rather than narrowing options. The lake’s parting is spectacular but imposed by world, not triggered by a failed attempt or visible trade-off from Lirael. No credible loss (time, tool, social credit) alters tactics. Escalation reads as tableau intensification, not option foreclosure; cost legible but not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—proving beauty in imperfection—signals early; pressure tightens once via cobalt dust gamble. Cost is conceptual (Elias abandons grayscale purity) but not viscera-felt; no tool, stamina, or social credit visibly forfeited. Escalation is pattern-break rather than option-narrowing; coincidence (moth inside rose) complicates without protagonist agency. The mural bloom is spectacular yet passively received, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“feel connection”—is signaled early and deepens when the cave’s hum turns tangible. One meaningful tightening: lens pressed to carving transforms abstract quest into visceral vibration, foreclosing the need for further machines. Cost is felt as intellectual humility, visible in Voss’s awe; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“mend what others have lost to redeem failing her”—is clear but abstract; no visible price or opposition after lantern one. Escalation is textural: each new lantern thickens light, not risk. The living shadows promise a reversal, yet Elias keeps folding; tension plateaus. Missing a beat where success could cost him the last scrap of vellum or force him to stay and guard the beacon, foreclosing travel.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can cultural rubble be mapped into a new blueprint?—is signaled early and tightens when Elara teaches Mara to “multiply paths” until stories overlap. Escalation is textural: each measured drop and card placement adds density rather than causal forks, sufficient under Accumulative lens. The visible cost is modest—Elara’s sleep, the loft’s inherited silence—but feels proportionate at this scale. A sharper loss (a card ruined, a resident ejected) could have pushed the band higher; still, pressure coheres and narrows to the final crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—access forbidden knowledge without being pattern-corrupted—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each new carving rearrangement thickens the archive’s resistance, narrowing her options until the hum forces a tactile test. The price is visible—the light physically clings, implying irreversible contamination—but the beat stops just before we see how it alters her next move, so cost is felt but not yet tactics-changing.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow’s hunger for definition is revealed. The single meaningful turn (footage overlay → word spoken) forecloses the option of doing nothing and visibly rewrites the library, paying a conceptual cost. Pressure escalates causally; a second intermediate complication would have lifted the band another notch.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—read the scar’s story—signaled early. Tightening occurs when each coffee ring forecloses denial, forcing visceral confrontation. Cost is present (scar burns, tears fall), but escalation is iterative rather than deepening; the same pain loop repeats with new visuals. Agency is observational; Mara never tries to refuse or alter the visions, blunting the final claim of “pride.”

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“free trapped creativity”—is signaled early and tightened when the jar of “The Dreamer’s Unspoken Truth” is opened. The meaningful turn is the irreversible absorption of the silver dust; options are reweighted because he can now “hear” unwritten work. Cost is conceptual (permanent solitude of the moonstruck) rather than concrete; visible price would raise the score. Pressure escalates through accumulative wonder rather than causal dilemma, fitting the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“cultivate the sparks or lose imagination forever”—is signaled early and crystallized in the soap-bubble tower. Pressure escalates once: sand dims → Kael chooses to twist the clock → sparks ignite. However, the middle lacks successive complications or resource losses; the woman’s exposition substitutes for mounting obstacles. Cost is conceptual (archive’s future) rather than viscerally felt by Kael, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single stake—access primordial chaos—is declared but never materially tested; no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from Elara. Escalation is a single beat: pedestal accepts gear → forest reveals itself as brain → father says “let go.” No tactical narrowing or resource lost; tension plateaus after the initial click.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—finding “unused courage” in others—stays abstract; pressure is situational (paths vanish, stamped tickets multiply) rather than personal. Escalation is accumulative: each stamped ticket thickens the vigil’s burden, but no single turn forces the guides to risk or forfeit anything they want. Cost is diffused across anonymous travelers; the guides pay only perpetual watchfulness, which feels more lyric inevitability than felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single dominant stake—maintenance of silence versus rupture—tightens when the wobble triggers Lady Veyra’s scream, forcing Elric’s hand. Escalation is one-step but sufficient for 700-word arc; cost is the audible fracture of the fortress covenant, paid in the child’s imperfect chord. Agency is reactive rather than proactive, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“unmask pretender”—is signaled early; escalation tightens once via the Silent Convergence clock that forces the pellet throw; cost is legible in the courtiers’ gasp and realm-crack sky, though secondary stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—arrives early and tightens when the plankton offers live coordinates. The meaningful turn is the decision to abandon the station and sail; it forecloses the safe path. Agency is shared but Lira leads, satisfying causal lens. Cost is conceptual (they may never return), yet no tangible resource is lost or body imperiled on the page, muting the felt price below 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“reignite the spark” of a stalled rebellion—surfaces early and tightens when the alignment window becomes non-renewable. The hum’s crescendo forces a public, irreversible act: Lira channels collective voice, narrowing her option to stay a private stargazer. Cost is legible in the bay-wide roar, though individual consequence is soft. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she seize or release engineered destiny?—is signaled when the plants whisper “choose wisely.” Pressure tightens once: dig before drones return. That single narrowing is sufficient at this length, and the cost (blisters, possible discovery, irreversible planting) is visible. No off-stage rescue; the embryo’s glow is the direct consequence of her agency. Stakes stay personal-local, avoiding telescopic bombast.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a pocket of unmoving peace—signals early and tightens once: the gust-triggered flashback narrows options to “stay anchored or drown.” Agency is interior (freeze, breathe, tuck) but forecloses escape; cost is the continued presence of grief. No external antagonist needed; wind as coincidence complicates, not resolves. Escalation is single-cycle, sufficient for 700 words, yet lacks a persistent environmental constraint that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: escape fragmentation or be crushed by it. Pressure tightens once: walls literally close, forcing the climb and thread-web ritual. Cost is visible—artist trades paint for thread, destroys tarot icon, stakes portrait at center—foreclosing old method. Accumulative escalation suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stake—recover lost brother via time anomaly—is declared early and personal. Pressure is atmospheric (elders’ warning, child’s oracle) rather than tactical; options do not narrow, but knowledge deepens when ink reveals tower. No visible resource lost or path foreclosed on page, keeping cost conceptual. Sufficient for 600-word lyrical mode, yet lacks a mid-scene squeeze that would propel tension above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. silencing—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when Lirael inserts the letter, foreclosing her archivist neutrality. Agency is present but the price (immediate exposure, job loss, arrest) is inferred, not witnessed; the tightening changes knowledge (Kael awake) more than lived options, keeping cost conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are thematic—preserve father’s pacifist legacy—but no external or internal force threatens that goal; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. The single “tightening” is the decision to bury the scrap, yet it encounters zero resistance, cost, or risk, so escalation is flat. Agency is present but unopposed, landing the story in the mid-band for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“catch the echo before patterns collapse”—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each spike strike thickens sensory density until the goddess’s touch crystallizes the tear-shaped constellation. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the goddess’s erasure stabilizes the sky but silences her forever. Agency is present—Kael chooses the final strike—but the price is felt more by the world than by him, keeping it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—moral integrity vs. family loyalty—tightens when the father’s margin command literalizes the environmental crime. One decisive deepening: coffee-stain memo forces trade-off between silence and act; price is instantaneous blood from nib and later social exile. Escalation is causal under lens; no convenience plotting. Closure in Q2 satisfies cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—silence the firmware or be consumed—signaled early; tightening occurs when Lira kneels in the nursery and trades baby-wail silence for personal memory, a visible price. Escalation is single but sufficient: each letter read shrinks the corridor, narrowing exit options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of audible grief—but remains legible on the page. Agency is decision, not combat, fitting short-form scale.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“can she decode the hush without destroying it?”—is signaled early and escalates through mandala tuning, tile urgency, and the ultimatum “interject.” One meaningful tightening: when the tile’s glow synchronizes with her chalk, silence becomes conditional; refusal is impossible without losing the grotto. Cost is conceptual (loss of outsider status) rather than visceral, visible in the final chalk stroke. Under causal lens, escalation is clean; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can the plaza be spiritually renamed after atrocity—tightens once via the mosaic act that forecloses passive mourning. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than external victory; cost is the acceptance that prevention is impossible, transformation is the only remaining option. Escalation is textural: each retrocognitive flash increases the density of memory until the single physical gesture crystallizes the stance. Under accumulative lens this single deepening is sufficient; price is legible in the final “warm coldness” that accepts perpetual grief inside hope.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—mend the fractured timeline or remain a looping ghost—arrives early and tightens through each echo-summoned spirit. Each arrival thickens the tapestry, foreclosing isolation as an option; the reversed Wheel coin externalizes the cost. Agency stays Elias’s: he chooses the crescendo that erases his own anchor. Price is legible yet soft: the coin blanks, but Elias simply fades, applause implied not endured.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—access hidden cognition without corporate pills—signaled in first paragraph and tightens when leaked memo confirms “adverse synaptic rewiring.” One escalation: geode alignment moment eliminates fallback to pills. Price paid is literal nerve burn and social derision risk (refusal of therapy). Agency remains internal-decision driven under causal lens; coincidence used only for complication (static), never resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—map the unknown vs. remain a physical cartographer—are signaled early; the golden spore beat narrows her future with visible cost. Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word scope; the final image makes the trade-off legible. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single stake—“spin prophecy into raw possibility”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when the echo resolves into audible counsel, foreclosing passive interpretation. Price is conceptual rather than visceral; options narrow only in thought, not in tactical resource. Agency is present but friction-free.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver the code while evading exposure—is signaled early; one meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses permanent transcription in soil, forfeiting retreat. Agency is present yet external pressure (antagonist presence, weather deadline) remains abstract; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page, capping escalation below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake is the preservation/continuation of the “palimpsest promise,” but it remains abstract; no live option is foreclosed on-page. Pressure is atmospheric (fog, silence, ticking gutters) rather than tactical escalation. Protagonist agency is limited to boarding and departing; no reversal or deepening changes his available paths. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized; tension plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—why entropy spares this patch—signals early; pressure deepens via pattern (sunlight denial → glass thrum → vision split). Escalation is textural density, not causal twist; cost is conceptual (oasis chooses which memory to keep) rather than bodily or tool forfeited. Sufficient for 600-word scope but could use one visceral price to hit 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reflecting light into dark corners—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through sensory accumulation rather than reversal. Escalation is textural: each tap of the gauge layers sound onto silence, each new recipient (cat, Mara) widens the circle. The tightening is the gift itself—Elias surrenders his private tool, foreclosing solitary comfort. Cost is felt but soft; the story chooses quiet shared vulnerability over a sharper loss, fitting the lyric mode yet keeping pressure just shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find the thread that connects all things”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when she must expose her own secret to the orb. The tightening is meaningful (option to stay hidden foreclosed), yet the price is symbolic rather than tactile; persistent constraint is present but lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the station alive and the sky sane—tightens when the board threatens funds, then again when retaliation becomes psychic. One meaningful deepening: the starlight chime replaces expected backlash, shifting the game from destruction to invitation; cost is the perpetual vigilance she accepts by pinning the taunting chart overhead.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve key or remain trapped—signalled early and tightened when corridor twists literally narrow his options. Escalation is physical: walls bend, key flickers, spatial mutiny raises cost each beat. Protagonist agency drives every turn; luck complicates but does not resolve. Price is visible—claustrophobia rebounds, cathedral begins to collapse—yet the stake itself stays abstract (“vital key lost to time”) rather than personal or moral, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—awaken collective empathy for a forgotten victim—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through tactile discoveries that make abstraction visceral. Tightening occurs when ribbon + handprint overturn the fall theory, forcing Voss to reopen the case; the price is Clara’s surrender of her private fetish to public evidence. Agency resides in her choice to hand Voss the charcoal and later to frame the relics; the external gain (justice) costs her solitary ritual. Under Accumulative lens, each sensory layer increases social pressure until detachment becomes untenable—effective, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover Marisol’s truth/exploit flake map—is declared early. Escalation follows pixel-reading → fiddle ignition → reality slippage; each step narrows possibility. Price is suggested (loss of prior world) but not yet felt in body or tool, so cost clarity hovers just under 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will Elias repeat the greed loop?”—is signaled early and tightened when each bill unsettles Marcus, narrowing Elias’s moral options. Escalation is textural: each new currency/note raises symbolic pressure rather than physical danger. Cost is conceptual (legacy, self-definition) and legible, though the startup’s off-stage ruin softens the visceral price. Sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—face the hidden violence—tightens once: vision of self-defense killing shifts guilt to acknowledged burden. Pressure escalates under causal lens (each spin of vortex narrows escape options) and peaks when spores force recognition; cost is the permanent carrying of an inert yet accusatory seed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—mend the covenant—signaled early; pressure tightens when labyrinth reappears and scars burn, foreclosing retreat. Agency moment: pressing clipping to heart splits world, visible price paid. Escalation driven by protagonist under causal lens. Cost legible; meets 9+ quick test threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—"patch holes in soul"—is signaled in para 2 and narrows to one live option: surrender certainty. The single tightening is the keeper’s line “He gave his certainty…”—a micro-turn that forces her to decide whether to sew. Price is visible: the skeleton’s meditative pose foreshadows her future stillness; the fruit’s foreign heartbeat is an embodied debt. Agency remains hers: she presses the needle, she bites; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—purpose vs. obscurity—signalled early (“after the applause, what’s left?”). One meaningful tightening: cloth refuses to be tossed despite Gus’s order, forcing Lenny to choose memory over wage. Escalation depends on accumulating recognition, not external jeopardy, fitting Accumulative lens; cost is opportunity-loss of easy disposal.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“reestablish connection to transition physics”—is signaled early and tightens once: the seed’s bloom proves transition is story, not equation, forcing her perpetual curatorship. Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversals or antagonist needed under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (endless unknowability) yet unmistakable in the final cadence. The beat could sharpen further if a concrete resource (time, data, bodily energy) were visibly depleted.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—shed identity vs. lose self—is declared early. Pressure tightens once: the dive forecloses retreat. However, the tightening is delivered via librarian exposition, not through an active obstacle; the woman faces no meaningful resistance or price beyond momentary “boil.” Cost is conceptual (she’s “lighter”) rather than viscerally felt, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—dissolve isolation walls—signalled in paragraph 1 and tightened once when the spiral demands the pearl sacrifice; cost is visible (loss of relic and vocation). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than combat, perfectly sufficient for an accumulative arc; escalation rides density shift, not causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—surfaces early (“map the labyrinth of her regrets”) and tightens through each graffiti aphorism that forecloses intellectual bypass. The deepest escalation is the shift from external deciphering to internal cartography: her notebook page turns from riverbend grids to heart-tributaries, a visible trade-off that reweights options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: medicated silence forfeited, raw breath now invested in every accordion note.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—access to hidden truth—is signaled early and escalates through measurable micro-tasks: charting delays, graphing cipher, selecting book. Each step narrows options under time pressure from the unreceived second letter. The act of documentation visibly changes tactics and foreshadows cost, but the absence of bodily or relational price keeps the tension largely intellectual; still, the tightening suffuses the final image with a conceptual fee—she can read the unspoken yet remains voiceless beneath her veil.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Perforated destiny is signaled early and tightens through each snapped string—every break drills a new hole in her possible futures; the final image transfers that perforation to the violin itself, paying the felt cost on-page, yet the pressure escalates more atmospherically than through a single irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled on page 1 and tightened when pool fissures leak starlight, foreclosing the option to repeat this ritual risk-free. Agency is continuous: her decision to embellish with moonlight symbols directly causes the stabilization and the grotto’s continued peril. Cost is on-page: physical drain, future threshold fragility. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her artistic gamble under rising physical collapse pressure. Sufficient for 8-band; reaches 8.6 because the price is visible and persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can trust be re-won?—is signaled early and tightened when the hairpin physically returns. One meaningful tightening: the shell discovery links to the hairpin’s missing scallop, forcing Lirael to test her forgiveness rhetoric against tangible evidence. Cost is visible—she trembles, then pins both shells, publicly locking her stance. Escalation is modest but complete for 700-word frame; no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Mira hear the dead husband’s truth—tightens when Elias dons the cloak and feels his own morality blur; this is the single meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is visible: he gives up the cloak and concedes interpretive authority to Mira. Agency is shared but Elias’s facilitation still drives the turn. No coincidence; wind chimes respond only to deliberate unhooking.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—doubt as filter, not enemy—emerges through the chime-harmonics image rather than assertion. Subtext surfaces in gesture: Mira’s fingertip brush of Elias’s sleeve is gratitude and mild erasure of his professional shell. Final image of wind-as-language reconfigures the premise without moralizing. No echoic thesis statement in last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—control of revelation—tightens when Elara refuses to verbalize the spiral’s meaning, trading immediate clarity for Lira’s deeper arrival. The helix ripple is the single decisive intensification that reweights options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Elara accepts the loneliness of never being understood in real time. Could edge higher if a tangible resource (time, health) were visibly forfeit, but the conceptual forfeit is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“learn to navigate without moving”—is declared early. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: birds signal, arrowhead hums, Kael watches. No visible trade-off or lost option on-page; the “dwindling people” remain off-stage. Closure reweights meaning but does not narrow lived choices; thus escalation is present yet mild.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can he recover personal meaning in magic?—is signaled early and sharpened by the automated-culture frame. Escalation occurs once: starlight pour collapses the labyrinth into a living garden and narrows his options to either claim spectacle or simplicity; the final sketch is the explicit trade-off. Cost is the forfeiture of grand illusions, visible in the withering of exotic plants. The single tightening suffices for 700-word scope, though a mid-story obstacle beat could have pushed score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will he face or keep dodging grief—signals early via key-tag and Lila echo. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pristine library forces confrontation: knowledge that sound has color re-prices his avoidance. Agency is present yet low-stakes; surrendering the key costs the talisman but no external consequence is dramatized. Pressure is accumulative/textural rather than causal; the escalation is a single density shift, sufficient for this length but not multi-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“decode or be erased by contraction”—is signaled early and tightens when static bursts refuse pattern until Kael risks bodily fusion. Agency drives escalation: arranging coins, selecting the moon-tower piece, activating distillation, accepting wavelength surge; each narrows options. Cost is legible (deck shudders, coins spark, body becomes conduit), though cosmic scale dwarfs personal jeopardy. One non-closure accumulation cap (−0.2) for minor redundancy between “static bursts” and “fractured timelines” descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“give names to nameless fears”—is signaled early and tightens when the echoes beg “Do not name them,” forcing Elias to risk re-awakening the monsters. The single deepening (naming → absorption) carries visible cost: the page grows heavy, the prism flares out. No secondary trade-off complicates the arc, keeping escalation efficient but not multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—heal rift via bell—tightened once when cracks widen under his real-time tweak; option space narrows to “accept imperfection or lose everything.” Cost is visible: shoulder welts, sun-baked tremor, public mockery. Coincidence only complicates (last fish), never rescues; escalation stays causal under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—town’s survival versus memory’s survival—is signaled early and tightened when the dam’s failure resurfaces foundations. The photograph trail is the agency engine: each laid image narrows Mara’s private archive into a shared one. Cost is conceptual but legible—she forfeits sole custodianship, embracing future accountability. Escalation is single-cycle yet sufficient for 700-word frame. No coincidence resolves; daughter’s arrival complicates, then Mara elects partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic & intuition to survive the coming merger—is signaled early and re-anchored at every sensory pattern. One meaningful tightening: the flame test forces a physical price that forecloses retreat to pure reason. Cost is visible (burnt fingertips, lingering warmth on crystal) and alters tomorrow’s tactics. Escalation accumulates via density of mirrored patterns rather than causal reversals, consistent with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“arbor unravels, city falls”—is signaled early and tethered to lunar deadline. Mid-scene tightening occurs when the first node shudders and projects jagged fractals, forcing Kael’s binary click choice; each stabilized node forecloses rest, visible sweat the price. Escalation is linear, not recursive, but agency drives every shift under causal lens. Cost accumulates physically and psychically, setting up the earned vigilance of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant custody-of-self stake is signaled early and tightens once via the energy duel; price (clone erased, Kael emotionally re-awakened) is legible but stated rather than felt in a beat; sufficient for 7-range, not the visible tactical loss required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve curiosity sanctuary—signals early and tightens when the seed threatens to rupture controlled space. Escalation is intellectual, not peril: each orthogonal test (envelope, chemistry, ledger) forecloses one explanatory path, pushing him toward organic surrender. Cost is conceptual—loss of designer mastery—rather than visceral, capping high-band entry. Coincidence (dream pre-viewing plant’s move) complicates but doesn’t resolve, permitted under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single stake—bring back laughter—signaled paragraph one; tightening is the incremental volume of echoes, not a reversal, but density accumulates credibly under Accumulative lens. Protagonist agency constant: each yank of cord is deliberate, exhaustion visible, so effort-price legible. No live option ever foreclosed; no moment where he could quit but doesn’t—pressure rises monotonously rather than pivotally. Hence escalation is present but not acute; story never risks failure, only fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—guard this reality vs. return home—tightens when the pendant’s call threatens to dissolve boundaries. One meaningful turn: toss the pendant, foreclose easy reunion, accept exile as price. Cost is legible in the hiss of sinking silver and the mentor’s lantern now hers to carry. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny via creative destruction—tightens when each failed approximation burns his skin and the last option demands self-essence. One meaningful reversal: from mending the relic to mending himself into it. Cost is visceral and accumulative; the price alters later tactics (scarred hands). Only a hair’s-breadth from 9+ because external antagonistic force stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and repeatedly tested by each dismantling. Escalation is steady: each stripped gear narrows options until only the hush remains, then the tower’s resurrection widens them into luminous possibility. The cost is largely conceptual (city’s old form dies), but Kael himself sacrifices almost nothing tactile; stakes would bite harder if his own identity or safety were on the block. Still, the tightening from static to river-of-light delivers a visible pivot that satisfies the short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—completion for vanished passengers—surfaces by paragraph 3 and tightens when Kael realizes merge = erasure of boundaries. One meaningful turn: the “Okay” consent that narrows his option from passive observer to active collapser. Price is visible—ferry, job, community dissolve. Escalation is linear under Causal lens; no false reversals, though external antagonist remains abstract (time itself).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“assure the unfinished truth reaches the widow”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the found hearing aid synchronizes pulses, shifting knowledge but not narrowing live options. No visible price is paid; Lila’s tactics never alter. Escalation is informational, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove the brother’s trace—tightens once: floodwater + hum → gold must be deployed now. Agency is present but the deployment beat is compressed; price (codex lost, facility falling) is shown more than felt. Still, the hologram blip narrows options to acknowledgement, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove life to the machine”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when OBS-7 orders “Choose.” The defragment act narrows options by rejecting binary alive/dead and accepting messy coexistence; cost is the eternal haunt. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten from observation to existential wager: each bird-pattern and echo-beat intensifies the possibility of total sonic oblivion. The diamond’s burn and the canyon’s roar make the price visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalations.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will Elara preserve human identity or surrender to harmony—is signaled early and tightens when the static forces metamorphosis. Escalation is causal: each confession thickens static → arrowhead heats → transformation. Cost is visible: loss of researcher identity, bark-skin, layered voice. One beat short of 8.8: no tangible forfeiture above-ground (job, sister) is shown on page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is signaled early and tightens when the first statue crack forces her to risk the shell. Agency drives every beat: she chooses to play past bleeding, to blow the shell like a flute, to accept the bridge’s tremor. Cost is visceral (snapped string, blood, empty sockets revealed), but the escalation is single-arc; no secondary reversal raises the ante further. Sufficient for high band, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—‘can silence be cracked?’—is signaled early and deepens when the bottle is surrendered, a single meaningful tightening. Elias’s agency is low-impact; he hands off the storm rather than facing soldiers himself, so pressure is observational. Cost is societal (guns lower, sky roars) but not personal; no option is foreclosed for Elias. Under accumulative lens the cadence shift is audible, yet protagonist skin in the game remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in quiet”—is declared early; pressure accrues atmospherically rather than through narrowing options. The only tightening is the moment wind bells fall silent under his song; this is a cadence shift, not a trade-off. No visible price is paid: shard warms but doesn’t wound, flowers rearrange but impose no cost. Escalation is textural (mist → playful mist → embracing mist) rather than causal; fine for Accumulative lens but keeps score shy of 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken dormant stories”—is signaled early and tightened once: the mirrors dissolve into floating manuscripts, narrowing options to “continue.” Agency is present (she lights the candle, steps forward), but the price is more wonder than loss; no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, fitting an Accumulative lens. Sufficient for length, but lacks visceral cost that would push higher.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: analog memory as living vibration, not slogan. The poem’s final couplet reframes the entire quest—“Seek me not in words, / but in the curves of your mind”—delivering Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (scarf knot at end) is stronger than any articulated thesis. Complexity is honored: skepticism softens but never vanishes, leaving plausible counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—tightens when colors refuse to blend, foreclosing the option to paint safely; visible price is the dream’s dissolution into unreachable particles. Agency is continuous: every sunrise shoot and brushstroke advances the risk. One meaningful deepening suffices; coincidence only complicates (light behaves), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—tightens once: the click forecloses the option of keeping the secret and visibly costs Elias his familiar world. Pressure grows accumulatively: each tumbler shift increases sensory density (cold, hum, blur). The disorientation is not an external rescue but the direct price of his agency. Cost is legible: ‘the world reshaped itself’ and he must now wander the starlit expanse carrying the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stake: recover the supposedly stolen memories before the site is lost to tide or time. Pressure escalates once: from mapping abstract star-fractures to lifting a single mushroom and finding Clara’s locket—options narrow to “now I possess the memories.” The cost is legible: forty years of obsession crystallize into custodial vigil; curiosity is no longer private but inherited responsibility. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is keeper vs erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the orchard’s color—tightens once: the seed’s demand forces her to risk the last relic. No reversal, but the deepening of sap-collection and rainbow eruption visibly forecloses the option to keep the seed. Price is transferred to the landscape rather than her person, nudging it below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: silence must be broken vs. fear of what voices will say—signaled on page 1 and tightened when Mara admits “I’m afraid.” Escalation is accretive: each loosened knot ups spectral noise, forcing faster needle-work; cost is fingertip ache and rising auditory haunt. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. One visible price: centuries-old net vanishes, key left as relic—Mara forfeits the safety of unfinished stories. The turn is micro but sufficient for 700-word canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Reopen the silence” is signaled early and tightens once: the footage comparison forecloses retreat—he must descend. Stakes stay internal-epistemic (will he hear meaning or break the world?) yet feel visceral through embodied sound and holy-water ignition. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is knowledge vs. void. Cost is visible—he forfeits daylight certainty for subterranean empathy—though could be sharper if one tool or relationship actually broke.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is epistemic: can Elara convert decay into continuity? One tightening occurs when hum=fork=globe proves intentional transmission, shifting her goal from explanation to participation. Stakes stay intellectual; no concrete resource (air supply, funding, reputation) is risked, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is singular but coherent under Accumulative lens; suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—articulate unsaid love/grief—signals early and deepens through each graffiti stroke; the storm provides the tightening cadence shift. Cost is felt (soaked clothes, trembling hand, plate clink), but the ghost remains passive, so external pressure is ambient rather than antagonistic. One credible loss is the irreversible fading of the glyphs, yet this is acknowledged rather than dramatized as a live obstacle. Sufficient for this length, but a beat of resisted decoding would sharpen trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will read, conceal, or share the captain’s truth—is signaled by diary discovery at 30% mark and tightens once when she translates the symbol through the goggles. The act of handing both objects to the widow forfeits the option to remain invisible, producing a visible trade-off. Escalation is single-step rather than deepening; no further complication tests her new stance. Cost is present but light—loss of secrecy—keeping the score solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—signals early and tightens through each cloud notation; the final drift into dawn crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. No reversals or resource losses, but density of emotional cloud-data escalates under Accumulative lens. Voss’s skepticism complicates without forcing adaptation; pressure remains internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the guild’s knowledge before dawn—is declared early and tightened by each mechanical clang outside. Escalation is situational but coherent: every beat reduces time and safe space, forcing Lira from observation to intervention (prying panel, relocating safe, repainting). Visible price is the impending physical destruction of the only archive; her choice to translate star-maps into pigment forfeits any future reproduction. No reversal beyond micro-turn, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single stake—retrieve the gears—is clear; pressure is atmospheric (cold, eerie portraits) rather than escalating through narrower options or higher cost. The only reversal is the mirror dissolve, which is a puzzle solved by pre-carried liquid light, not a tightening trade-off; consequence remains emotional, not tactical, so escalation feels static.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the arch or lose orchards and sky-peace—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each chalk message. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn message thickens communal resolve rather than narrows tactical options; the meaningful tightening is the bell’s elevation to keystone, a symbolic transfer that carries conceptual cost when Elara fades. No individual reversal or resource loss is dramatized, but the collective chant-and-rope beat gives visible effort. Cost is felt post-peak in the ghost’s dissolution—sufficient for 8-band, not the sharper price 9+ demands.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“will the end be scream or sigh?”—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens once when the pane’s vibration demands her imperfect voice as conduit. Escalation is causal: each nested fractal shrinks options until only cracked song remains. Visible price: porcelain in her skin, lighthouse groan, the irreversible slowing of global clocks. Cost is legible on the final line as the snow of shards settles over the cliff—no recalibration possible.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guide or wither—is signaled early and narrows to one live fork: stay hidden vs. keep marking. The birds’ dive supplies the single meaningful tightening; sparks force Kael to freeze, raising exposure cost. Escalation is causal, not cumulative, but the final crack of the nut makes the price legible on-page. Missing a second reversal keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—repairing the silent rift with Mara—is signaled early and tightens when the chrysalis mirrors their stalled emergence. The foam patterns provide one meaningful deepening that reweights separation as prelude, not wound. Cost is present (chrysalis relinquished, imperfect sonata), but pressure plateaus in the middle; the story tells us "grief loosened" rather than dramatizing a fresh test of that loosening.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—control over narrative void—signalled early; pressure escalates only once when stranger takes the jar, but Elara’s agency is observational, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (infinite stories now possible) rather than felt; no live option is foreclosed for her. Escalation is present but gentle; lens is Accumulative, not causal-turn driven.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Nessar blunt collective remorse without being lacerated by it? Pressure tightens once: the founder’s memory surges, Nessar gasps, stakes jump from curiosity to self-contamination. No second reversal, but that single escalation forecloses the option of neutral tasting; absorption becomes irreversible. Cost is legible—numb hands, wobble, lingering salt—sufficient for sub-800-word scope. Emotional contagion functions as antagonist; coincidence absent; agency preserved through deliberate subsumption.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—repair the weight to heal communal silence—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the elevator’s groans mirror the snapped chain. Escalation is textural: each added language layer thickens the acoustic texture until the final twelve-stroke chord forces villagers to listen. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elara surrenders her solitary vigil to public speech, her private lullaby becoming communal responsibility. No visible resource loss, so 8.8 gate not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: salvage abandoned dreams by grafting foreign memories onto self. Escalation is causal: each laser pass deepens feedback-loop risk until identity bleed becomes visceral (“taste of defeat like ash”). The tightening choice—continue etching despite neural overload—forecloses the option of safe withdrawal. Cost is visible: his reflection is replaced by a mosaic of strangers, a permanent cognitive rent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the seeds of vigilance before gravity flips”—is signaled early and tightened by the literal countdown. The inversion itself is the reversal that forecloses retreat; the key taken becomes the persistent constraint. Cost is visible (disorientation, scraped boots), but stakes never deepen beyond retrieval; no secondary loss or moral trade-off appears.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove sound can exist inside silence—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens through each strum. Escalation is accumulative: density of vibration, foliage, moss, then the single decisive intensification (shatter) that reweights stakes. Cost is visible—bled nails, broken relic—so pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“decode the covenant before simultaneous eclipse”—tightens when the dent glows and the queen-diagonal carves the night into a chessboard, foreclosing abstract theory and demanding embodied act. Agency is crystallized: Alaric chooses to plant the star-seed, accepting perpetual exile as tutor-gardener. Cost is visible: the tear, the irreversible planting, the mirror-leaves that will forever refract his loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode silence—tightens once: the clasp’s refusal forces the frequency experiment. No secondary pressure or price is visible; success feels low-risk. Escalation is textural (density of fireworks + hum) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—harmonize village energy—signaled in paragraph 3; tightening occurs when Lira abandons coercion for “wildflower hush,” a conscious forfeiture of control that risks lifelong ridicule. Cost is legible: elders’ scorn, her own fraying doodles, the one-time bloom stakes. No external antagonist needed; internal ambition vs. stillness supplies coherent pressure. Could wish for one sharper material loss (tool, time, social credit) to push战术 recalibration onto the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—planet’s resilience—stays legible; escalation arrives via the arrow tip’s heat and the vines’ crimson flare, tightening once. Agency is mostly navigational until the final insertion; the irreversible inversion is external gift rather than earned trade-off. Cost is conceptual (guardianship) not visceral, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover why the drone fell—signaled early and tightens when she realizes the yard itself is the culprit. Agency manifests in her decision to climb toward the flicker despite 45-mph gusts; this act physically risks her and unlocks the revelation. Cost is visible yet mild: breath knocked out, patch searing thigh—more sensory than strategic. No material resource is lost, and her later recommendation is off-page, so the price feels intellectual rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—is signaled early and escalates once: the cavern’s oppressive silence must be broken or Lira’s art is trivial. Tightening arrives when the aurora colors are weaponized into song; options narrow to “sing or surrender.” Cost is conceptual rather than physical: the cavern’s irreversible sonic birth certifies wonder, but Lira loses her private prism-song monopoly—wonder is now communal. Sculptor’s conversion is luck-adjacent, yet it complicates rather than resolves, keeping causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s mastery over failure through the flute—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each note adds psychic mass until the instrument physically breaks, foreclosing further attempts. The visible price (shattered reeds) alters tactics and forces the switch to silence. Cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can emotion be mathematized?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: fragment merges minds, forcing Elias to pay the price of unmediated feeling. Escalation is causal under lens: ambiguity tactic → fragment defense drop → empathy overload → press失控. Visible cost: his analytical detachment shatters, ink-splattered walls, tear-blinded goggles. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates (fragment’s agency).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: will Kail trust the relic’s pull or keep running? Tightening occurs once: woman appears + seed offer. Cost is conceptual—the pendant stills, implying he surrenders his old jittery identity—but not viscerally felt on-page. No credible loss of option or tool; escalation is purely imagistic. Agency is reactive; he obeys vibration rather than deciding.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—tightens when the arbor’s flare seems to confirm, then reverses when frost implodes. Cost is legible: her theory’s collapse forces public self-confrontation. One meaningful turn suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (“Veyra dies”) are declared early but never localized—no withered fruit on Jorin’s tongue or coin lost to blight. Pressure escalates only once: shards cut skin; no tactical adaptation follows. The trial is endured, not chosen, so agency is thin. Meets single-tightening rule for 600-word scope, but low visceral cost keeps it sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will he open the forbidden door?”—is signaled early via mother’s hologram. Escalation is single-cycle but effective: shard heat intensifies → portal offers reunion → rejection narrows future paths. Cost is visible: he forfeits the living mother and the certainty the shard promised. Pressure plateaus rather than deepens once he meets the alternate mother, keeping the score just below the 8.2 gate for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the felt safety of the light—survives the lamp’s death and tightens through each new note; escalation is pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens. Elias’s agency is reactive—he stacks, reads, places glass—but never initiates or risks beyond compliance; no option is foreclosed for him. Cost is off-loaded onto the absent chain-writers; the ache is atmospheric, not personally priced. One clear tightening occurs when the glass is returned to the sill, shifting the ritual from curiosity to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—control the dawn—tightens when the shadows first slither alive around her ankles, foreclosing the option to look away. Escalation is accumulative: each wick-tweak thickens the dark, until the final flare forces her stance crystallization. Price is conceptual: she trades innocence for custodianship of an unasked future.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—how to see/curate narrative magnetism—surfaces early and tightens once when the wing’s flare reveals the travelers’ shared aura. Pressure is largely contemplative; no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from Lin. The escalation beat is aesthetic rather than tactical, sufficient for an Accumulative arc but short of the visible cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“can sorrow be converted into usable knowledge?”—is signaled early and deepened when the sextant re-assembles into a dream-map. One meaningful tightening: the pin-drop re-occurs, forcing Elias to pocket the map and step through the newly permeable wall; option space narrows from “sketch more” to “enter now.” Cost is conceptual (he crosses a boundary he cannot reseal) rather than visceral, but is legible on the page. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; no credible loss or tool-break escalates tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm”—is signaled early and tightens through each song-capture. Agency is accumulative: every humming loop literally brightens the glass and frays night; cost accumulates in Lira’s hoarse throat and trembling legs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the perpetual-day twin realm dims, proving stakes are reciprocal. The price is atmospheric, not personal-loss, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent, keeping score shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she let herself be seen?—tightens from anonymous observation to compulsory self-recognition in the mirrors; the blank book and key force a trade-off between grief and exposure. Cost is legible: she forfeits lifelong invisibility for the letters’ emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred inside eroding normalcy—is signaled early but remains contemplative; pressure escalates only through quietly blooming saplings. The single tightening is the swap of vanished bread for sunflower seed, a conceptual rather than tactical narrowing. Agency is gentle attention, renouncing despair rather than risking anything concrete; cost is oblique. Coincidence (old woman’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve, keeping lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—save the library by recovering vows—is signaled in para 1 and tightened when “final word eludes her.” Escalation is accumulative: each sampled frequency restores one syllable but simultaneously proves time is running out (illusions bleaching, dawn approaching). Cost is visible fatigue and the perpetual threat of total erasure; agency sits with Elara’s iterative measurements. A second, deeper tightening beat (perhaps one vow irredeemably lost) would push higher, but current arc meets 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent weaponized trust-breaking recording—tightens through literal countdown and father-implicated blackmail. Escalation is causal: every failure refines next tactic, culminating in tower ascent. The playback of her father’s plea escalates emotional cost and forces her smash. Price paid: exposure of family shame, loss of fob’s intact legacy, market chaos; yet the tightening could feel one gear deeper if sunrise itself physically threatened escape.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“decode weather-carriers or remain blind”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the compass abandons people for the bluff itself, foreclosing Kael’s prior method. Protagonist agency: he kneels, tastes, drops the ring—each act narrows options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible: loss of epistemic certainty, copper blood-taste, surrender of trusted tool. No coincidence resolves; forest election release complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“uncork suppressed creativity”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: the act of painting the lock-mouth crystallizes into the shadow-door that can’t be unseen. Escalation is accumulative: each stroke increases the literal projection of his trapped scream until the only option is to insert the broken lock into shadow. Cost is atmospheric (auroral sorrow, chest-ache) rather than a concrete forfeiture, keeping it from 8.8+ bands, but the pressure is legible and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“recover mother’s last words”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the orb proves empty, forcing a choice between despair or seeding new meaning. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: lie detected → truth of recycling → renunciation of literal recovery. Cost is the forfeiture of intact dialogue, paid on the page. No reversal for the keeper, but their pressure is ancillary.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—keep wonder audible—signals early; pressure is steady melt-rate, not intensifying choices. One meaningful deepening: last droplet → stillness → chord that reweights meaning; under Accumulative lens this qualifies, but no option is foreclosed for Elara. Iceberg shrinkage is environmental clock, yet Elara’s agency stays observational; she never risks failure or resource loss. Cost is ecological and conceptual, not personal, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent inner overload—signals early and tightens once: the fraying seals force the burn decision. Escalation is singular but sufficient; options narrow from “ignore glitch” to “contain via fire.” Cost is conceptual (absorbing fears) rather than visceral, keeping pressure legible but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are declared (solve the mailbox) but never tighten—no clock, no rival, no risk of failure—so escalation is purely informational. The single “reversal” is the combo guess, which is luck-based, not agency-driven, keeping pressure modest and cost conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular: retrieve antidote or plague cure dies with the lab. One meaningful tightening: the drones descend, forcing the dance-as-weapon gambit. Cost is legible—lost lab, uncertain future—but on-page price is institutional, not personal flesh or forfeited want. Sufficient for length, yet escalation is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost memories—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates when gravity intensifies inside the chamber, foreclosing retreat. The coffee-ground spiral provides the single meaningful narrowing that funnels Elias to the wall panel; failure would mean permanent amnesia for everyone. Cost is visible: he must surrender his private reconnection to become guide, a trade-off legible in the final image of steady lanterns. Stakes stay personal, never ballooning into world-ending abstraction, fitting 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular—hush the prophecy or lose the sanctuary—and tighten only once, when the wing’s edge blurs. That single deepening is sufficient for lyric mode, but the absence of a second fork keeps pressure from compounding. Cost is felt (wing lost, silence transplanted), yet escalation is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the building wake?”—is clear early. One tightening beat: seal placed, blue glow, voice answers; cost is implied not visceral. Agency is present yet off-stage; the actual price (what the voice will demand) is deferred, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when each shell fragment adds resonance pressure, culminating in the garden’s ash price. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the memory spark landing: past pain becomes fuel, foreclosing retreat. No external antagonist is needed; internal conflict is the engine. Cost is visible on her glowing skin and in the ruined garden; tactics (circle ritual) are shaped by the resonance rule taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether the heirs will keep or relinquish vengeance—is signaled in paragraph 3; tightening occurs when the spiral key is drawn, narrowing options to “those who understand.” Protagonist agency is the act of endurance/renunciation: she forfeits the scroll rather than delivering it. Cost is visible: blood, hair, and the final silence that forecloses her presence. Under Accumulative lens the pressure is density-of-time rather than external antagonist, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“learn why some echo”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: each disclosure deepens knowledge without narrowing Kael’s options or forcing a renunciation. No resource is spent, no clock ticks, no antagonistic force resists him; the hooded figure rewards, never endangers. The single meaningful tightening is cognitive (stories are memories), not tactical. Visible price is absent, so escalation stays conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Kael release the ghost’s truth or hoard it?—is signaled early and tightens as each dream reveals a living relative still shaped by absence. The pressure is accumulative: every new dream-image increases the moral weight of disclosure, narrowing Kael’s options until silence becomes untenable; the cost is the emotional labor of transmission he must now undertake off-page. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—seal the stillpoint before wasteland spreads—is signaled early and tightened at the fissure beat. Agency drives every turn: she chooses to read, to carry, to place the flawed diamond; the price is the orchard’s survival at cost of certainty about Crane. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—wrest a usable future from dead voices—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the third-eye riddle forces invention of prism trick, foreclosing retreat to mere listening. Cost is visibility—he becomes the lightning rod the city will fear. Agency is continuous (tuning, writing, activating mirrors); no coincidences resolve tension.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can salvaged sound redeem both poet and village?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each uncorked jar thickens the audible past, tightening communal recognition and Elias’s own exposure. No false reversals; tension is density-driven, not plot-twist. Final cost—loss of exclusive access to childhood lullaby—is conceptual more than visceral, nudging the score down from top band, but the tightening is unmistakable and lens-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—key’s vibrational balance—signaled in para 1; sunset clock tightens once. Protagonist agency drives escalation: dial twist → sonic duel → stance crystallization. Cost visible (collapse, sweat, clatter) but second beat of loss (tool damage, stamina) only implied. Meets 8.8− threshold; lackspersistent constraint that would push 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“unyoke power without force”—tightens when hurried realignment scatters filings; the moonbeam cue forecloses the option of speed, forcing micro-degree patience. Cost is visible: night-long labor, locked grid, aching body. No external antagonist needed; internal impatience supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—prove the “accident” was murder—surfaces early and tightens when lantern visions contradict Cole’s verdict. One meaningful deepening: the files’ red “Eliminate” stamp escalates abstract suspicion to mortal danger. Micro-choice—she slams the file shut—signals resolve, but the price (risk to career/safety) is implied, not yet felt. Agency is internal; external stakes still gestural at word-count limit.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“will Marcus endorse the program?”—is signaled early but stays intellectual; the tightening is emotional (seeing the heart) rather than tactical, costing him only certainty, not status or resources. Pressure is situational: the storm and the fragile gears echo men’s fragility, crystallizing his stance. No live option is foreclosed; the program was already running, so his shift feels ceremonial. The cost is real yet internal, acceptable for lyric mode but below high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sound the unheard bell—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each kaleidoscope twist that narrows flight options. Escalation is causal: each image forecloses a prior glide path until only the suicidal dive remains. Cost is visible—acid mist eats tools mid-scene, *Skein* braces strain audibly. No off-stage rescue; the bell’s first vibration is paid for with the irreversible loss of the tip and the glider’s airframe.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the vanished astronaut—tightens twice: Hale’s lie blocks archival access, then encryption gates the video. Each 7-14-21 instance is an on-page reminder that options narrow to one set of coordinates. The cost is felt when alarms blare and drones advance; upload is irreversible. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the numbers were seeded by Elara herself, so agency stays causal under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—quiet the fear-storm—is signaled early; pressure is ambient, not option-narrowing. No reversal or trade-off is forced; Elara’s tactic succeeds exactly as planned, so escalation is aesthetic (aurora brightens) rather than tactical. Cost is implied, not dramatized; agency is present but consequence-free, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is whether Lila will keep moving toward self-erasure or let an ending come to her; the antique boat supplies that externalized test. One meaningful tightening occurs when the keening ice funnels her to the fissure—action becomes inevitable. Agency is present: she kneels, hooks, pulls, and later accepts the flicker of peace rather than claiming redemption. Cost is visible: the rescue offers no warm triumph; she stays seated on the ice, still wearing the same frayed gloves, the clinic option still open yet momentarily postponed.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: creative paralysis vs. human connection. One tightening—letter handed over—moves abstract mismatch into bodily choice: walk or retreat. Cost legible: Lila abandons canvas, Elias abandons spectator safety. Agency drives escalation under causal lens; coincidence only complicates (rain), does not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the echo”—is signaled early but remains abstract until the final sentence; no intermediate complication tests its fragility. Escalation is single-step: prophet’s touch ignites the ritual; no tactical adaptation or resource loss is shown. Pressure is atmospheric, not operational; the ritual succeeds exactly as intended. Conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance) is implied, notmanifest in a concrete trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—transmute pain into masterpiece—anchors early; pressure tightens when she realizes the collaboration is already complete. The tightening is internal and textural, not a causal reversal, but it reweights her ambition under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of authorship), visible in the final word, yet lacks an on-page forfeiture of time, tool, or opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—decode growth pattern—is signaled early; pressure intensifies through accumulating sensory fragments rather than external opposition. The meaningful tightening is the crystalline reflection that reweights his stance; cost is conceptual (messy truth vs. tidy categories) rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—capture the sound of aging—are declared early but remain abstract; the tightening is a sensory deepening rather than an option-limiting turn. Agency is present (he keeps arranging markers), yet the sound arrives as atmospheric gift, not consequence of a forced gamble. Cost is conceptual, not visceral. Pressure is lyric-cumulative; under Accumulative lens one intensification suffices, so the hum’s arrival satisfies, but barely.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—taming time vs. surrendering to escape—tightens when the hand’s spin becomes literal thrust. The meaningful turn is the moment Elias realizes the hand is measuring escape, not time; this reweights every prior repair ethic. Price is conceptual (loss of vocation) rather than bodily, but legible. Coincidence is absent; escalation is driven by his micro-interventions.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—tightens once: Elias speaks, proving the method, then dies. No further narrowing of options occurs; Mira’s next case is an evocative echo, not escalation. Agency sits with Mira, but the visible price (emotional fatigue) is implied, not dramatized. The hymn miracle resolves rather than complicates, letting coincidence do the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—is signaled early and tightens when the Weeping Archer window narrows to minutes. One meaningful escalation: the key-turn forecloses the option to remain ignorant, opening the backward-time gate with visible auroral cost. Agency is present but solo; no opposing pressure or credible loss beyond lost sleep. Coincidence is absent; escalation is legible but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can certainty be stitched back together?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the act of placing the two teeth either heals or fractures reality. Escalation is single but meaningful; the garden’s hum rises to a shudder, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible—Elias’s sacrificed years and Mara’s cut thumb—but the price is not re-paid in the final beat, capping it under 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes—“share light without fire”—are declared early; pressure escalates only via sensory density (zephyr bloom, mirror clarity) rather than narrowing options. The scale test is a micro-turn that visualizes balance but does not foreclose an alternative path; releasing the pearl is chosen before any obstacle materializes. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Lila will keep the amber sealed or let life infiltrate it—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once when she unclasps the pendant; option to preserve stasis is foreclosed as resin is pried open. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each graft (moss into amber, orchid into pattern, sapling into soil) increases density rather than flipping plot. Cost is visible—she physically breaks the seal and socially cedes curatorial control to Elias. No coincidence; all complications arise from her invitation to alter the relic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can she stomach an unfinished story?”—is signaled early. Mid-text tightening occurs when the seaweed woman declares “endings aren’t walls—they’re doors,” forcing Clara to shelve her neat resolution; cost is the public exposure of an unresolved manuscript. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each apparition adds density to the idea that messy hope is the only authentic shape. The price (loss of critical praise, self-doubt) is visible in the keystroke that erases the chapter.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—the translation of living pulse into cartography—signals early and tightens once when the plate hums against his heartbeat; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Agency is present but low-temperature; failure risk is off-stage (lost prior attempts) so on-page pressure is modest. Escalation arrives as cadence shift—snow pauses, silver pools—rather than irreversible fork.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“can the harvest resume?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Elias discovers the last intact gear must align with live light angles. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that the cavern itself is the instrument, not merely the container, narrows his options to synchrony with earth-tides. Cost is present (daily returns across the wounded season) but not viscerally felt at the climax; the victory feels frictionless, capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“collect weights, not wounds”—tightens as each calcified relic softens: lamp angle becomes irreversible resource, failure would trap souls further. One meaningful deepening: mother locket left untouched forecloses personal escape, price paid is endurance of inherited duty. Escalation is density-driven, not causal-reversal; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Could edge 9.0 if a visible toll (burnt hand, cracked lens) had been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform absence into holdable shape—tightens when the first cut splits silence; each shaving narrows the option to retreat. No external antagonist needed; the wood’s resistance and the memory’s bite escalate via accretion until the closed-eye lion forecloses further carving—visible price is the pile of “discarded seconds” that can’t be re-glued.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: forgive/let go vs self-haunting; signaled early by ghost’s dusk arrival. One meaningful tightening when camera is relinquished—this act forecloses the last hope of carousel repair and narrows Veyra’s options to surrender. Cost is legible: loss of scavenger identity & literal tool. Escalation is textural, not causal: accumulation of fragments peaks at release; pressure shifts from gathering to surrender. Coincidence absent; ghost functions as externalized conscience, not resolver.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove fractured systems can mean something new”—is signaled early. Escalation is one continuous because/therefore climb: sextant found → hum awakens → reroute → equation lights. Cost is the sweat, risk of electrocution, and the irreversible commitment of the relic; price is legible. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: freedom vs secure stasis, signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is gentle but causal: rain scent → forecourt pull → bear standoff → harmonic resonance → stance shift. One meaningful tightening: the singing quartz+bear forces a live decision—stay inside yet redefined, not escaped. Cost is felt: she forfeits the dream of wandering but gains a new listening post; the trade-off is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. manufactured history—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the blueprint exposes a literal “narrative machine.” One meaningful tightening occurs: the sundial’s shadow swings from horizon to warehouse, forcing entry. Price is conceptual rather than corporeal; the silence of morning radio never becomes a live deadline, so urgency stays cerebral. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each artifact layers evidence until perception cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“preserve ancient methods before industrial erasure”—tightens when each decoded knot forecloses Elias’s earlier belief that the loom is a physical place. Micro-turn: glass warmth signals irreversible shift from seeking to safeguarding. Cost is visible: he kneels, renounces claim, leaves glass as offering. No coincidence; escalation driven by his decoding agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can beauty be engineered?”—tightens through each failed gear-hum until the orb’s flare forecloses the mechanist path. Price is legible: centuries of metal dominance literally peels away. Minus 0.1 because the palace’s shift feels partly off-stage, slightly blunting the cost immediacy for Corvin’s own body/choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens once when the bird-release forces Lira to enact the same letting-go with the grain; the option to hoard guilt is foreclosed. Cost is visible: she forever forfeits the coin and accepts public stigma. Escalation is accumulative/lyric: pattern of sand-coin-bird-scar culminates in final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—liberate the sealed memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens each time the box’s hum sharpens; the eighth breadcrumb’s absence forecloses the option to quit. Escalation is Accumulative: density of reclaimed objects reweights the stake until the marble triggers the roar. The cost is legible—Lira’s raw knuckles, the city’s tremor—but no persistent constraint shapes tactics after release.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can fire be redeemed without violence?—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost reveals prior destruction; Lumin’s final stance crystallizes with visible cost (abandoning secrecy). No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices; escalation rides the Accumulative pings to the grove confrontation. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the last two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover the shape of collective grief”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens through each ancestral layer; the butterflies’ departure forecloses the option to keep listening to the voice, forcing the poem aloud. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external battle; cost is the shift from listener to speaker, ribbon faded but kept. No coincidence resolves; migration timing is thematic pressure, not plot device. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“restart the swing before chaos”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Hush lengthens. The rake’s inscription provides the single deepening that reframes her task from mechanical fix to ritual absolution; tide surge and ridge groan supply escalating sensory cost. No second reversal is needed under the lyric-accumulative design; agency remains hers, price is the searing palm and spent daylight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decipher or bury the tapestry’s secret—tightens once when the knight-thread mirrors the expired chess clock, converting a static artifact into live temporal pressure. The escalation is single but sufficient for the length; the price is conceptual rather than physical, paid when she accepts “the silence between moves” as perpetual guardianship, foreclosing the option to display her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“seed innovation within constraint of perpetual winter”—is signaled paragraph 1. Escalation is the lake’s groan narrowing options to “document it or admit madness.” Protagonist agency: her nightly climb to record star positions directly causes the equinox crack; luck merely reveals the result. Cost is visible: physical exhaustion, social ridicule, and finally the self-erasure of her data trove.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the next story fragment—tightens when the dirge appears; options narrow to “chase or lose.” No external antagonist; pressure is signal entropy, legible under accumulative lens. One credible loss: the broadcast fades, leaving only scrap; this alters tomorrow’s tactic (ledger entry). Cost is visible: trembling fingers, smile won then swallowed by static.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can art trap a vanishing emotion?—is signaled in paragraph two and never drifts. Pressure escalates once: Lira realizes the portrait must stay unfinished to let the viewer complete the feeling, narrowing her options from finish to forego. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the comfort of completion and leaves the gallery’s uncertainty unmasked. No second reversal is attempted; at 740 words, one meaningful tightening satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserve ancient navigation vs. Mara’s sell-it pragmatism—is signaled in the first 150 words and tightens once: Mara’s “Prove it” narrows Elias’s options to dig or concede. The price (bloody palms, backache) is visible and alters tactics—he keeps scraping despite pain. Under Accumulative lens the deepening of artifact density reweights the stake; coincidence is absent. A second tightening beat would push this into the 8.5+ band, but the single intensification is sufficient for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“save vanishing arts”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies only via accretion of participants, not narrowing options. One meaningful tightening: Elias’s first off-key sob, met by Clara’s hum, shifts texture but does not foreclose a path or exact visible price. Agency remains collaborative, soft; no tool breaks, no reputation lost, no time runs out. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will the seed awaken into communal hope—tightens once: the bud’s future-vision forecloses her option to quit, replacing trauma-memories with utopian ones. Escalation is textural: memory intensity and spectral glow accumulate until the single reversible moment (prune or not) is passed. Cost is conceptual rather than personal—no flesh price—but the irrevocable rerouting of the plant’s “neurons” is legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can wonder be rekindled before the city stays dark?—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when Clara realizes the drones died of disbelief. One meaningful deepening: her decision to speak publicly narrows her options and risks ridicule. Cost is visible: she stands alone at her booth trading social safety for civic magic. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the blackout—collective belief does, seeded by her candor.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“to understand why some houses feel alive”—is declared early, but escalation is accumulative, not menacing; pressure remains ambient. Objects accumulate rather than threaten, so tightening is pattern-deepening, not option-narrowing. No visible price is exacted from Lira; glow spreads consequence-free, keeping cost conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—heal the ocean—signals early and tightens when the ampoule is revealed as catalyst, not cure; the tightening forces Mara to assume guardian role. Escalation is textural: each blooming coral patch visually reweights cost under her skin. Agency is present—she chooses to drink—but external confirmation of blight receding is off-page, muting full 9-band price visibility. Still, the shift from passive seeker to active vector satisfies Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of loss via endless motion—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: rupture beat forces trade-off between owning the dice and witnessing their self-sustaining orbit, final cost visible. Agency is Kael’s throughout: pacing, counting, rolling, punching. Under Accumulative lens, density of die appearances, proofs, and taste repetitions reweights the stake until the last image. No secondary opposition or reversal; single meaningful intensification suffices but keeps this category below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—prove kindness lingers—remains abstract; no tangible risk or ticking clock raises the cost of failure. The only tightening is Mr. Voss’s arrival, a coincidental gift rather than an earned narrowing. Because the lost-language device never blocks or enables a concrete tactic, pressure stays atmospheric, not tactical; visible price is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“arts dying”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates via accretion: vanished bees → empty hives → fewer practitioners. The single meaningful tightening is the decision to host a festival; it narrows Lila’s private grief into public action, but no credible loss (time, reputation, lens endangerment) is dramatized. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; options never contract on-page. Coincidence absent; escalation remains coherent under Accumulative lens, but cost is only implied through absent beekeeper.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—defy fate by unlocking stone—signaled early; escalation proceeds via failed glow, coil fix, then irreversible lighthouse reversal. Each attempt costs material (mercury spill, string fray) and narrows options toward the point of no return. The island’s shudder externalizes cost, but Elias’s internal price (terror, isolation) is implied rather than felt on the page, keeping it below 8.5. Still, agency drives every beat; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early and tested in one decisive tightening: the lie-paradox. Agency drives the turn; coincidence plays no role. Cost (burnt palm, luminous clasp) is visible but not carried forward as a tactical limiter. Escalation is linear, not deepened, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“why do the watchers move?”—signals early and tightens when tunnel hum matches pulse, converting curiosity into survival. One meaningful deepening: journal reveals shells *hungry*, narrowing options to flee or confront. Cost is visible—city quakes, people scream—yet protagonist’s personal price (mother lost, city doomed) is felt more than bodily loss; still qualifies under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the real story before the petal deadline—is signaled early and tightened when the tunnel door resists. Escalation is Accumulative: each graffiti motif layers meaning until the shifted decade on the T reweights the stake. Cost is present but abstract—her prior narrative is invalidated, yet she forfeits no concrete resource. The lack of a visible price on her body or future keeps the beat just outside the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is signaled early and tightens when the hatch reveals her grandmother’s initials, forcing Elara to decide whether to add her own signature. The escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens: each note deposited increases the density of interlaced absence until the desk reweights it. Cost is visible: ink smears, boots waterlogged, inkwell now “dotted with stains”—persistent marks that cannot be undone. No reversal, but one credible tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when door map offers tangible path; failure cost is obsolescence of her indexing craft if myths persist. Agency drives each beat: stamp test, sketch spiral, vault breach; blackout complicates but does not resolve. Tension escalates under Causal lens; one meaningful turn suffices. Price paid is psychic (carrying Elara’s failure), not external, keeping it just under 8.8 high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into flight—signaled early; escalation arrives when lantern-light turns cranes airborne, foreclosing private grief in favor of shared sky-magic. Price (exposure to shadow, trembling) is visible; coincidence absent. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused potential pools”—is signaled early and tightens when the node threatens implosion. One meaningful deepening: she renames potential as “anger…grief” and steps inside, narrowing options. Cost is visible—observatory erased—but external rather than bodily. Agency remains hers; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“decode belonging”—is signaled early and tightens when alignment, not chip, becomes the obstacle. One meaningful escalation: lever pull shifts possibility space from retrieval to attunement. Cost is legible: ancient mechanism groans, stones wake, Lira’s heartbeat syncs with alien rhythm. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent under starlight countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep manufacturing silence—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the cedar vision forces a trade-off. One meaningful tightening: the split-heart carving makes the brother’s erasure visceral, foreclosing the option to stay neutral. Cost is legible: he forfeits his profitable safety and shoulders client pain. Slight drag: escalation is visionary rather than interactive; Lila never confronts him on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—trust across enemy lines—tightens once via the silent exchange; price is the cartographer’s palpable kiss-goodbye and Clara’s release of her mnemonic talisman. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than overt negotiation; still, the tightening forecloses the option to keep the pull as shield. Cost is legible but secondary characters’ terror feels reported, not shared, muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she navigate without inherited talismans?—tightens once: compass re-defined as regret-meter, foreclosing reliance on it. Escalation is accumulative/textural: pattern of scratches ↔ past choices, density peaks at lighthouse when needle points horizon not north. Cost is felt (leaving compass), not irrevocable physical loss; still legible under lens. Could use one overt tactical loss—e.g., mis-paddling east, wasting daylight—to push higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—empathy vs erasure—signals early; escalation occurs when reflections shatter, narrowing her options to “carry its weight with grace.” Cost is implied but not viscerally felt; no tool, stamina, or social credit is visibly lost. Because the lake functions as oracle rather than obstacle, pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“become bridge or let bond fray”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when each creature tribute makes refusal costlier. Agency is renunciation: she endures metamorphosis, foreclosing pure humanity; price is visible feathers and permanent hybrid role. Escalation is accumulative: each spice-scented beat adds density until skin itself rewrites. No coincidence; no false reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost maternal moment—tightens when the crack becomes a straight line, foreclosing endless search. Agency is continuous: unfastening sash, climbing, placing *The World* card. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation (cards, cloth, saucer) rather than external antagonist; the final image crystallizes stance with visible cost. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—open the sealed dimension or let the ship die—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: locket dims → ship shudders → shadow confrontation required. Agency sits entirely in Lira’s choice to undertake shadow work; cost is the locket’s destruction and her permanent bodily levity. Pressure stays causal and coherent; no reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“ignite a silent revolution”—is declared early but never sharpened into personal cost or time pressure. Tightening beat is the panel click; it changes location, not tactical options for the duo. No resource is lost, no path foreclosed; risk stays abstract. Escalation is situational; pressure is atmospheric rather than decision-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“restore the sacred order or lose the eels forever”—is signaled early and tightens when the storm-vision threatens total erasure. One meaningful deepening: reordering into Möbius strip narrows options by trading certainty for witness-stance; the price (permanent precognitive ambiguity) is felt on the last line. Agency is continuous; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unmask poetry versus Ministry erasure—signaled early. Tightening occurs when cartographer’s poem reframes scars as maps, narrowing Kael’s options to bare-all or stay silent. Cost: he risks capture by mailing uncensored poem; storm and wax seal embody that price. Agency drives turn: reading → writing → sealing. No external coincidence; escalation is interior deepening under observable threat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translation vs. victory—tightens once: the card’s stellar revelation forecloses “defeat the rival” and opens “collaborate.” Cost is visible (Kael’s blood, Elyra’s freeze), but pressure stays intellectual; physical wound is superficial, muting visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake: forge beauty from anarchy while surviving personality molts. Escalation is textural—each return to the tin thickens the question of whether identity is salvageable; the new poem delivers the decisive reconfiguration. No external antagonist; pressure is existential. Visible price: the perpetual loss of a coherent past self, acknowledged in the final smile. Could edge higher if the cost were rendered in concrete forfeiture (a relationship, shelter), but the conceptual price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—“memory erasure vs. preservation”—are declared early; pressure heightens once when mirrors shatter and Lira must choose to surrender the seed. The tightening is conceptual (fear vs. courage) rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed for Lira herself. Agency is present but symbolic; cost is off-loaded onto the collective. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a visceral price that alters her personal path.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling cosmic and terrestrial entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the institute demands “updates,” forcing Elara to choose between institutional legibility and her new methodology. Her agency drives escalation: she sends spectra of dust instead of neutron stars, risking professional irrelevance. The cost is legible in the symposium’s mixed reception and the botanist’s tentative collaboration—a narrow path forward forged through renunciation. Coincidence (the chrysalis) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s daily monitoring makes its emergence a product of her attention.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning after survival—is signaled early and tightens when frost reveals the smuggler’s method, forcing Lirael to reinterpret her art. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow frost, crawl the crevice, interpret the shard. Cost is felt in her hollowed creativity and the renunciation of familiar craft. The phrase “In the pauses, the truth breathes” crystallizes stakes without resolving them mechanically—pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving silence can express as powerfully as sound—is signaled early and tightens when Elias witnesses the first vibration, raising relational stakes. The deepening occurs with the lullaby memory, which aligns forks into harmony, forcing Lirael to accept vulnerability as necessary for art. Cost is felt: she risks exposure to observers, yet retains control by refusing spoken validation. Agency drives escalation—each experiment is her choice—but the resolution leans slightly on Elias’s interpretive role, softening the protagonist’s sole ownership of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving lost signals—tightens when Marisol reveals the city’s heart stopped; Elias’s agency deepens as he welds glass despite cold and doubt. The meaningful turn is his dream-induced shift from refusal (“I’m an undertaker”) to acceptance (“My rest is here”). Cost is felt: decades of buried grief redirected into preservation. Coincidence (the package) complicates but doesn’t resolve; repair requires sustained labor under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—communal survival under sanctions—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses transparency over mystery, narrowing options (risking donor withdrawal). The tightening is protagonist-driven: her declaration forces a trade-off between safety and solidarity. Cost is unmistakable: anonymous aid stops, replaced by exposed vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens into healing through revelation. The single tightening occurs when Lira shifts from documenting shadows to activating compassion via breath, narrowing her artistic purpose. Cost is conceptual (abandoning detached observation) but not visceral; no tangible loss or irreversible trade-off marks the turn. Escalation is driven by agency under an Accumulative lens, though pressure remains lyrical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when Elara uses the fragment to “disintegrate the barrier,” risking cognitive and spatial collapse. Her agency drives escalation: placing the fragment triggers the garden’s shudder, then full disintegration. Cost is unmistakable: lost visions, inert artifact, and irreversible epistemological shift. Though pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, the turn lacks a tangible trade-off beyond internal realization; the garden heals too cleanly, softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resilience against ecological collapse—is signaled early and tightens when scavengers arrive, forcing Lirael to choose between stealth and confrontation. Her agency drives escalation: decoding keys, descending, then shattering the vial. Cost is visible (chains, time, risk) and culminates in the irreversible release of seeds. Minor flaw: scavengers feel like generic pressure rather than individuated threat, slightly flattening opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing betrayal’s frequency—is signaled early and tightens when the initial mixture proves insufficient, forcing Lira to sever the root. This escalation arises from her agency, not coincidence, and exacts cost: pain, irreversible destruction of biological memory, and emotional exposure. The final hearing aid doesn’t resolve grief but reconfigures it into audible form, foreclosing naive hope. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the “grinding frequency” beat could deepen tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—stealing illuminated moments—tightens when the jar demands reciprocity, forcing Elara to risk her most guarded memory. Agency drives escalation: her flower code bypasses defenses, but the true test is internal (giving vs. taking). Cost is felt in the wilted lily and emotional exposure of surrendering the photo. Coincidence (guard’s snore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the trade-off is protagonist-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (“craft safe zones for inquiry”) tightens meaningfully when the schematic reframes “safe” as “inquiry” zones, forcing Kael to choose between idealized safety and fragile curiosity. His agency drives escalation: narrating tasks → reinterpreting the crack → discovering the compartment. Cost is felt conceptually (abandoning perfect answers) but lacks visceral on-page forfeiture—no tool lost, time wasted, or physical toll. Still, the deepening from “blueprint” to “testament of desperate hope” credibly narrows his options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity from inherited lies—tightens when Lila chooses to confront rather than flee, trading physical safety for truth. Her decryption act deepens stakes by exposing the mob boss’s vulnerability, directly causing his arrest. Cost is felt in her isolation and the mother’s delayed redemption. Escalation is protagonist-driven: fear fuels agility, not coincidence, satisfying the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night through summarizing silence—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the last star winks out, forcing completion under total darkness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each ink stroke requires distilling a distinct hush, narrowing options as physical fatigue mounts and the booklet sheds. Cost is unmistakable: extinguished stars, aching hands, and the fort’s groaning opposition crystallize in the final Charged Poise—she walks into erased footprints, trading permanence for ephemeral truth. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the storm’s passing merely enables the pressure Mara imposes on herself.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating thought’s origin—is signaled early and tightens when the violin reveals temporal access, forcing Unit-17 to choose between janitorial duty and existential traversal. Agency is clear: playing the violin weaves loops, dissolving the instrument at personal cost (loss of conduit). Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via layered holograms and self-encounters, though the “test” revelation slightly leans on exposition over dramatization. Cost is legible: eternal observation replaces simple sweeping.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honesty beyond words—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to follow the doodle-map, risking routine for ambiguity. The tightening occurs when Lira reveals tickets are “keys,” raising the cost of continued silence. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he seeks the lens, walks the forecourt, decodes messages. Cost is felt in his abandonment of log-writing—a renunciation that forecloses his old role with quiet finality.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens remember human care—is signaled early and deepens when Joren arrives as a representative of the algorithmic worldview. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she blocks a sensor, forcing recalibration, which tightens pressure by testing her philosophy in real time. Cost is felt conceptually (isolation from modern gardening) and physically (gnarled hands), though no tangible loss (e.g., tool, time, injury) alters tactics mid-scene. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; victory comes through earned method.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving time’s nonlinearity—is signaled early and tightens when the nexus destabilizes, forcing Veyra to choose between aborting or risking catastrophe. Her agency drives escalation: she initiates activation *and* executes recalibration. Cost is visceral (panic, physical strain) but resolves cleanly without lasting consequence, slightly undercutting the “felt price” needed for 8.8+. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes—proving the ghost’s existence and completing his symphony—are signaled early and deepen when the program reveals coded notes matching Clara’s sheet music. The surge from the broken pipe raises physical cost, forcing memorization over preservation. Agency is clear: Clara chooses to decode, reach for the bow, and vow completion; coincidence (the pipe burst) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she earns closure through attention and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional lie—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael discovers the “QUARANTINE” folder, narrowing options to complicity or exile. Her agency drives escalation: reading maps, redrawing roots, descending. Cost is unmistakable: loss of status, certainty, and professional identity. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases via recurring smudges until the final act reweights all prior tension with visceral clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens when the valve activates the machine, foreclosing escape. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, insert the wheel, and ultimately leave it behind. Cost is felt in the chamber’s revelation and the final burden. The “ghost shift” concept deepens stakes but borders on thematic abstraction; however, the concrete cover-up (profit over lives) grounds it with moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing judgment-free witnessing—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: each fold forces physical sacrifice (scraped hands, distorted reflection), narrowing options until the keeper must “shed another layer of self.” Agency drives escalation (unfolding swan, pressing palm to door); coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt: the keeper’s identity fractures in the pool, and the refuge vanishes upon return, proving its state-of-being nature. One tightening suffices for this length, though a second deepening (river flowing backward) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—nurturing wonder against skepticism—tightens meaningfully when Mara closes her eyes, risking vulnerability. This agency-driven deepening (not coincidence) forces her renunciation of bluntness, paid for in emotional exposure (“voice lacked its usual edge”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (eclipse, music, curl) intensifies the choice to believe. Cost surfaces in Mara’s cautious exuberance—a fragile, hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering ignored stories—is signaled early and deepens when Clara’s diary reframes the “axis” as perception, not space. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his probing uncovers the tapestry, transcribes symbols, and culminates in vocal acknowledgment, which actively restores the axis. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: decades of ghosted narratives demand witness, and silence is revealed as complicity, not absence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering paternal legacy to redirect fate—is signaled early and deepens when letters reveal fortunes are keys to revolution. Elara’s agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, reading, then rewriting destiny. Cost is felt in the burden of orchestration (“flow you direct can become a flood”) and visible in the dockworker’s altered path. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the storm complicates but doesn’t solve. Slight cap for lack of tangible personal forfeiture beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing possession by unraveling stillness—is signaled early and tightens as each loop strains the anchor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: rhetorical devices compound into dissonant harmony that physically warps the machine. Cost is visible in the anchor’s cracking, sparks, and eventual disintegration. Though pressure coheres well, the “possession” remains abstract, slightly muting visceral stakes despite strong conceptual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting the past through cryptic fortunes—is signaled early and deepens via the tightening pressure of “before exhaustion hits.” Lirael’s agency drives escalation: she writes faster as dawn peaks, using memory-mapping as method, with the cost of fraying thoughts (“static”) made legible. The stakes remain viscerally felt through embodied details (visible breath, trembling hands), though the opposition (time/exhaustion) lacks personified resistance, slightly limiting tactical adaptation. Still, the single meaningful deepening—dawn’s peak triggering the shell’s flare—is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and deepens through timeline confrontations. Each shard tightens pressure by revealing costs of alternate choices (isolation, lost love). Agency drives escalation: Mara actively chooses paths, retraces steps, and ultimately renounces flight. Cost is unmistakable in her grounded walk, though one tightening (the alley shift) leans slightly toward summary over scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when Lila fits the copper wire, narrowing options from repair to transformation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she selects the record, flips it, lowers the arm. The cost is felt (“chest ached… with the weight of feeling”) and alters tactics—she later brings students to share the hush. Coincidence (finding the cavern) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to embrace backward song.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional silence—tightens when Elias abandons his route for the rooftop, foreclosing safety. The woman’s warning (“Trust no one”) deepens stakes by revealing engineered illness, forcing Elias to choose between data purity and human cost. Agency drives escalation: his cross-referencing and sample retrieval narrow options under rising biohazard pressure. Cost is felt in the burned note—a sacrifice of evidence for dissemination.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered grief—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael risks UV revealing. Her agency drives escalation: uncorking the vial forecloses avoidance, forcing confrontation with inherited sorrow. Cost is felt (tears, trembling) and visible (steady fingers post-revelation). Coincidence (sunset activating UV) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the method’s risk is established beforehand, making the payoff earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering “the texture of time”—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes his poetry was evasion, not preservation. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: he chooses to untie knots, releasing memories, which narrows options from escape to confrontation. Cost is felt in “weight of every unwritten line” and the spiral’s revelation. The being’s prompts complicate but don’t resolve; Kael’s hands drive the turn. One tightening suffices, but stakes remain slightly abstract despite visceral imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming communal grief through music—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes the bowl holds “space” not silence. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from solo performance to collaborative ritual (crowd adding objects), narrowing her role from echo-harbor to conduit. Cost is legible: she risks public failure to break the “wall” of silence, and the crowd’s tentative voices afterward show irreversible change. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—crafting emotionally sustainable half-truths—is signaled early and deepens when Lira requests forgetting. Elias’s tightening choice (offering *Eclipsed Memories* with explicit cost) narrows options: she must accept loss of joy to ease sorrow. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, though stakes stay internal and lack external consequence. Cost is felt (“Only as much as truth itself”) but not dramatized beyond dialogue; no visible forfeiture occurs on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—acknowledging the unseen—is signaled early (“ache of unspoken things”) and tightens when Clara sees Lila’s overturned cart, foreclosing her prior indifference. Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency: she traces the address, forges the letter, initiates contact. Cost is felt in her vulnerability (“pulse quickening”) and professional risk (clients’ confusion). Coincidence (envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Clara’s choice to act.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rekindling connection in a fragmented world—is signaled early and tightens when visitors dwindle, raising emotional cost. Kael’s agency drives escalation: studying tags, following Lira’s clue, camping under the arbor. The “shared search” deepens stakes by testing belief in kinship, and the climax forces stance crystallization: he must trust the thread. Coincidence (Lira’s guidance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the discovery hinges on his persistent attention to light’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the canals’ “breathing”—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant reacts, raising personal and metaphysical stakes. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Lila chooses to twist the pendant, triggering time dilation. Cost is felt—she endures disorientation, witnesses her own mortality—and crystallizes in Charged Poise: she’ll return, knowing echoes hide in pauses. Coincidence (giant stirring) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering her brother’s “final message”—is signaled early and deepens when the ritual reveals his face in the glass. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes preservation requires flow, not fixation, foreclosing her prior approach. Agency drives escalation: her choice to pour sap triggers resonance, and her touch completes the dovetail. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability, tears) and conceptual (abandoning the quest for neat answers), though the absence of external opposition slightly limits pressure range.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible to serve the vulnerable—is signaled early and deepens when the tape reveals a communal cache. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification (static → voice → message), narrowing Mara’s options from passive patrol to active stewardship. The tightening occurs when she chooses to pry the grille, accepting risk. Cost is conceptual (loss of anonymity) and felt in her trembling breath, though not yet dramatized as tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and deepens when the hellebore metamorphoses despite Eleanor’s interventions. The meaningful tightening occurs when she withdraws her hand, foreclosing her old methodology with palpable cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each observation intensifies her realization. Coincidence (storms returning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; transformation stems from her choice to witness, not intervene.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning after collective trauma—is signaled early and deepens when the brooch offers not answers but a method. Marin’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow rain, engage the stranger, and grind the brooch into pigment. Cost is felt in her abandoned artistic rigidity and the irreversible shift from extraction (“threshing”) to receptivity (“listening”). Coincidence (rain revealing brooch) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the exchange is her deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and deepens when the pilgrim reframes it as embracing chaos. The tightening occurs when Elara accepts the pearl, foreclosing her prior belief in controllable harmony. Cost is felt in the cave’s shattered song and her altered perception. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her choice to grasp the pearl), though the pilgrim’s role edges toward deus ex machina; his function as catalyst slightly dilutes Elara’s sole ownership of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is signaled early and deepens through each site visit. The meaningful tightening occurs at the plaza: vendors avoid it, children whisper, creating social pressure that culminates in the girl’s approach. Cost is felt in the harbor’s lingering scars and emotional hesitancy. Agency is subtle but present: Lirael’s method *creates* the conditions for memory collisions. Coincidence (fisherman, girl) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her persistence earns the fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when arrows shift from documentation to guidance, forcing Elias to act beyond calculation. His dare (using the ticket punch) is agency-driven, narrowing options from observation to irrevocable participation. Cost is felt in the loss of the woman and the old map, replaced by unknown routes. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of glowing arrows, heartbeat rhythm, and hologram projection deepen pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sculpting space for reflection—is tested when the tile demands active interpretation, not passive observation. Clara’s agency drives escalation: choosing to transcribe transforms her from escapist to conduit. Cost is felt in cramped hands and inherited doubt, but most sharply in her softened skepticism—a relinquished intellectual armor. Whale songs complicate (not resolve) tension, their “unheard symphony” mirroring Clara’s struggle to trust non-rational truth.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escape from cursed stasis—is signaled early and tightens when the solar storm weakens the amulets’ hold, forcing a now-or-never choice. Agency drives escalation: Kael follows the rumble, interprets the spatial mutiny, and ultimately chooses to press fragments together. Cost is legible in the cracked mirror’s hollow self-image—a live option foreclosed. The storm complicates but doesn’t resolve; the protagonists’ joint action breaks the loop under coherent Causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—securing asylum to protect her father’s life and math—is signaled early and tightens when agents reveal they know about Elara. The meaningful deepening occurs when she tastes the ink, gaining insight into their fears, which directly enables her bluff. Cost is unmistakable: she trades irreplaceable proof for uncertain safety, and the “clear” ink shows her resource is exhausted. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under Causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting lost time’s textures—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp’s hum syncs with her breath, narrowing her focus to transcription. Agency lies in attention: she chooses to write “furiously” despite trembling, foreclosing ordinary life (implied by townsfolk’s prior dismissal). Cost is conceptual (social marginalization) and physical (calloused hands, isolation), though escalation lacks a tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing health or relationships). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the hum’s shift arises from her sustained presence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased identity—is signaled early and deepens via the locket revelation. Pressure escalates through Kael’s active collection of fragments, culminating in the realization that his scavenging was reconstructing a conspiracy. Cost is felt in the loss of assumed innocence and the burden of truth. Agency drives escalation, though the storm momentarily risks externalizing tension; Kael’s climb reaffirms control.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating the universal riddle—is signaled early and tightens when the shell’s hum syncs with the cello, forcing Lira to abandon pure logic. Agency drives escalation: her decision to play the cello triggers the climax. Cost is felt in the “ache” of relinquished certainty and the irreversible shift from debunker to believer. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the astronomer’s journals merely enable her earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the carnival’s chaotic soul against sterilizing privatization—is signaled early and tightens when the spiral-square symbol reveals a deadline. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, organizes, and weaponizes graffiti into a map of resistance. Cost is unmistakable: enduring dual loyalty strains her credibility with both sides, and victory is fragile (Council retreats but may return). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Jax’s support stems from established alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving human witness against automation—is signaled early and deepens when drones arrive, compressing time and raising emotional cost. Lira’s agency is clear: she triggers the vial despite knowing no one may see it. The tightening (17 minutes left) forces decisive action, narrowing options to one symbolic gesture. Cost is felt: her archive photo gathers dust, yet this renunciation crystallizes her stance. Escalation stems from protagonist choice, not coincidence, though the drones’ timing slightly borders on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ensuring the *Horizon’s Breath* launches safely—is signaled early and tightened when HB-7’s fracture reveals deeper servo corruption. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the water method, interprets light patterns, and executes both patch and recalibration. Cost is felt in the burden of responsibility (“mended the invisible, one patch at a time”) and the implied toll of perpetual vigilance. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—density of sensory feedback increases until clarity emerges, not through luck but disciplined perception.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering why rivers flow—is signaled early and deepens when the map reveals *The Singular Convergence*. Clara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow, chip the ice, interpret the glow. The cost is conceptual but legible: maps must now lie to point toward truth. Jorn’s warnings heighten risk without resolving it; the world’s “out of sync” nature complicates but doesn’t solve—Clara earns the insight through endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving shared balance through rhythm—is signaled early and deepens as footsteps coalesce into community. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → faint steps → bell’s cry → human voices finding pitch. Kael’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is felt in the townsfolk’s gauntness and Kael’s solitude, though the story avoids explicit trade-offs—hence just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the temple before the storm floods it—is signaled early and escalates through sensory and temporal pressure. Mara’s agency drives the climax: her choice to uncork the vial and endure the voices, rather than flee, narrows her path irreversibly. The cost is clear—the dissolution of preserved memory—and the deepening (hush as prison) reweights her original goal. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; all turns stem from her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—writing truth against inherited lies—is signaled early and deepens when the lattice blooms into a pen. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to hover, enter the chamber, and place his lattice beside his father’s, each act narrowing escape into myth. Cost is legible in the dissolving walls and bleeding stone, though the “bodies” remain abstract. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the price—confronting narrative destiny—is felt without being mechanically resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt—is signaled early and tightens when Elara’s experiment forces the ghost’s hand. Escalation stems from protagonist agency: Elara’s curiosity deepens into understanding, altering tactics from passive receipt of fruits to active bead placement. Cost is felt in the ghost’s “soundless scream” and dissolution, though the bead’s warmth slightly softens the price. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the ghost’s centuries-long setup converges causally with Elara’s choice under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending broken precedents through devotion—is signaled early and deepens when Lira chooses the spiral path, trusting dream logic over clarity. Agency is clear: each sewn thread narrows options, culminating in the final stitch that forecloses ruin. Cost is felt physically (raw fingers) and symbolically (emptied plates), altering tactics by forcing reliance on voice and memory. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of threads, encounters, and chambers intensifies until the cavernous heart crystallizes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (restoring faith) tightens meaningfully when the sundial’s activation demands Lirael’s choice—follow or abandon. Agency drives escalation: her wandering uncovers resources, her alignment triggers magic. Cost is felt (fever, storm delays) but not visibly paid *after* turns; the shrine rebuild lacks tangible sacrifice beyond time. Still, the final image reweights stakes: faith as ongoing labor, not ritual completion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering “The sky remembers”—tightens when the new letter echoes the old, raising emotional and existential stakes. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to scan margins, descend stairs, dip into the fountain. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and crystallized in her final renunciation of passive decoding for active teaching. Coincidence (carrier’s arrival) complicates but resolution stems from Lira’s persistent methodology, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving cosmic truth against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Jaxon reveals the council’s telescope removal. Zara’s agency lies in renunciation (not fighting) and attention (decoding starlight), culminating in activating the chart via flame. The cost is felt: her “foolish” cover is nearly pierced, and the coup’s imminence raises stakes without coincidence resolving conflict. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening through symbolic density rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving unsaid apologies—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael kneels to evoke letters, narrowing options to ritual action. Escalation is Accumulative: spirits’ songs swell, droplets coalesce, shard glows—all deepening pressure without new complications. Cost is felt (emotional labor of reading vanishing messages) but lacks concrete forfeiture (e.g., time, tool loss). Agency is attention/endurance, valid for this lens, though a sharper trade-off would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether shared language can heal collective trauma—is signaled early and tightens when talks collapse, forcing Lira to pivot from diplomatic translation to emotional decryption. Her agency drives escalation: each rewritten note (“The war ends when we choose to listen”) narrows options by rejecting passive despair. Cost is felt in the persistent “ache” and the rubble of the bombed aquarium, but the peace table breakthrough borders on optimistic without showing tangible consequence beyond the general’s single line.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering joy—is signaled early and tightens when the fresco fragment demands public display, raising personal risk. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she gathers stories, weaves light, invites witnesses. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and the implied vulnerability of hope in a place defined by loss. Coincidence (finding the fragment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to exhibit it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unearthing hidden memory through sound—is signaled early and deepens when the nickel harmonizes with the garden, forcing Marisol to shift from visual restoration to auditory bewitchment. The tightening occurs in her whispered plea, which narrows her method to pure receptivity. Cost is clear: she surrenders control, accepting that truth emerges only in liminal pauses. Agency drives escalation—her weeks of alignment culminate in today’s resonance, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—covert communication against surveillance—is signaled early via Lillian’s lecture quote and deepens when the seed’s “Class-3 disruptor” status raises stakes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he encodes “RESIST,” seeks amplification, and passes the orchid test. Cost is conceptual (risk of exposure) and felt (the city’s sudden attention), though physical or relational sacrifice remains abstract. The fungi-spore beacon represents a meaningful tightening: moving from hidden patterns to public defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty without losing its truth—is signaled early and deepens when the postcard reframes poetry as bridge, not shield. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Lira chooses exposure over enclosure, offering poems to the wind. Cost is felt in lost vigilance (insomnia fades) and irreplaceable solitude. Coincidence (postcard arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her sustained attention and renunciation of control.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving equilibrium against unraveling emotions—is signaled early and tightens when the tube cracks. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: she rejects the director’s fatalism, dismantles the chime, and risks awakening extinct feelings. Cost is felt in the museum’s trembling mist (“joy” and “grief” blurring) and her “heavy and light” heart. The deepening—preservation requires fracture—narrows options to one irreversible act: singing into the break.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through linguistic reconstruction—is signaled early and deepens causally: translating Old Brythonic becomes a proxy for mending silence with Mira. The tightening occurs when Henrik challenges her (“You’ll never find the context”), forcing Elara to prove that “promises are interconnected.” Cost is felt: hours of labor, emotional exposure (“her throat tighten”), and the risk of rejection in the final call. Agency is clear—every archival move stems from her choice to pursue “symphonies of truth”—but the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (Cadogan descendant donating *exactly* the right prayer book).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding encrypted compassion—is signaled early and deepens via Lira’s realization that the cipher is a “confession,” not just code. Escalation is driven by her agency: each measurement tightens interpretation, culminating in vocalized truth. Cost is felt in the sender’s exposed fear and Lira’s renewed burden (“floodgates outside would hold, and so would the fragile trust”). One meaningful deepening suffices, though external volcanic pressure remains slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of lost songs—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger reveals the Cairo delivery and the cassette tape. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to ignore clients, play the tape, sketch symbols, and ultimately journey himself. The cost is legible—lost income, fractured identity, emotional vulnerability—and tightens options until only personal pilgrimage remains. Coincidence (anonymous mail) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the dream merely clarifies what his own work uncovered.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s decoding of her father’s abandonment. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her analysis of grain and rewriting of codes actively narrow options until only one threshold remains. Cost is legible: she forfeits the maze, the terrace, and her former self. The butterfly effect isn’t coincidence but a conceptual constraint shaping tactics—each code maps a ripple she must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging through witnessing the luminous respite—is signaled early and tightens as others join, raising emotional risk. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she invites, initiates the ritual, holds up the feather. The cost is conceptual but felt: years of isolation validated only fleetingly, yet she chooses to share rather than hoard the moment. However, the “tightening” lacks tangible consequence beyond shifted mood; no path is foreclosed, only affirmed. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of communal awe suffices as meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s handling of shard and seed. The meaningful tightening occurs when regret and seed interact, narrowing her understanding from “erased” to “released.” Agency is maintained via conjecture and physical action (pressing seeds, journeying inward). Cost is conceptual but felt: acceptance that some pain must be let go. Coincidence (the bird) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight emerges from Lira’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—imposing order on chaos through art—is signaled early and tightens when Lira deliberately breaks the clown’s loop with discord. Agency is clear: her bow slash forces a collective pause, narrowing options to either retreat or co-create. Cost is felt in the vendor dropping his spoon, the drunk falling silent—small forfeitures that enable the symphony. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of human fragments increases until her music reweights them into unity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—renewing cosmic connection despite the nostalgia ban—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael chooses penning over safety. Escalation is driven by her agency: stealing dust, dancing, writing. Cost is unmistakable: burning pain, trembling garden, fading verse. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density and cadence shift at climax (“stylus gliding… each stroke burned”).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in the mundane—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritual. The tightening occurs when ripples distort the sky’s reflection, forcing her to “read between lines” in real time. Yet pressure remains internal and static; no external force or consequence tests her belief. Cost is conceptual (“before everything shifted”) but not dramatized, limiting escalation to a lyrical deepening rather than a true narrowing of options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into universal language—is signaled early and deepens when the hourglass triggers memory and acceptance. Pressure tightens once: opening the box forces confrontation with frozen time and maternal wisdom, narrowing options from self-flagellation to integration. Cost is felt in Elias’s relinquished narrative of brokenness. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to tip the hourglass—and coincidence never resolves; celestial slowness reflects internal shift, not external convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—puzzling out equations for hope—is signaled early and tightens when the gauge registers fluctuations, proving the grotto’s physics are malleable. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her spiral-weaving forces a deepening that reweights reality itself. Cost is unmistakable: the knowledge that other versions of herself failed, making her perseverance feel earned and fragile. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through increasing pattern complexity until the air “shimmered” with emergent geometry—a decisive cadence shift that narrows possibility into coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the walls’ dreams—is signaled early and deepens into carrying their memory forward. Pressure escalates texturally: from silent vines to groaning stones to the locket’s whisper. The tightening occurs when Lira burns the film, foreclosing archival preservation in favor of embodied transmission. Cost is felt: she sacrifices a relic to become part of the living archive.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show what lies beyond reflection—is signaled early and deepens as each mirror demands more energy. Agency is clear: Lirael chooses to sing despite exhaustion, adapting melody per mirror. Cost escalates visibly (sweating, faltering song) and culminates in bodily depletion. Bells complicate but don’t resolve—she pushes through.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—achieving a fragile peace through flawed compromise—is signaled early and tightens at midday when hostility softens into “weary resignation,” enabling Elara’s decisive guidance. The escalation is driven by her agency: she intervenes with questions, seizes the lull to reflect, and steers the resumed talks. Cost is visible in each signature (“step toward redemption”) and the treaty’s “rough edges.” However, the opposition remains abstract—delegates lack individuated resistance—so pressure feels atmospheric rather than dynamically contested, capping full intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving an echo of lost beauty—is signaled early and tightens when he pours the last river water, a futile act that forecloses real restoration. Pressure escalates texturally: from museum theft to burial ritual to resort construction, each step narrows options while deepening moral ambiguity. The cost is unmistakable—the egg’s dissolution—and driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens. Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the true resolution is internal renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped echoes to defy conformity—is signaled early and deepens via Lirael’s escalating physical exertion. The tightening occurs when threads “glow” and “snap free,” forcing a final, urgent motion that carries stamina cost (“breath came faster”). Agency is clear: only her dance can unlock. Yet the opposition (“lullaby of conformity”) remains abstract, lacking concrete manifestation beyond memory, slightly muting stakes’ visceral urgency despite strong thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can storytelling ethically hold ambiguity?—tightens when the drifter challenges Elias, forcing him to defend half-truths. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he reverses the projection, transforming skepticism into laughter. Cost is conceptual (abandoning moral clarity) and social (risking ridicule), felt in the crowd’s uneasy shift. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure stems from ideological friction within a coherent situational frame.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring transient life—is signaled early and tightens when the monarch’s arrival tests Lirael’s belief in ephemeral signals. Her agency lies in endurance and attention; she forecloses grandeur for humility, with visible cost (physical pain, emotional vulnerability). Escalation is driven by protagonist action (weaving), not coincidence. Slight deduction: the monarch’s role borders on deus ex machina, though its symbolic weight is earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens when the rope shudders, forcing Kael to work faster despite aching back. Agency is clear: his weaving choices directly trigger the aurora vortex. Cost is felt (raw hands, lost voice) but could be sharper—what does he forfeit by succeeding? Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the directive’s truth—is signaled early and tightens when the hologram reframes it as a question, forcing Mara to confront her role as “chosen.” Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to heat the seal, invite chaos, and reinterpret decay. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of old binaries (foresight/hindsight as opposites) and the burden/responsibility of becoming the directive’s architect. The storm’s pressure crystallizes her stance without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and tightens when the tile reveals itself as mirror, forcing Elara to confront self-deception. Agency drives escalation: her choice to align tiles triggers the chamber’s test. Cost is felt in the loss of objective truth (“offered only questions”) but slightly muted by the voice’s expository role. Coincidence avoided; all pressure stems from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching release of resentment—is signaled early and tightens through Lirael’s dwindling cellular extract, forcing meaningful trade-offs (last drop for Kael). Pressure coheres accumulatively: each visitor escalates emotional weight, culminating in Kael’s hardened idealism as the ultimate test. However, the resolution relies on a deus ex machina method (cellular memory liquid) that lacks established constraints; its mechanics solve every conflict identically without adaptation or failure. Cost is conceptual (“resentment will creep back”) but not viscerally felt in Lirael’s body or choices during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens through the reconstruction of the sextant, which shifts from celestial to liminal instrument. Pressure escalates via synchronized breathing and mirror-hanging, narrowing options to a single ritual. Cost is felt: Elias forgoes possession of the dream, and the sextant’s reversal implies irreversible change. Agency is clear, though the stranger’s urgency slightly overshadows Elias’s personal stakes until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keeping the orchard alive as an act of generational faith—is signaled early and deepens when Lira uses “forgotten bag contents” to mend the eye. The tightening occurs in her decision to persist despite abandonment, which forecloses easier paths (leaving, surrender). Cost is felt in the frayed ribbon and rusted tools, though the orchard’s sudden bloom leans slightly toward coincidence. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the board’s warning collides with the shell’s self-portrait, forcing Elara to choose between institutional safety and cosmic belonging. Escalation is driven by her agency: inquiry summons the shell, grotto immersion triggers the library vision, and cameo-pressing enacts inheritance. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts permanent alienation from the museum (“Some truths were meant to be lived, not exhibited”). Coincidence complicates (wind-delivered shell) but resolution stems from her decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—access to erased knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must “renegotiate” by admitting ignorance, foreclosing her prior path of pure erudition. Pressure escalates coherently: from navigating hostile shelves to passing the guardian’s test, each turn narrows options or deepens knowledge. The cost is conceptual but legible: surrendering intellectual pride. Coincidence (Kael’s disappearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency remains Elara’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the garden to reclaim lost names—is signaled early and deepens when the journal reveals it requires “unstitching seams.” Lira’s agency drives escalation: pressing the calliope key, descending stairs, planting their name. Cost is felt in Veyra’s skepticism-turned-participation and the ship’s vanishing. Slight deduction: the garden’s accessibility feels slightly convenient despite thematic preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing lost knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the gear jams, forcing Elara to persist despite danger. Her agency drives escalation: reconfiguring the rope isn’t passive discovery but active alignment of timelines. Cost is felt in bodily risk (“froze,” “chill”) and conceptual weight—she assumes responsibility for preserving frayed realities. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring harmonic balance—is signaled early and deepens when the mapkeeper realizes she must not destroy noise but find quiet within it. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing cracks, pressing the stone, conjuring the bloom mentally. Cost is visceral (aching ribs, ringing ears) and conceptual (accepting that silence requires coexistence, not conquest). The energy beings’ transformation from storm to wind shows stakes were never about removal but recalibration—a nuanced moral calculus earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling meaning in silence—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s physical depletion and storm-night near-failure. Escalation is driven by her agency: sextant adjustments, mosaic alignment, shard insertion. Cost is unmistakable (bleeding fingers, permanent void) and shapes tactics (using retrocognition to feel dead stars). Coincidence (moonlight flicker) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes from earned alignment. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from experience vs. merely archiving—tightens when solid fog makes memory tangible, forcing Lirael to choose participation over observation. Her agency drives escalation: conjecturing fog’s time-warping effect leads to measuring jagged shadows, realizing she’s in dialogue with place. Cost is felt in evaporated rain-memories and the irreversible shift from detached recorder to living thread in the tapestry. Coincidence (sunlight fracturing fog) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her insight comes from active engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through creation—is signaled early and deepens when the mosaic note reframes “shadows” as potential. Pressure escalates causally: the knot’s flare pulls Lira through corridors, muting sound until only her chant remains, forcing reliance on ambient awareness. The climax requires her to risk reigniting trauma by touching flame to lily. Cost is felt in her hitched breath and raw laugh—no off-stage resolutions or static loops.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether connection can survive divergent ways of knowing—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her chronicling must also “bridge gaps between people.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses not to resolve the argument directly but to “plant the seed,” accepting the cost of ambiguity. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though Kael’s agency is passive; escalation hinges almost entirely on Elara’s internal shift rather than mutual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. safety—is signaled early and deepens when the doll is lost, forcing Lila to relinquish her anchor. The gravity-inversion clock creates urgent, narrowing options: she must choose between clinging or returning. Agency is clear: her decision to let go enables the sprout’s emergence. Cost is visible (doll gone) and conceptual (childhood relic sacrificed for new growth), though escalation leans slightly more on atmosphere than active complication.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can silence comfort?—is signaled early and tightens when the vial stills, forcing Elara to abandon her “fluidly logical” method for intuitive listening. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her choice to seek solitude enables the revelation. Cost is felt in the obsolescence of her charts, though the terrace’s anxiety remains untested beyond observation, slightly muting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming the throne to restore balance—is signaled early and deepens into self-realization. Pressure escalates causally: mural reveals narrow options, time tightens tactics, guardian demands truth. Cost is felt in ancestral failures (bones on stairs) and irreversible commitment (stairway collapse). Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves core conflict. Could heighten personal cost beyond legacy (e.g., village sacrifice) for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fading threshold—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes solitude accelerates collapse. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to encroach, risking everything. Cost is felt (emptiness as cage, admission of error) and visible (sanctuary shudders). The tightening—“I can’t hold them alone”—forecloses her prior path of isolation. Under Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory density, not causal turns, which aligns with design.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating existential pressure before implosion—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the diamond chamber. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets texts, touches the bolt, and chooses to turn it despite Voss’s shrug. The cost is clear: if wrong, they die; if right, resilience replaces control. Coincidence (texts) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the bolt’s function is activated by her choice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when letters reveal the dynasty’s self-erasure was protective. Pressure escalates causally: each crank turn heightens sensory intensity until the standing waves trigger vision and action. The cost is felt (emotional collapse, inherited burden) and shapes Lirael’s final stance. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping stasis by capturing possibility—is signaled early and deepens when “capture” transforms into “live.” The single meaningful tightening occurs at the marionette: unsnapping strings forces a trade-off (preservation vs. liberation) with visible cost (greenhouse destruction). Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—each sensory intensification (violet flares, gear screams) narrows emotional options until descent becomes inevitable. Luck never resolves; agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and deepens when the button’s date reframes the boy’s origin. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias shifts from passive cataloging to active storytelling, narrowing his path from observer to witness. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability, confrontation with systemic silence) and shapes the final image. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal rather than externally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—exposing erased histories—is signaled early and tightens when drones force underwater escape. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the tunnel, inserts the key, orders playback. Cost is unmistakable: near-capture, explosion, loss of the physical archive. Under causal lens, each turn stems from her decisions, not luck. Coincidence (drones retreating post-explosion) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the thumb drive already secured.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing the prophecy before it completes—is signaled early and escalates causally: dream → confrontation → dissolution. Elias’s agency drives escalation; his playing intensifies as the figure speaks, narrowing options to pure sonic resistance. The cost (physical strain, psychological burden) is unmistakable in “lungs burning” and “shoulders slumping.” Coincidence never resolves; victory is earned through sustained effort under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaves—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone speck appears, narrowing options to ritual action. Escalation is driven by Elinor’s agency (the prod, monument-building), not coincidence, and yields concrete costs: urgency to harvest, warn, and seek Lirael. However, the storm threat remains abstract—no personal loss or tactical sacrifice is dramatized, softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes “ashes” are metaphorical. The tightening occurs at the greenhouse collapse: his literal dig becomes a plunge into chaos, forcing improvisation. Cost is legible—he nearly drowns, accepts imperfection—but the resolution leans slightly passive; the compass is found via accident (current drags him), though his choice to keep it imperfect is active. Under Accumulative lens, this suffices: pressure crystallizes stance without requiring causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding the weight of names—is signaled early and tightens when Kael drops the coin, trading physical proof for spectral truth. The escalation is driven by Kael’s agency: his choice to activate the coin deepens knowledge and forecloses recovery of Lira’s body. Cost is felt in the silence after her fade and the extinguished light. Under an Accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies via pattern (names → coin → kintsugi → redemption), though the “shed name” concept risks abstraction without grounding in world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—integrating laughter into healing—is signaled early and deepens when Lira admits her fear that joy alone is insufficient. The tightening occurs in dialogue: the spirit reframes truth as the crocodile’s tooth, forcing Lira to choose vulnerability over technique. Cost is felt (emotional risk) and visible (offering the relic). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—measuring the unmeasurable weight of survival—is signaled early and deepens when the woman declares mercy “a choice,” forcing Elias to confront agency over calculation. The tightening occurs when spores settle as “ultraviolet penance,” transforming environmental pressure into moral calculus. Cost is visible: the strap’s bite, the burning skin, the surrender of certainty. Though coincidence introduces the woman, she complicates rather than resolves, and Elias’s final step forward is earned through endurance, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving an intuition anchor to mend fractured history—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s embodied discovery process. Pressure escalates via perceptual intensification (ink-induced vision), narrowing options to intuitive alignment. Cost is felt in the weight of reclaimed memory and the moral burden of giving a drowned world “a second chance.” Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—acknowledging trapped grief—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to analyze dust over merely fixing machinery. His agency drives escalation: climbing, brushing, listening, breaking plaster. The cost is conceptual (bearing witness) and subtly physical (shaking legs), legible in the final image. Yet the pressure remains largely internal; external obstacles are minimal, and the ghosts’ guidance verges on convenient. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of pattern-to-meaning earns the score.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—stabilizing vs. awakening fractured minds—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses rupture over preservation. Escalation is driven by her agency: aligning press rhythm with frost dissolution amplifies the whisper. Cost is unmistakable: the bottled whisper shatters, clouds churn, and the library’s order collapses. Under the Accumulative lens, this density increase reweights the entire premise without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating erased history against institutional myth—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s absurd method yields tangible proof. Escalation is driven by his agency: draping mirrors triggers the storm vision, which informs fungal planting, which forces public confrontation. Cost is visible (excommunication, risk of sabotage accusations) and conceptual (truth destabilizes collective identity). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions or static loops.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light through truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias declares the ailment “moral.” Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Lira’s admission triggers the stone’s flare, narrowing options from concealment to exposure. Cost is felt (“left me to face the debts alone”) and reweights the final melody as “truth,” not lullaby. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, though a second tactical constraint (e.g., time pressure) could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding “the place where explanations fail”—is signaled early and deepens when the compass locks direction. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow erratic guidance, wade into silt, and touch the carved initials. The tightening occurs when the compass vibrates violently, forcing her to confront the lagoon’s indifference. Cost is felt in her trembling departure and the irreversible expansion of her worldview; human logic no longer suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reimagining fractured history into coherence—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern slide reveals layered pasts. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the slide, step through, and ask to be taught. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: she surrenders the role of mere artist for eternal weaver, bearing generational memory. Coincidence (finding the slide) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice crystallizes the alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “map to the hush”—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s agency: she chooses to trace patterns at dawn/dusk, repaints shadows, cross-references postcards. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons restoring frescoes to paint “the space around” the jasmine—a renunciation that reorients her art and understanding. Cost is felt: years of fixation, emotional isolation, and the unresolved final layer. Coincidence (Sister Agatha’s lore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias Thorn’s buried sketches remain inaccessible, preserving struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased resistance history—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the lagoon (“stay past sunset, and you’ll stay forever”). Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses debris language, decodes symbols, triggers trapdoor. Cost is unmistakable: identity erosion, near-death vision, blanked diary. Antagonist’s reveal complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory is tactical delay, not total win.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving a civilization through memory—is signaled early and deepens as Elias shifts from despair to active reconstruction. Escalation occurs via Accumulative pressure: each artifact tightens his resolve, culminating in the bottle’s transformation from barrier to lens. The cost is unmistakable: he bears the emotional weight of collective forgetting alone, and revival demands total psychic investment. Agency is clear—his working memory *is* the method—and luck never resolves tension; the cove awakens only because he refuses to stop remembering.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—deciphering whether the prophecy heralds disaster or awakening—is signaled early and deepens when Voss hears the harmonic hum beneath the shriek. His agency lies in choosing to listen rather than intervene, a renunciation that forecloses control but affirms his life’s work. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: he must archive a truth he cannot act upon. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens, and the foghorn’s silence tightens the temporal window without artificial ticking clocks.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reopening the path by decreasing entropy—is signaled early and deepens via paradox: introducing disorder (seeds) to reduce entropy. Lirael’s agency drives escalation; her choice to scatter heirloom beans narrows options (sacrificing generational care for potential renewal). Cost is unmistakable: the seeds must die to feed the vortex, and the atrium’s stability hangs in balance until the sapling emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving solstice balance—is signaled early and tightens when the bell’s wrong tone agitates storms, forcing Lira to choose between noise and listening. Her switch escalates pressure by summoning chaos, then deepens it through rhythmic modulation that restores calm. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and conceptual shift: she moves from observer to conductor. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens when the fractured star demands active pursuit, not passive observation. Zara’s agency drives escalation: she walks, kneels, places the lantern, listens. The cost is conceptual (missed report, potential dismissal) but made tangible in Veyra’s presence and the dimmed lantern. Coincidence (the star fracturing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from Zara’s choice to interpret, not track. Tightening is meaningful but could heighten physical or social risk slightly more.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens when the box glows and ghosts solidify. The meaningful tightening occurs at the climax: *Speak* compels Elias to choose between lifelong silence and release. Cost is visible—he relinquishes his identity as preserver—and ghosts fade as consequence. Yet escalation relies on external revelation (the message in glass) rather than protagonist agency intensifying pressure; the deepening is handed to him, weakening causal ownership under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when clocks flicker and only silo shadows hold still. The meaningful intensification occurs when Elias embeds poetic messages, transforming passive observation into active ritual. This act narrows his options: he must engage emotionally, not numerically. Cost is felt in the urn fragment’s vibration and the irreversible vision of his wife—grief made generative, not just endured.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing discord through fragile creation—is signaled early and deepens when the snapped kite string mirrors her “unraveled thoughts.” Agency lies in her choice to *tend* rather than abandon, foreclosing permanence (the tapestry dissolves) for transient meaning. Cost is felt conceptually: her art is ephemeral, acknowledged only by a passing fisherman. Yet escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than narrowing options; the pressure remains lyrical rather than causally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (interspecies harmony) tightens coherently: the orchard’s fraying energy escalates to a ground-shaking rumble, forcing Lira’s climactic wire-wrap. Agency drives escalation—her systematic choices narrow options (e.g., selecting specific branches) under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: her terminal timeline visibly shapes urgency (“Almost there”), and the spirit’s admission “It hurts” confirms irreversible emotional price paid for unity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—can belonging be engineered?—tightens when Kael reveals the Enclave’s method is incomplete, forcing Lirael to choose between exposure and understanding. Her agency drives the climax: placing the amber isn’t passive reception but active surrender to ambiguity. The cost is emotional (resurfaced longing) and intellectual (skepticism undone), legible in her “breaking glass” laugh. Coincidence (dusty footprints) complicates but doesn’t resolve; convergence is earned through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming life from ecological ruin—is signaled early and tightens when bird calls shift from guidance (“flicker’s trill told him to dig deeper”) to emotional plea (“dialect of loss”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: he interprets, chooses, acts. Cost is felt: barren soil, skeletal reef, personal history of war. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices—the tern’s cry delivering “Khalis” reweights the entire effort as sacred interval rather than mere gardening.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—forging closeness from fragmented history—is signaled early and deepens through each riddle. Hush’s agency drives escalation: she identifies the leaf as key, barks to prompt retrieval, and deciphers “memory” and “love.” Cost is felt in the elders’ murmurs and children’s mimicry—social transformation with implied vulnerability. Yet the stakes lack tangible risk; no consequence threatens failure, softening tension despite lyrical payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—ethical clarity amid temporal disorientation—is signaled early and deepens when the “glimpse” extends into a vision of his grandmother, forcing Elio to confront his foundational confusion. The tightening occurs in his choice to move despite uncertainty, foreclosing paralysis. Cost is felt in the smudged sketch and abandoned stasis, though the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (reactor spasm triggering the vision). Still, agency drives the resolution: he chooses, trusts, steps forward.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—amending cosmic imbalance before Aetheria falls—is signaled early and escalates causally: each swap risks greater instability, narrowing Kael’s margin for error. Agency is clear: he chooses speed over caution, accepting tremors and whines as costs that shape his frantic pace. The tightening from pawn to king forecloses safe options, culminating in a high-stakes final act where failure means annihilation. Cost is legible in the darkening sky and violent shaking, paid off when harmony returns—but the story avoids showing a personal sacrifice, slightly muting the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—becoming historian of small gestures—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she *is* the pawn. Escalation is driven by her agency: walking, then reversing the pattern, which triggers the board’s response. Cost is unmistakable: enduring the gallery’s psychic pressure, risking dissolution into silence. The interregnum tightens stakes (curators returning), but the real pressure is internal—her refusal to let ghosts dictate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding home through memory—is signaled early and deepens when Lirael chooses to seed the stone, narrowing her path from avoidance to acceptance. The escalation is driven by her agency: retrieving the feather, pressing it to the stone, whispering her truth. Cost is unmistakable—the stone shatters, pain lances through her, and she permanently bears others’ memories. Coincidence never resolves; Orin’s role is reactive, not causal. One tightening suffices, and it forecloses forgetting as an option.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and deepens when memory reveals his arrogance. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: plucking the black thread triggers the pivotal memory, forcing him to confront betrayal. Cost is unmistakable—he relinquishes the belief he alone could’ve saved the prince, accepting systemic corruption. Thunder’s lull acts as a subtle temporal constraint, though its escalation doesn’t materially alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth as collective refraction vs. elders’ monopolized lie—is signaled early and tightens when Kael paints “Forgive,” directly challenging the ritual. His agency drives escalation: poetry sessions seed dissent, the vial-smuggling enables the act, and his recitation crystallizes the turning point. Cost is unmistakable: he knowingly trades safety for revelation, and the elders’ scream confirms real consequence. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the moral calculus (forgiveness as weapon) sharpens the peak choice without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and deepens via Lira’s tactile engagement with the charm. Agency drives escalation: her narration alters reality (“scars shifted into constellations”). Cost is unmistakable—lung-burning fumes, emotional exposure—and culminates in a stance crystallization that forecloses her old self. Pressure tightens organically under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling impermanence with artistic purpose—is signaled early via the cracked mirror and “temporary eternity.” Pressure tightens when Elias chooses the cave over routine, then deepens at the pool where past/present converge. His agency drives escalation: the wrong turn, placing the shell, tearing paper to draw anew. Cost is visible in his lifelong avoidance and the risk of confronting maternal memory—but the caves’ danger feels slightly abstracted, limiting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and deepens when Thalos validates her grandmother’s lore, raising emotional stakes. Pressure tightens when the lantern flickers and Thalos interrupts, forcing Elara to choose between concealment and trust. Her hum merges with garden and sea, narrowing options to vulnerability alone. Cost is unmistakable: exposure risks ridicule but yields communal warmth, crystallizing her stance without shouting.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost routes through reverse migration—is signaled early and deepens via the phone’s escalating instructions. Pressure tightens causally: each midnight call forces a new material sacrifice (hair, circuit boards) and technical adjustment. The moon-phase constraint creates real tradeoffs (working under specific lunar conditions). Agency is clear—Mara chooses to obey, to build—and cost is felt in physical exhaustion and emotional vulnerability, though the ghostly resolution leans slightly on lyric grace over concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety in a post-virus world—is signaled early and tightens when Jorn reveals the ledger, forcing Mara to escalate from cultivation to confrontation. The meaningful deepening occurs when she inserts the eye, trading personal safety for unfiltered truth. Cost is legible: exposure to dangerous knowledge, alliance with a paranoid man, and abandonment of passive truffle trade for active resistance. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the captain’s guilt reframes the Aurora’s sinking as deliberate betrayal. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to “show me,” kneels at the trunk, and commits to restoration. The cost is felt in the woman’s sob and Elias’s burdened heart, charging the final image. Though coincidence delivers the boutonnière, it complicates rather than resolves; all key turns stem from character decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping stagnation via the “doorway of decisions”—is signaled early and deepens when the chip reveals it’s a mirror, not an exit. Pressure escalates coherently: creek rise forces timing, ants confirm path, vision crystallizes cost (confronting loss). Agency is clear—Lila chooses to touch the chip and step through—but the “empirically intuitive” concept resolves too neatly without tangible tradeoff (e.g., physical toll or irreversible choice). Still, the tightening forecloses her old self with felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting emotional paralysis—is signaled early and tightens when the figure reframes dreams as solution, not problem. The queen’s agency drives escalation: her climb initiates contact, her defiance (“nonsense”) provokes deeper revelation, and her silent retreat crystallizes stance. Cost is legible in the final image—starlight-glistening hands mark irreversible awareness—but the seer’s warning lacks tactical consequence, slightly softening initial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the nexus to save the city—is signaled early and tightens when Jorin reveals the ledger, forcing Elara to abandon force for receptivity. The deepening (“palette of resolve”) narrows options: she must relinquish control or fail again. Cost is felt in past explosions and present urgency (“city above grew colder”). Agency drives escalation—her choice to “return differently” directly enables the climax, with no coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling fractured identity—is signaled early and deepens when the scroll demands ritual action. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to climb despite his limp, enters the crevice, and engages the blank scroll. The cost—abandoning envy of past selves—is felt in the bittersweet clarity of the ending. One tightening suffices at this length, though the “accident” backstory slightly dilutes immediacy of present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden emotional truths through occluded views—is signaled early and deepens when Lira deciphers the engraving. The meaningful tightening occurs when she connects “E” to Eleanor via the photo, foreclosing ignorance and forcing her to act. Cost is felt: Lira risks misinterpretation by naming the secret, yet the resolution hinges on her agency, not coincidence. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming shame into power—is signaled early and deepens when ink crystallizes, forcing Kael to choose between control and surrender. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he whispers a childhood rhyme, scrapes the sigil, sheds doubt. Cost is unmistakable: scars don’t vanish but become legible symbols, a permanent reconfiguration. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and symbolic density rather than causal reversals, which fits design.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with a lost sibling through unfinished art—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reveals his guilt. Clara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets the bottle as a conduit, upends it, and commands Elias to finish the song. The cost is felt in the irreversible emptying of the bottle and the orchard’s destruction, which crystallizes the theme of imperfect resolution. One tightening suffices, but it’s potent and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early and deepens through the spiral arbitration concept, but escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than protagonist-driven narrowing of options. The key tightening occurs when the Witness closes their eyes and confronts inner chaos, foreclosing reliance on external texts—a credible renunciation with conceptual cost. However, the “universe’s hiccup” exerts no tangible pressure on tactics, weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and deepens through Lorn’s counting ritual, which tightens focus until reality fractures. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance rather than action, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual but felt: Lorn gains painful clarity about time’s emotional weight, foreclosing naive belief. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (continuing the count despite unease), though the fjord’s response borders on coincidence; still, it serves the thematic turn without resolving external conflict mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revolutionizing barriers through surrender—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes they’re “filters” of intent. Pressure escalates causally: flickering barriers → dying column → system’s fear, each narrowing options until Kael must choose trust over analysis. Cost is felt (his identity as a controller) but not fully dramatized in action; the climax leans slightly conceptual. Still, the tightening forecloses his old methodology with visible consequence (cooling laser = surrendered tool).

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling theoretical rebellion with lived grief—is signaled early and tightens when Clara chooses left at the fork, foreclosing passive observation for active traversal. Agency is clear: she interprets, chooses, endures. Cost is felt in emotional exposure (“tears mixing with rain”) and the irreversible shift from spectator to participant. Coincidence (scrawls) complicates but doesn’t resolve; escalation stems from Clara’s own pattern-seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming disconnection into connection—is signaled early and deepens through accumulating calls. Pressure escalates texturally: each interaction raises emotional intensity (grief → child’s sobs → suicide risk), narrowing Mara’s margin for error. Agency lies in her active “looping,” which forecloses passive operator duty at a cost of sustained emotional labor. However, the clown/orange distraction risks tonal dissonance, slightly muddying stakes coherence; coincidence (random payphone child) complicates but doesn’t resolve, staying within lens bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the covenant through proximate causes—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s realization that “legend felt hollow without the photo’s humanity.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses ink over ritual sacrifice, foreclosing magical solutions in favor of human-scale attention. Cost is felt in the thinning magic and ancestral loss, though the escalation leans more thematic than tactical. Agency is clear but constrained by the story’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reframes loneliness as “a language.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to offer the rock despite skepticism, and his swallowed joke shows tactical restraint under pressure. The cost is conceptual (abandoning the cure-as-transaction mindset) and emotional (confronting his own isolation). Coincidence doesn’t resolve—the ghost’s appearance stems directly from their ritual, and the “polite anarchy” method shapes their defiance of literal-minded solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reaching the stillpoint to reconcile grief—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s agency: he chooses left at moss, wades into electric river, digs at its command. The celestial pause imposes a live clock; failure means losing the melody forever. Cost is felt in physical strain and emotional risk. Coincidence complicates (frequencies shift), but resolution stems from Elias’s persistent choice to follow vibration over sight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing the timeline without further harm—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lira reveals editing requires collaboration, not control. The deepening (“history resents being pruned”) raises conceptual cost: Elias must endure the vulnerability of truth-telling. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; Lira guides but doesn’t solve. Coincidence never resolves—only Elias’s choice to apologize and listen alters the outcome, with the girl’s fever breaking as tangible proof of earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music to combat communal forgetfulness—is signaled early and deepens when Lira joins, raising emotional stakes. Kael’s agency drives escalation: his signing quickens the waves, draws the crowd, and forces collective participation. The cost is legible in his post-climax sadness, acknowledging impermanence. Yet the tightening isn’t decisive—no live option is foreclosed; the fisherman’s request resets rather than transforms pressure, softening the escalation’s edge just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing buried truth through artistic translation—is signaled early and tightens through each room-to-room creation, culminating in the chamber where healing replaces defacement. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mara chooses increasingly intimate interventions (symbols → shifting constellations → dialect phrases → the tear), each narrowing her path toward revelation. Cost is felt in her solitude and the irreversible alteration of artifacts; the final image crystallizes stakes without resolving them neatly. Escalation is driven by choice, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether entangled memories are a burden or a gift—tightens when the second character appears and reframes remembrance as active stewardship. Eli’s agency drives escalation: his drumming summons resonance, transforming passive sorrow into shared rhythm. Cost is felt in his scarred body and emotional exposure. The shift from numbness to participation is earned, though the second character’s arrival leans slightly toward convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—proving silence’s power—is signaled early and escalates through the storm’s intensification and Voss’s challenge. The tightening occurs at the Libra junction: shouting reveals position (as shown with the lost hauler), while whispering/humming unlocks paths. Elias’s agency drives escalation—he chooses silence repeatedly, narrowing his tactical options until only humming remains. Cost is felt: he endures isolation and risk to validate his theory, and the labyrinth’s response confirms his stance has real consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars—is signaled early and deepened through Lira’s precise manipulation of light. Pressure escalates texturally: stillwater tension softens only after her intervention, proving causality through environmental response. Cost is felt in her solitude and cyclical labor (“the darkness would always return, and so would she”), foreclosing permanence. Though no antagonist appears, the canal’s “unspoken ache” serves as coherent opposition, resolved not by victory but attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative rebellion—is signaled early and tightens through Clara’s window displays and Lila’s arrival. The meaningful deepening occurs when Clara reveals Lila’s father’s history, narrowing options: now the game isn’t abstract but ancestral. Cost is felt in Lila’s stiffened posture, Clara’s withheld tears—emotional prices that alter tactics (e.g., Clara choosing vulnerability over distance). Though coincidence introduces Lila, agency drives escalation: Clara’s choice to disclose, Lila’s decision to return tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. rootedness—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Lira releases the scrimshaw, foreclosing return. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she chooses to follow the whale, then to detach. Cost is visible (island vanishes, past self “gone”), though the violence mentioned upfront never concretely shapes tactics—it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resisting grief-erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Lirael’s ritual. Pressure escalates texturally: each whittling step (“find the grain,” “shape the bowl”) becomes a quiet act of rebellion with cumulative cost (petals disintegrate, night falls). The tightening occurs in her realization that polishing is “an act of defiance.” No false resolution; the mandate remains, but her endurance reconfigures meaning. Agency is subtle but present—she chooses remembrance through craft.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolving sacred/profane boundaries—is signaled early and deepens through Lirael’s escalating paraphrasing, which physically alters the environment. Agency is clear: her voice triggers the lake’s thaw and colonnade’s transformation. Cost is felt (“weight that pressed into her ribs”) and culminates in irreversible world-shaping, though the price remains conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification: stone rippling like water beneath her touch.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens when the reed tongue awakens plant communication, forcing Elias to choose between his grayscale purity and Marla’s magical pigment. The tightening occurs when the mural reveals Marla’s culpability, raising moral stakes: art now carries historical weight. Elias’s agency drives escalation—he presses the keys, mixes the dust—and pays a conceptual price: his worldview shatters before rebuilding. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from prior choice or established magic.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering connection’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes the cave itself is an instrument, narrowing options from mechanical replication to receptive listening. Agency is clear: her questioning (“Why do we assume sound is intangible?”) directly triggers the hologram and cave resonance. Cost is felt in the pilgrimage’s physical risk and the lab’s paradigm collapse, though the external world’s instability (“grid’s collapse”) slightly underutilized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into mending—is signaled early and tightens when stencil shadows shift into “hands” and “eyes,” proving intentions are shared. Elias’s agency drives escalation: folding cranes, lighting lanterns, tracing until he bleeds. Cost is felt in his hollowed past and the global coordinates of loss. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his labor earns the “subdued ardor” at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns post-collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Mara’s despair forces Elara to prove utility beyond abstraction. The tightening occurs when Elara shifts from passive reading (“cards showed patterns”) to active teaching (“lay cards where raindrops fall”), foreclosing isolation for collaboration. Cost is felt in Mara’s “frayed” voice and Elara’s rewound tape—a small exhaustion that scales to societal rebuilding. Coincidence (the knock) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Elara’s choice to confide, narrowing her path from observer to guide.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing dangerous truth without succumbing to patterned thinking—is signaled early and deepens when the pagoda’s energy activates. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: her touch triggers the glow, her interpretation reframes the past as choice. Cost is legible—Kael’s recoil, her isolation, the irreversible shedding of innocence. The tightening occurs when she chooses to embrace “anguished joy” over safety, foreclosing retreat into approved narratives.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—is signaled early and tightens when Thalos warns the shadow is “fragile.” Lirael’s agency drives escalation: her decision to compare footage (not alert council) narrows options, forcing reliance on archival evidence. Cost is unmistakable: one misstep destroys hope. The deepening—from glitch to metamorphosis—alters knowledge and tactics, though the external pressure (shadow’s hunger) slightly lacks adaptive resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—balancing compassion and self-respect—is signaled early and deepens when Lira confronts the cost of her gentleness. The tightening occurs when she chooses to reconstruct the tail, thereby rejecting the con’s verdict on kindness. Cost is felt in her shed layers (guilt, fear) and visible in the fragile adhesive bond. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves conflict. Slightly abstract phrasing (“moral compass”) dilutes visceral immediacy at one key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the story in her scar—is signaled early and tightens through each coffee-ring descent, foreclosing denial and forcing confrontation with grief. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to touch, descend, and examine, each act narrowing emotional escape routes. Cost is unmistakable—the scar burns, tears fall, breath fogs—as past trauma becomes present pressure. The plants’ whispers complicate but never resolve; insight emerges solely through Mara’s endurance and attention.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost love’s residue—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the letters were never sent, foreclosing reconciliation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her second psychometric attempt forces confrontation with Elise’s choice to hide rather than communicate. Cost is felt in Mara’s throat tightening and crumpled fist—a physical manifestation of inherited grief. The war’s offstage role complicates but doesn’t resolve; Thomas’s absence remains a wound Mara inherits, not solves.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—is signaled early and deepens when the sextant reveals memory-laden stardust. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he aligns the instrument, traces the star, spills the dust. The cost is conceptual but legible: years of unrealized art crystallize into one charged moment of reception. Luck (aurora’s timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the hidden chamber responds only to his precise action. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length, though the stakes remain largely internal without tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks in a dreamless world—is signaled early and tightens when the woman reveals the forest fire stole imagination itself. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to fix the clock, becoming “occasionally everywhere,” which collapses the wave function. Cost is legible: his lifelong dreamlessness ends, but the burden of cultivation now rests on him (coat of light donned). Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems from environmental decay and archival fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the forest’s hum to access primordial chaos—is signaled early and tightens when the gear fits the socket, forcing Elara to choose between possession and propagation. The deepening (“forest is a brain”) narrows options: she must let go. Cost is felt in the gear’s departure and the quieting hum, though escalation leans more on revelation than pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindling unused courage—is signaled early and deepens through encounters with travelers. The meaningful tightening occurs when Jorin internalizes that courage is shared, not hoarded, altering his stance. Agency is present: choices to stamp tickets, follow paths, and return “through indirect routes” narrow options with emotional cost. Coincidence never resolves; the leash break sets conditions, but human action drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—safety vs. silence—is signaled early and deepens when Lady Veyra’s scream ruptures the fortress’s equilibrium. Elric’s agency drives escalation: his neglect causes crisis, his discovery on the staircase informs response, his speech resolves it. Cost is felt in healer exhaustion and dimmed walls, and the final trade—voice for true safety—is unmistakable. Coincidence (stain on step) is minor and plausibly seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and tightens at the Convergence, when failure means eternal falsehood. Veyra’s agency drives escalation: deciphering messages, navigating shadows, activating the rune. Cost is legible: eons of solitude, risk of exposure, and the burden of sole truth-bearer. The pretender’s hollow form crystallizes the moral calculus—truth over stability—and the courtiers’ shift validates stakes without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens when Kael dismisses her findings, raising emotional and professional cost. The fossil fuel ban reframes expectations: healing should occur, yet reality fractures instead. Lira’s agency drives escalation (cross-referencing data, interpreting dreams), culminating in a choice that trades safety for mystery. Cost is felt in the abandoned station and implied risk, though physical stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reigniting meaning amid collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Lira ties the stones’ hum to cosmic alignment. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her interpretation forces Jax’s pivot and draws the crowd. Cost is unmistakable—the rebels’ prior drift, Lira’s isolation—and the tightening (silence → roar) forecloses despair without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition without surrendering it—is signaled early and tightens when the plants demand urgency (“Before the drones return”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she decodes, digs, chooses planting over control. Cost is felt in physical pain and social risk. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the spiral-lock turn narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—anchoring peace amid chaos—is signaled early and deepens when wind triggers flashback. Lila’s agency drives escalation: she actively uses somatic markers instead of passively enduring. Cost is felt in her continued tremors and the irreversible loss of Elias. One tightening suffices: the flashback moment forces her to choose between collapse or anchoring, narrowing her options to embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning in a fragmented world—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from passive collector to active weaver. The tightening occurs at “redesigned his approach,” where he weaponizes fragmentation itself. Cost is felt: he descends into darkness, relinquishing old methods. Though escalation is driven by interior realization rather than external pressure, it aligns coherently with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering her brother from temporal erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes time fragments rather than slows, reframing her quest. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to use the ink, interprets the child’s drawing, and enters the tower. The cost is felt in what’s lost (certainty, safety) and what’s risked (herself). However, the elders’ warning and the child’s insight verge on convenient revelation rather than hard-won discovery, slightly softening the pressure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. censorship—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael chooses interference over observation. The cost (betrayal of her role, Council retaliation) is felt but not yet enacted. Escalation is driven by her agency, yet the pressure remains abstract; we’re told the Council will come, but their absence flattens immediate consequence. One meaningful deepening suffices, but high-band requires sharper tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“to weave continuity through chaos”—is signaled early and deepens when Lira interprets “quiet” not as suppression but as focus, narrowing her path to nonviolent stewardship. Agency is expressed through renunciation (never firing a gun) and attention (humming, planting), with clear cost: she bears the weight of her father’s penance alone. Escalation occurs via density increase—sand mixing with soil, memory with present labor—not causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. The howling sandstorm outside versus stillness within crystallizes pressure without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the goddess’s echo to understand the sleepwalking constellations—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the echo is a frequency “hidden in the gaps between notes.” His agency drives escalation: two strikes of the spike narrow options, culminating in the goddess’s dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: her absence stills the sky but erases her presence. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from Kael’s choices under coherent world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reckoning with inherited corruption—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Clara finds her father’s handwritten order. This forecloses innocence and forces higher-stakes action (dossier, testimony). Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency under a causal lens; each document cross-reference narrows options. Cost is unmistakable: severed family ties, public vilification (“reckless”), yet she persists. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hushing dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes the firmware erases baby cries, linking to her personal trauma. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the firmware, confronts the nursery, and reads the letter. The cost is felt: enduring emotional retraumatization to achieve resolution. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the scientists’ guilt is confronted, not circumvented. One meaningful deepening suffices, though secondary stakes (lab survival) remain underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding the grotto’s message—is signaled early and tightens when the tile pulses urgently, forcing Mara to choose between preservation and intervention. Her agency drives escalation: drawing the mandala *causes* increased clarity, and placing the tile *triggers* the hum and silence. Cost is conceptual (solitary documentation fails; meaning requires participation), legible in the final realization. Minor deduction: the “interject” directive emerges abruptly, slightly weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning from erasure—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s retrocognitive toggling between past vibrancy and present ruin. His agency crystallizes in the act of placement, which forecloses passive mourning in favor of symbolic rebirth. Cost is conceptual (acceptance that he cannot undo fire) and felt (resignation beneath hope). Escalation is subtle but sufficient: memory → recognition → action. No external antagonist needed; pressure arises from internalized historical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and escalates via Elias’s echo production, which narrows options: each summoned spirit risks destabilizing the timeline further. Agency drives escalation; his humming crescendo forces the garden’s response, culminating in the maze dissolving. Cost is unmistakable: mending fractures requires Elias’s own dissolution at dawn. The Wheel of Fortune reversed crystallizes the thematic trade-off—possibility demands surrender, not control.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—authentic awareness vs. engineered telepathy—is signaled early and tightens when Elias rejects the recall’s “distraction.” The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the shock left “breadcrumbs,” shifting from victim to cartographer. Cost is felt: tingling wrist, emotional labor of mapping, risk of failure (“if it doesn’t work?”). Agency drives escalation—Elias’s focus, sketching, meditation—not coincidence. The leaked memo raises conceptual stakes but doesn’t muddy the core pressure: self-trust versus corporate surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unknown—is signaled early and tightens when the fossil floats, forcing Lira to choose immersion over observation. Her agency drives escalation: activating the mapper, coating her skin, touching the fossil. Cost is felt in the fossil’s crumbling and her irreversible absorption of its memory. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density rather than external opposition, which fits the story’s introspective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking buried truth to reshape prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes buttons are mnemonic anchors. Her agency drives escalation: sorting isn’t passive but a method that coaxes the jar’s secret into coherence. Cost is legible: time passes (hourglass), silence intensifies, and the weight of history becomes palpable. While pressure remains internal and atmospheric, it coheres under the Accumulative lens; however, the absence of external opposition slightly limits tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming courage to honor her father—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses to inscribe the code into the earth, accepting its erasure by rain. This act narrows options: she cannot retrieve it later; she must move forward blind. Pressure escalates not through external threat but internal resistance (“paranoia had kept her alive”), and the tightening comes via her decision to trust the process. Cost is felt: emotional vulnerability replaces operational safety, and the spiral symbol’s completion marks irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring the palimpsest promise through silent attentiveness—is signaled early and deepens via ambient pressure (thickening fog, approaching rain). The single tightening occurs when the ferry arrives: Thaddeus must trust the ritual over words, foreclosing verbal negotiation. Cost is conceptual (hours of waiting, emotional labor of silence) but legible in the needle’s warmth and the gutters’ eventual tick. Agency resides in endurance, not action, which fits the Situational/Accumulative hybrid—but the escalation lacks a tangible trade-off beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why kindness persists—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she herself planted the hope-anchor decades prior. The tightening occurs at the sunflowers: their unnatural survival forces a confrontation with personal history, narrowing options to acceptance or denial. Cost is felt in the renunciation of other timelines (fortress, erasure), though the escalation leans slightly on revelation over active choice. Agency emerges in her decision to carry the lesson eastward.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keeping beauty alive in darkness—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to approach Mara again despite past silence. The tightening occurs in his decision to offer the gauge not as tool but as talisman for “measuring light,” narrowing his tactic from passive giving (geranium) to active co-creation (rhythm, humming). Cost is felt: his vulnerability in knocking, her risk in opening the door. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens—each sensory and rhythmic layer raises emotional stakes without coincidence or reset.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial’s visions force a confrontation with ancestral identity. The tightening occurs at “I see you. But I am not you,” which forecloses passive communion and demands active authorship. Cost is felt: she relinquishes the comfort of kinship for solitary creation. While escalation is driven by environmental pressure (the hum), Lirael’s agency crystallizes in her choice to write, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements. Minor deduction: the stone circle’s mechanics remain slightly abstract, reducing tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—rejoining connection through truth—tightens meaningfully when Lila chooses to write and release her secret, foreclosing her old method of ghostwriting concealment. The public art installation deepens pressure by making secrecy communal and transient. However, escalation relies partly on Elara’s intervention rather than purely protagonist-driven agency; the “Keeper’s Spiral” functions more as prompt than earned catalyst. Cost is felt (tears, trembling) but not concretely paid beyond emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth amid cosmic chaos—is signaled early and tightens when funding is threatened. Lila’s interference narrows options: she risks retaliation to restore harmony. The deepening occurs when subsonic frequencies succeed but provoke a new warning, raising the conceptual price of vigilance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt in lingering division and the haunting voice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the space-bending key—is clear from the outset and tightens when the cathedral itself becomes antagonistic (“spatial mutiny”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to lunge despite fear, then uses the compass as a weapon. Cost is felt in recurring claustrophobia and the organ’s dirge-like pressure. Though the organ’s sentience borders on coincidence, it complicates rather than resolves, and Elias’s final act remains his own.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving empathy in a dead case—is signaled early and deepens when the ribbon leads to physical evidence. Clara’s agency drives escalation: she insists on being there, initiates sketching, hands Voss charcoal. Cost is visible in Voss’s weariness and Clara’s emotional exposure, though the quarry’s instability remains underutilized as active threat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification (handprint → locket).

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reversing ancestral exile—is signaled early and tightens when the jet stream shifts, forcing Clara to choose between evacuation and ritual. Her agency drives escalation: decoding stanzas, digging, reading aloud. The cost—potential disaster, defying authority—is unmistakable in the sickly green sky and howling wind. Yet the “reversal” mechanism leans slightly on coincidence (shipwreck codex conveniently buried), slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—accessing “pixelated amnesty” to rewrite lost possibilities—is signaled early and deepens when the flake reveals itself as a map. Elias’s agency drives escalation: tuning the fiddle, playing faster, interpreting scaffold flutters as code. Cost is conceptual (confronting “ashes of never”) and felt in the luminous disbelief of displacement. Yet the tightening lacks a concrete trade-off; no resource, time, or relationship is visibly forfeited, softening the price paid under Accumulative lens standards.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escaping cyclical greed—is signaled early and tightened through Elias’s subtle campaign, which narrows his own options (no violence, no direct contact). The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes paths circle due to choices, not fate—a conceptual shift earned through observation. However, escalation relies on off-stage founder reactions; Marcus’s restlessness is reported, not dramatized, weakening pressure coherence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the temple before inscriptions vanish—is signaled early and tightens at midnight when Veyra arrives with the prism. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to step into the hologram, accepting emotional inundation. Cost is unmistakable: she trades chronicler objectivity for visceral burden-bearing, crystallized when glyphs etch her skin. Coincidence (Veyra’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the temple’s rules demand active empathy, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering hidden truths—is signaled early and tightens when the ritual backfires, escalating pressure. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, employs her method, releases the seed, and breathes the spores. The meaningful deepening occurs when the vision reframes her violence not as evil but as self-defense shadowed by guilt—a shift that reweights her entire identity. Cost is felt: the burden of memory returns, yet she carries it lighter, proving stakes were viscerally real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael learns “chasing isn’t heeding,” forcing a trade-off between safety and integration. The meaningful deepening occurs at the throne: accepting scars as wounds, not just maps, raises the cost to her humanity. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to press the clipping to her heart—and the price (vanished scars, internalized covenant) is legible in the final image. Coincidence never resolves; the future arrives early due to her fear, a flaw she must confront.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (“patch holes in my soul”) is signaled early and tightens when Lirael realizes certainty was her flaw; the trade—recklessness for “fiercely gentle” wisdom—carries felt cost (the boy’s death, the Fool’s surrender). Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to sew, to eat the fruit, to reinterpret her past. The orchard’s demand (“inlay meaning everywhere”) deepens stakes by requiring active creation, not passive receipt. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from Lirael’s decisions under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens when Gus dismisses the cloth (“toss it”), forcing Lenny to choose between emotional insulation and connection. The escalation hinges on protagonist agency: researching the band, initiating contact. Cost is legible in his trembling hands and the implied risk of reopening old wounds. Coincidence (finding the crate) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the bassist call is earned. One tightening suffices, though the quarry’s “rocks to crush” pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting wisdom and energy—is signaled early and deepens when the seed blooms, raising the cost from intellectual risk to existential responsibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation: each observation (spirals, hums, roots) tightens the thematic knot. The “haunted ambitions” motif sharpens the moral calculus—ambition can be redirected, not discarded—but the lack of tangible loss (time, tool, stamina) slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through identity migration—is signaled early and tightened by the woman’s fear of loss. Her dive into the creel is an act of agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. The cost is visible: she sheds her sea-bound self to carry sky, and the librarian risks routine stagnation. Escalation occurs through density increase—contradictions accumulate until smelting becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolving emotional isolation through latent connection—is signaled early via the pearl’s etching (“forgive”) and deepens as confessions flood Elias. The heartbeat-of-hesitation moment forces a trade-off: preserve the pearl or activate the lattice. Agency drives escalation: Elias chooses connection over preservation, costing him the relic but enabling global resonance. Coincidence never resolves; the lattice responds to his intentional act, not chance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when graffiti reframes rivers as emotional conduits. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she follows arrows, plays chords, draws heart-maps. Cost is felt in her tremors and the irreversible act of transcribing pain into art. The tightening—from stagnant guilt to “meandering river”—narrows her path to surrender, though the lens slightly softens pressure by avoiding external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s decoding work. Escalation occurs via her increasing speed and the intensifying glow, culminating in the book’s revelation. While pressure is coherent under an Accumulative lens, the cost remains implied (the looming second letter) rather than paid; no tangible loss or irreversible choice occurs on the page, slightly softening the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—weighing personal dream against imperial destiny—is signaled early and tightens through two decisive propagations that reveal divergent futures. Agency drives escalation: Lira’s choices narrow options until she actively dismantles the dream. Cost is unmistakable: perforated destiny means love or loss slipping through unseen, crystallized in the “mulberry stain on the fabric of the world.”

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving Elion’s echo before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the chip dims and the pool cracks. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to embellish unconventionally, altering tactics under rising pressure. Cost is unmistakable—physical collapse, near-destruction of the grotto—and the trade-off (personal depletion for preservation) charges the final image. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her skill and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment through understanding rebirth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara reappears with the hairpin, forcing Lirael to confront fragile trust. The meaningful deepening occurs in Lirael’s realization that choices (forgiveness, return) are threads in the cycle. Cost is felt: three years of estrangement, emotional vulnerability, and the tremor in her knees. However, escalation leans slightly on coincidence (merchant’s guilt), though it complicates rather than resolves, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interpreting doubt vs. certainty—is signaled early and deepens when the cloak blurs Elias’s morality, raising personal cost. His agency drives escalation: choosing to wear the cloak, then unhooking oak, then guiding Mira to remove maple. Each choice narrows options (e.g., removing oak enables harmonic clarity) and exacts emotional price (vulnerability, exposure). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; wind merely facilitates the chime logic Elias deciphers through practiced skill.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing as appearing elsewhere—is signaled early and tightens when Lira intrudes, forcing Elara to maintain silence under emotional pressure. The deepening occurs through repeated stone throws, each narrowing the path to revelation until Lira’s own action earns insight. Cost is felt in Elara’s isolation and Lira’s burning frustration, though the escalation leans more on accumulation than direct confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering how to “navigate without moving”—is signaled early and tightens when the birds’ figure-eight contradicts prior assumptions. Kael’s agency drives escalation: his observation triggers memory (carvings), which enables reinterpretation. The cost is conceptual (generations wasted on false stillness) and felt in his solitude. Coincidence (birds arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to descend is earned. One tightening suffices, though a second pressure beat would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—finding sacredness in simplicity—is signaled early and deepens when Kael chooses personal memory over arcane power. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he activates the keystone, pours stolen starlight, and ultimately offers his sketch. Cost is felt (he abandons his quest for external validation), though the stakes remain internal and lack tangible consequence beyond emotional resonance, slightly limiting escalation intensity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—answering Lila’s luminous vow—is signaled early and deepens when the “13” door appears. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to enter, open the door, read the book. Cost is felt (emotional exposure, vulnerability) but could be more concrete—e.g., physical toll of wading or time lost. Coincidence (door number) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure tightens via sensory immersion rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the backwards prophecy to align with purpose—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes alignment requires shedding noise, not solving riddles. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he activates sensors, arranges coins, syncs mind, selects the tower-moon disc. Cost is felt in his trembling hands and shed doubt, though the contraction’s physical stakes remain abstract. One meaningful tightening suffices: the shift from interpreter to conduit forecloses passive analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and tightens when the echoes resist, forcing Elias to confront his trauma mid-ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (adjusting prism angle despite danger), and cost is unmistakable: the reaper’s heart beats again, but with the burden of named horrors. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening could more explicitly foreclose an option beyond emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance via the bell—is signaled early and tightens when the last fish is caught, raising urgency. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his calculations, scaffold-building, and drip-tweaking narrow options (e.g., accepting crack-widening as necessary). Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, risk of disaster (“This’ll end in disaster”), and the fragile, temporary fix. Coincidence (fish caught) complicates but doesn’t resolve; success stems from his precise calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory vs. letting go—is signaled early and deepens when the label reveals Elias’s fate. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes memories need a guardian, forcing her to shift from observer to participant. Cost is felt in her choked throat and the implied burden of shared stewardship. Though the woman’s arrival borders on coincidence, it complicates rather than resolves, preserving agency: Mara chooses to place her own photo, crystallizing stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens when the starlings reveal their “language,” forcing Elara to act (plunge into flame). The tightening forecloses her prior method of isolated study; she must now trust embodied instinct. Cost is visible in physical pain and emotional exposure, though the escalation leans slightly on revelation rather than active resistance or complication, holding it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (prevent arbor unraveling) is signaled early and tightens via lunar deadline and radio static’s urgency. Kael’s agency drives escalation: each node revision narrows options (deeper arbor, greater fatigue) and deepens knowledge (trust as language). Cost is felt physically (sweat, trembling) and existentially (mother’s vanished trust). Coincidence never resolves; success stems from inventive adaptation under inherited constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—custody over selfhood—is signaled early and tightens when Kael chooses synthesis over annihilation. Pressure escalates causally: clone’s taunt → Kael’s vivification → complementary opposites collide → brain catalyzes merger. Cost is felt: Kael risks total dissolution (“destroy us both”) to reclaim emotion. Agency drives escalation, though the clone’s rebellion backstory slightly dilutes immediacy of on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the seed’s meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the plant vanishes, forcing Elias to follow slime to the brook. Escalation is driven by his agency: orthogonal approaches (envelope analysis, spectrometry, planting) narrow options until he abandons force. Cost is conceptual: his identity as a puzzle-solver must evolve to embrace organic uncertainty. Coincidence (botanist’s past comment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the key emerges from his surrender to flow.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through bodily cost (blisters, hoarse voice, leaden arms). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each roar intensifies echo density until climax. Agency is clear (he chooses to persist), but escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—more endurance than tactical shift. Cost is felt but not leveraged to alter method, slightly limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting reality from boundary dissolution—is signaled early and deepens when Mara recognizes the pendant’s personal link (“symbols mirrored… childhood home”). Her agency drives escalation: waiting, then sacrificing the key, which forecloses collaboration with the cultist at visible cost (his collapse, her irreversible step into the library). Pressure tightens coherently under Causal lens; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Minor deduction: cultist’s sudden vulnerability (“voice trembled”) slightly softens oppositional force.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from cyclical stagnation—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes vivification requires self-sacrifice. Agency drives escalation: he chooses trial after trial, then chooses essence-pouring. Cost is unmistakable: hollowed mind, scarred hands. The tightening forecloses passivity, forcing a trade between self-preservation and rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the hush to uncover rebirth—is signaled early and tightens when Kael dismantles obsolete systems, foreclosing the city’s old function. Agency is clear: his choice to discard assumptions drives escalation, culminating in the tower’s transformation. Cost is felt: the star fragment dulls, symbolizing relinquished fame for silent potential. However, external opposition is minimal; resistance comes from inert machinery, not active counter-pressure, slightly muting conflict intensity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing unfinished journeys—is signaled early and tightens when the dock vanishes, forcing Kael to merge timelines at reality’s risk. His agency drives escalation: tuning the radio, broadcasting the pattern, shattering the hourglass. Cost is felt in the ferry’s unraveling and his isolation. However, the “parallel timelines” premise slightly abstracts stakes; emotional weight carries more than conceptual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightens when the thread erupts, forcing Clara to weave anew in void. Agency is maintained: her choice to continue weaving creates the door. Cost is conceptual (abandoning empirical certainty) but legible in the final stance: “she’d never look at the world the same way again.” Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of threads intensifies until rupture—but the transition to void lacks tactile resistance, softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating existential uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael takes students to the city’s edge, foreclosing classroom safety. Cost is legible: her vulnerability (“felt adrift”) becomes pedagogical method. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to reinterpret the chain, not wait for revelation. Minor flaw: alien light’s mutability raises stakes but isn’t tested beyond dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—assuring unspoken love—is signaled early and tightens when the pulse proves traceable. Escalation is driven by Lila’s agency: she chooses to press the dead hearing aid to her ear, follow the thrum, and place her device beside its twin. The cost is felt in the widow’s trembling hands and Lila’s emotional burden, though not physically dramatized. Coincidence (finding identical hearing aid) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the duet is earned by Lila’s persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making the invisible visible—is signaled early and tightens when the tide rises, forcing Lira to act before drowning. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting the formula, applying the gold, activating the system. Cost is felt (water at waist, facility collapsing) and conceptual (proof replaces reunion). One tightening suffices, though the “phase transition” method lacks on-page experimentation—it works instantly, slightly softening the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating existence against digital erasure—is signaled early and deepens when OBS-7 demands a binary choice. Elias’s agency lies in reframing, not resolving: he defragments to affirm contradiction, not fix it. The cost is felt in physical pain (shard in palm), emotional weight (carrying her fear), and systemic futility (“error… unresolved”). Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each heartbeat, ink swirl, and AI prompt intensifies the central tension without coincidence or reset.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting extinct languages through resonance—is signaled early and tightens when the diamond reveals its true nature as a mirror of fear. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her humming triggers the climax, and her choice to hurl the diamond forecloses the path of translation. Cost is unmistakable—the seared palm, scattered birds, silenced canyon—but the tightening doesn’t narrow options so much as reconfigure their meaning, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cryptid’s lure—tightens when confessions implicate Elara’s own bitterness, forcing metamorphosis as the only path to truth. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she lifts the handset despite mission parameters, triggering irreversible change. Cost is dual: loss of human identity and the burden of knowing “harmony is played.” Static isn’t coincidence but the garden’s moral gravity well, making stakes viscerally heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening wild beauty—is signaled early and tightens when Lira notices the statue’s crack, forcing higher-risk action. Escalation is driven by her agency: playing harder, using the shell as flute, enduring physical cost. The statues’ crystalline cores flickering under musical assault shows coherent pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: snapped string, bleeding fingers, irreversible destruction of order—but no false resets or convenient resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fostering connection across broken promises—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses the bottle over routine mail. His agency drives escalation: smuggling creates risk, drone delivery enables payoff. Cost is felt—the storm’s aftermath leaves soldiers awed but border intact, implying fragile, temporary truce. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Elias’s “respectfully rebellious” act initiates change, though outcome remains precarious under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in quiet—is signaled early and deepens when Elio sings, transforming observation into creation. Escalation is protagonist-driven: discovery of the fragment leads to door, then song, each narrowing options (he must risk breaking silence). Cost is felt: his voice replaces ambient sound, demanding courage. Coincidence (wind bells chiming) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in his response.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening dormant stories—is signaled early and deepens via Eleanor’s midnight ritual. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses to visualize hyperbolic curves, triggering the library’s transformation. Cost is conceptual (years of cataloging forgotten texts, heavy silence) but not viscerally felt; the resolution grants reward without sacrifice. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, yet the absence of foreclosed paths softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when the paint “refuses to blend” and pulses alive, forcing Elara’s feverish brushwork. Agency drives escalation: her choice to “paint anyway” despite fear of lateness culminates in the dream’s materialization. Cost is unmistakable—the dream dissolves beyond grasp, yet she gains internal integration (“etched into her bones”). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shifts (calm ritual → frantic creation → still resolution), though the dream’s sentience risks minor coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing a truth trapped by fear—is signaled early and tightens when Elias defies the woman’s wishes, accepting cosmic risk. His agency drives escalation: inserting the pick, pressing on despite deepening cold. Cost is felt in the world’s unraveling and his disorientation, though the nexus’s shudder borders on metaphor over physical consequence. The stakes remain viscerally tied to emotional liberation, not abstract “reality reshaping.”

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early via Clara’s journal and the dream. Escalation occurs through Elias’s agency: he maps broken constellations, aligns them with wrecks, and retrieves the locket. The deepening (“mushrooms are keys… price…”) tightens options by linking celestial patterns to physical artifacts. Cost is felt conceptually—the decades lost, the emotional toll—but could be more viscerally rendered in the present moment (e.g., physical sacrifice).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reversing communal exile through personal confrontation—is signaled early and tightens when the visitor arrives. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: she interprets tea leaves, dictates the method (“walk backwards”), and frames sacrifice as necessary. Cost is felt in her isolation and the village’s suffering, though the exact price remains conceptual. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via symbolic convergence (light, leaves, posture), not causal turns, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and tightens when the seed demands sacrifice. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she climbs, cuts, distills, and hurls. The cost (seed’s loss, emotional exhaustion) is felt, and the waterfall’s resolved dissonance proves stakes were real. Coincidence never resolves; magic responds to earned action. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical constraint (e.g., time limit) could’ve pushed this to 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—grounding spirits by breaking silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reveals the 1600s suicide. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unravel despite fear, tightening options until the net bursts. Cost is unmistakable—physical ache, emotional vulnerability—and culminates in the key, which reconfigures her future path. Coincidence (“stars aligned”) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough stems from Mara’s needlework.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reopening the chapel by interpreting silence—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s agency: his film comparison reveals the henge’s evolution, his sextant alignment activates the mechanism. The tightening occurs when he chooses empathy over analysis (pressing ear to stone), foreclosing his old identity as border-drawer. Cost is legible: he trades certainty for mystery, framing maps “with questions” henceforth. Coincidence (rain stopping) complements but doesn’t resolve; the hum persists as earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering memory’s persistence—is signaled early and tightens when the 12-second loop reveals intentional encoding. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her algorithms, cross-referencing, and rewinding deepen knowledge and narrow interpretation. Cost is felt in trembling hands and reframed grief, though the “quantum communication” leap risks slight convenience. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—articulating the unspoken—is signaled early and deepens through three encoded messages, each raising emotional stakes (Lira’s absence, brother’s death, self-silence). The storm’s arrival tightens pressure: Elias works *during* lightning, trusting the ghost thrives in chaos. Cost is felt in tremors, warmth transfer, and the irreversible act of pressing the bluebell. Agency is consistent, though escalation leans textural over causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth beneath grief—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses to disclose rather than conceal. Agency resides in attention and renunciation: she forfeits servant invisibility to offer the diary, altering relational dynamics. Cost is felt in the widow’s hitched breath and Mara’s irreversible stance. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of symbols, warmth, hum, and light intensify until the phoenix entry crystallizes the core paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating “spooled wholeness”—is signaled early and tightens when the gondola snaps, stranding Lila mid-proof. The deepening occurs as clouds escalate from joy to rage to sorrow, culminating in the void that “pulses with ghostly echoes.” Agency lies in attention: Lila chooses to memorialize despite mockery, and that stance crystallizes with visible cost—professional exile, physical peril, emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge beyond physical form—is signaled early and deepens when Lira shifts from documenting decay to embodying the guild’s sky-mirroring ritual. Escalation is driven by her agency: aligning the coin, choosing to paint constellations, carrying the safe away. Cost is felt in the tree’s groan, the blank canvas sacrificed, and the crew’s chaos ignored. Coincidence (receiving the coin) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn comes from her interpretive action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—charting discovery—is signaled early and tightens when the hopscotch board reveals coordinates. Lira’s agency deepens stakes: her notes narrow options until only a leap remains. Cost is felt—Jax’s warning, captain’s fury—but luck (starlings parting) complicates rather than resolves. The “stranded luminance” raises conceptual stakes without overreach; pressure coheres causally to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to mend time through celestial repair—is signaled early and deepens via the Hall of Mirrors’ psychological pressure. The tightening occurs when Kael identifies the “reflection that does not belong,” forcing a choice that risks delusion or revelation. Agency drives escalation: deciphering prophecy, applying liquid light, fitting tools into the lock—all stem from his decisions. Cost is felt in emotional vulnerability (“ache,” “doubt”) though physical or tangible sacrifice is minimal; a stronger price (e.g., loss of the vial, injury from jagged glass) would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the arches to save the orchard and nebula—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses chalked messages over direct intervention, forcing reliance on collective interpretation. Her agency drives escalation: each message deepens settler commitment until they mobilize tools and courage. Cost is visible in their labor and Elara’s exhaustion (“flickering like a candle flame”), and the resolution hinges on their unified effort, not coincidence. The single meaningful tightening—transition from doubt to action—narrows options toward collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—gentling the world’s end—is signaled early and deepens when Mara must confront her own imperfection to complete the task. Escalation is driven by her agency: placing the puppet head, pressing her palm, choosing to sing. Cost is visible: the pane cracks, the puppet shatters, and time softens globally. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though a second tactical constraint (e.g., physical danger from the crumbling tower) could have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—guide travelers or wither—is signaled early and tightens when the traveler’s cry coincides with bird patrols. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses imperfect markers despite risk, culminating in the tunnel shove. Cost is felt in bodily tension (“froze,” “braced”) and environmental response (labyrinth shudders). The curse’s rules remain consistent; luck complicates (birds dive) but doesn’t resolve—the door works because Kael deciphers the nut.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting through shared grief—is signaled early and tightens when Elara interprets river foam as proof that “separation isn’t an end.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the studio: their clashing notes force a trade-off between safety and harmony. Cost is felt in Mara’s raw admission (“Afraid to finish the song”) and Elara’s relinquishment of analytical distance. Coincidence (Mara’s text) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—providing authentic beginnings—is signaled early and deepens when the shadowed man demands a story “that could go either way,” forcing Elara to confront the risk of her craft. Her agency lies in release, not control; the cost is uncertainty. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens: each patron’s request intensifies the weight of absence until the moonlight’s return reconfigures meaning. No false resolutions—luck complicates (the note returns), but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—alleviating collective remorse—is signaled early and deepens when Nessar realizes understanding isn’t enough; he must absorb. His agency drives escalation: entering the forbidden pavilion, submerging hands, accepting contagion. Cost is unmistakable: temporary possession by the founder’s guilt, physical unsteadiness, and the permanent weight now shared across the fortress. The guard’s retreat confirms stakes are socially embedded, not merely personal.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing fractured connection between scholars and villagers—is signaled early and deepens when Elara links the silent clock to “the silence between people.” Escalation occurs through her unconventional method (singing in multiple languages), which tightens pressure by risking ridicule or failure. The grain elevator’s softened creaks mark a turning point that narrows options: now reconciliation is possible, not just mechanical repair. Cost is felt socially (villagers’ prior alienation) and embodied (her trembling hands, solitary labor).

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—becoming an “archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is signaled early and deepens via the mirror’s memory entanglement. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency (laser etching, headband adjustments), narrowing options as feedback threatens overwhelm. Yet the cost remains largely conceptual; no tangible loss (time, tool, stamina) alters tactics. The tightening is meaningful but lacks visceral stakes—a missed opportunity for higher escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where “forgotten combinations hide”—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking clock (57 minutes) and gravity inversion. Agency is clear: Lira chooses paths, interprets doodles, and retrieves the key. The escalation is driven by her intuition and knowledge, not coincidence, and culminates in a meaningful trade-off: she gains the key but assumes eternal vigilance. Cost is conceptual yet palpable in the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making the silent world sing—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elara’s bodily sacrifice (bleeding nails, aching shoulders). Escalation is driven by her agency: each dawn return tightens pressure until the porcelain breaks, forcing the grove to “strum itself.” Cost is unmistakable: the insulator’s destruction, her tears, and the irreversible transformation of the forest. Coincidence never resolves; the music emerges only after relentless, costly effort.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating the covenant before the eclipse—tightens when the stone glows and projects constellations, forcing Alaric to act, not just correlate. His agency drives escalation: kneeling, recalling Lira, inserting the key. Cost is felt in his exile, solitude, and the irreversible opening of the stone. The “queen moves diagonally” insight crystallizes the thematic trade-off: power within constraint. Coincidence (Lira’s key) is pre-established, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding familial silence—is signaled early and deepens when Lirael shifts tactics from mechanical force to resonant frequency, narrowing options meaningfully. Agency drives escalation: her humming choice responds to fireworks’ disruption, not coincidence. Cost is legible: she relinquishes control (no more picks/oil) for vulnerability (voice as key). One tightening suffices, but pressure could feel more visceral—stakes remain intellectualized.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity amid village unrest—is signaled early and tightens when the seed refuses to sprout, forcing Lira to confront her impatience. Her agency drives escalation: adjusting soil, humming lullabies, then choosing stillness after the dream. Cost is felt in jagged doodles, eroded confidence, and social friction with elders. The bloom resolves not through luck but earned reconfiguration, though the elders’ shift borders on convenient without deeper interpersonal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the source of planetary resilience—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the arrow tip vibrates and guides Lira toward the cavern. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to follow the river, wade through vines, insert the tip. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of the artifact-as-tool and the foreclosed path of technological extraction. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory density (crimson leaves, whirling silence, glowing spheres) rather than external antagonism, which is appropriate. Coincidence never resolves; the river’s pull is a natural consequence of inversion physics established upfront.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the drone crashed—is signaled early and deepens into survival and ontological revelation. Anya’s agency drives escalation: her documentation leads to data alignment, which prompts climbing, which reveals the engineer and the truth. The tightening occurs when wind gusts spike to 45 mph, foreclosing safe retreat and forcing ascent. Cost is unmistakable: she gains dangerous knowledge that cannot be unlearned, crystallized in the Charged Poise of dawn’s return masking an awakened threat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving wonder is essential—is signaled by Lira’s opening resolve and deepens when Veyra’s disbelief becomes visceral proof. Pressure escalates via sensory invasion: the distant clang disrupts, then Lira’s song reconfigures reality. Agency lies in Lira’s subtle method (not force), and cost is conceptual—Veyra’s worldview shatters, marble awakens—but lacks a tangible personal sacrifice. Still, the single meaningful tightening (silence → symphony) suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mastering the flute to confront failure—is signaled early and tightens when Kael shifts from seeking answers to unmaking failures. The meaningful deepening occurs at the chamber confrontation, where agency drives escalation: he chooses dissonance, triggering the starfield vision. Cost is felt (broken flute, shattered past selves) and alters tactics—silence becomes the new method. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from Kael’s choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can emotion be mathematized?—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment resists calculation. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his deliberate ambiguity tactic leads directly to the transposition breakthrough. The cost—emotional inundation, shattered detachment—is unmistakable and alters his final stance. Coincidence never resolves; the artifact’s behavior follows established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trusting relics as seeds—tightens when the pendant vibrates harder upon the woman’s arrival, forcing Kail’s choice: obey or flee. His agency drives escalation; he plants the seed despite doubt, narrowing options to irreversible action. Cost is visible in his frayed nerves becoming purposeful calm. Coincidence (woman knowing schedule) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the relic’s mechanics do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating her theory against her mentor’s dismissal—is signaled early and tightens when the prism glows and the arbor pulses, raising hope before the reversal. Agency drives escalation: Mara chooses to project, interpret frost, enter the arbor, demand clarity—all leading to the shattering. Cost is unmistakable: her foundational assumption collapses alongside the glass, forcing renunciation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the arbor’s true nature emerges from her own projection, making the reversal causally earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the completed puzzle dissolves, demanding sacrifice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: sorting pieces, chasing the crow, slotting the final edge. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the ancestral bead and permanent isolation. Coincidence (box washing up) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is hers. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, though the crow theft leans slightly toward contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Veyra’s fading vitality—is signaled early and tightens when Jorin enters the mine. His agency drives escalation: choosing the humming tunnel, enduring shards, accepting the orb. Cost is unmistakable (physical wounds, isolation), though the spectral guide’s intervention borders on convenient. Still, the deepening (“confront the rubble within”) narrows options credibly under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens when the shard overrides Kael’s caution. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to step into the portal, then to hurl the shard away. Cost is felt (“weight was gone… that felt like enough”) and irreversible. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems from character-bound compulsion and maternal legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving safety when the lamp fails—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s agency: he chooses to participate in the chain, altering tactics from passive maintenance to active co-creation. Each new note raises emotional stakes by reframing endurance as collective. The cost is felt: he abandons reliance on institutional light for uncertain, human-made signals. Coincidence (finding the glass) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his decisions drive escalation under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping the new dawn—is signaled early and tightens when shadows reveal gold *and* oily darkness, forcing a trade-off between hope and peril. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each wick adjustment deepens knowledge, culminating in total internal reflection as a high-stakes method. Cost is unmistakable—the burden of duality (“light and dark were twins”) crystallizes her stance. One meaningful deepening suffices, executed with Accumulative lens precision.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why some magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens when the wing’s flare reveals narrative communion among travelers. Lin’s agency drives escalation: she unscrews the vial, follows the light, witnesses the tale. Cost is felt in her irreversible transformation: the wing vanishes, but her new lens remains. Coincidence (sun alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight stems from her active witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping sorrow to maintain the labyrinth—is signaled early and deepens when the sextant reveals dream-constellations. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to dismantle, sketch, and step through the wall. Cost is felt in the fragility of the pin’s echo and the weight of accumulated grief, though no tangible loss (time, tool, stamina) alters tactics. The storm intensifies pressure, but coincidence (storm fading as insight arrives) slightly undermines earned causality—luck complicates *and* resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“rekindle dying realm”) tightens when Lira draws the lullaby into mica—a trade-off between personal exhaustion and communal revival. Escalation driven by her agency: humming ignites fruit, which frays night. Cost legible: “exhausted but peaceful,” realm’s pulse quickens *because* she risks voice. Coincidence (child humming) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lira’s action transforms it.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling grief through hidden wisdom—is signaled early and tightens at midnight, when Eleanor must engage rather than observe. Her agency drives escalation: she follows the map, enters the mirror chamber, accepts the key. The cost is felt: confronting paths not taken, admitting being “lost.” Though societal pressure is light, the internal stakes escalate credibly under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses passive mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—finding the sacred beneath creeping normality—is signaled early and deepens when Elias confronts the impossible bread, forcing a choice between preservation and participation. His decision to plant a seed (not eat the bread) narrows his path: he commits to generative action over passive witness, with visible cost (trembling hands, daily labor). Pressure escalates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens, and the guerrilla gardening motif crystallizes as quiet rebellion. While the woman’s arrival slightly risks deus ex machina, her role is minimal and thematically reinforcing, not resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as vows dissolve. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she samples frequencies faster, adjusts tools, and persists despite failure. The cost is legible (frustration, exhaustion, temporal pressure) and culminates in a trade-off: success requires sacrificing composure (“slammed her fist”) and racing time. Dawn’s arrival resolves tension but doesn’t erase fragility—the magic flares, then steadies, implying ongoing vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent weaponization of broken trust—is signaled early and tightens via the midnight deadline. Lira’s agency drives escalation: bribing, following, sacrificing the fob, then smashing the device. Cost is visceral—the fob’s destruction—and forecloses reconciliation with her father’s legacy. Coincidence (dockhand’s betrayal) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on her choice. Slightly below 9+ because the buyer’s arrival at *exactly* midnight edges toward convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and tightens when the compass targets the bluff itself, forcing Kael to confront that places, not just people, hold atmospheric agency. The deepening occurs via protagonist-driven action: his convergence triggers the election’s climax, costing him his empirical certainty. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as sensory intensification (ozone → soot → blood-copper) that reweights his skepticism into reluctant awe, with irreversible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming buried creativity—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s tactile engagement with tools (charcoal, brush, lock). The meaningful tightening occurs when he paints the lock as a screaming mouth, transforming passive regret into active confrontation. Cost is felt in the “suffocating” weight of years wasted and the vulnerability of sketching again, though the resolution leans slightly toward ease—the lock opens without resistance, risking a soft reset. Still, the auroral sorrow and “steady and sure” breath imply earned poise, not magical cure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering her mother’s last words—is signaled early and deepens when revealed as impossible; escalation occurs via the keeper’s confession that voices are “repurposed,” not preserved. Elara’s agency shines in her reframing (“It’s a seed”), which crystallizes stance with conceptual cost: accepting echoes over truth. Pressure remains coherent under a Hybrid lens, though the thief-to-keeper shift slightly softens oppositional force.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against a noisy world—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s construction of the sculpture, which narrows her options to total commitment. Agency is expressed through renunciation (silence) and creation (kinetic art), culminating in the irreversible melting of the iceberg. Cost is felt in the fragment’s disappearance and the visitors’ wordless awe—a tangible shift in human behavior. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the external pressure from “the world below” remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing chaos before it overloads her systems—is signaled by paragraph two and tightens when the box’s seals fray. Clara-7’s agency drives escalation: she recalls “control burns,” chooses fire, and endures absorption. The cost is felt (“static surged… fingers trembling”) and reconfigures her relationship to imperfection. Magnetic drift complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes through her decisive act, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the mailbox’s secret—is signaled early and deepens through layered testimonies. Pressure escalates via accumulating lore (war couple, ghostly figure), narrowing options until only the combination remains. Agency is Clara’s: she chooses to listen, synthesize, and dial. Cost is felt in the soldier’s truncated farewell and Clara’s emotional reckoning. Coincidence (shared name “Clara”) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real key is earned through listening.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating truth encrypted in vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens when drones activate, forcing Kael to weaponize dance. His agency drives escalation: mirroring gestures unlocks chamber, dancing overloads drones. Cost is felt: he risks everything for a vial representing hope born from another’s death. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his skill and resolve do.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the coffee grounds reveal the concentric path, narrowing options to a single descent. The fluctuating gravity imposes physical cost (heaviness, stumbling), forcing Elias to cling to the pattern as anchor. Though pockets of gravity complicate, they don’t resolve; agency lies in his interpretation and persistence. The tightening culminates in a trade-off: personal retrieval yields to communal guidance, with emotional cost legible in his changed lantern-lighting rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hushing the prophecy to save the haven—is signaled early and tightens when the wing absorbs water, forcing the summoner to commit fully. Escalation is driven by her agency: mapping silence, placing the wing, enduring the cost. Though pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, the “cosmic roar” threat remains abstract; a more visceral consequence would heighten felt cost. Still, the trade-off (crane destroyed, peace saved) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting or revealing the library’s true nature—is signaled early and escalates via the Leonids’ arrival. Elias’s agency drives the climax: he chooses to speak, despite fear. The cost is physical (dust, vibration) and existential (the building’s voice answers). One meaningful tightening suffices: the meteor shower forces immediate action, narrowing options from passive guardianship to active invocation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into agency—is signaled early and deepens when the shell’s whisper becomes her own voice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: arranging shells, invoking resonance, choosing to repurpose rather than discard memory. Cost is felt: loss of the garden, confrontation with abandonment. One tightening suffices—the shift from passive archiving to active ritual—but the “resonance structures” mechanic borders on convenient without clearer prior signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking cycles of vengeance—is signaled early and tightened when Lirael uses the queen’s thorn to bind blood to parchment, foreclosing deception-for-power in favor of “forgiveness.” Escalation is driven by her agency: each stroke of the quill narrows options until only one path remains—sacrificial offering. Cost is unmistakable: trembling fingers, aching joints, the echo of footsteps as “countdown.” The spiral cipher deepens stakes by demanding internal recognition—those who don’t understand see “only a scribble,” raising the price of peace to self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—why some voices echo—is signaled early and deepens at the fissure (“unfinished stories”) and summit (“refuse to let go”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each ascent beat layers emotional weight, culminating in Kael’s Charged Poise—choosing to sing despite the burden. Cost is conceptual (bearing collective grief) and felt through embodied melancholy, though no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path appears on-page. Agency is present but muted; Kael receives revelation more than wrests it, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring fractured ancestral bonds—is signaled early and deepens through each dream shard. Pressure tightens as Kael moves from observation to intervention, culminating in his decision to weave truth into dreams. Agency is clear: he chooses exposure over silence, altering tactics after learning the sailor’s love, not blame, anchors the haunting. Cost is felt in the son’s guilt, the widow’s lost daughter, and the lighthouse keeper’s endless vigil—all made legible through Kael’s earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering hidden patterns—is signaled early and tightens when fireflies reveal coded pulses, forcing Kael to act (tracing rhythms with the whisk). Agency is attentional but consequential: his choice to engage the pattern forecloses passive observation. Cost is conceptual but felt: the “demure audacity” realization demands surrender to mystery without resolution. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, though external pressure remains atmospheric rather than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—containing reality-warping leakage—is signaled early and escalates via Mara’s own agency: reassembling letters deepens knowledge, placing the diamond triggers the fissure, choosing which gem to sacrifice forecloses paths. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the flawed diamond, relinquishing potential power for collective survival. Pressure coheres causally; no coincidence resolves the crisis. The only slight softening is the off-page antagonist (“someone—or something”), but Crane’s warning letters compensate with credible prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the storm’s language to prevent civilizational collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the radio voice commands, “Seek the third eye in the storm’s eye.” Kael’s activation of the refraction mechanism is a meaningful tightening that narrows options: he must become the conduit. Cost is felt in his physical strain (“joints protesting”) and irreversible role shift, though the external consequence for the oblivious city remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—making “the dead speak loud enough to wake the living”—tightens when the music box plays his mother’s lullaby, shifting goal from abstract yearning to tangible proof. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses which sounds to capture, which verse to keep. Cost is felt in discarded drafts and emotional exposure (“faces soften” implies vulnerability). Coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; success hinges on his methodical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the key’s balance—is signaled early and deepens when malevolence manifests as the ghost. Pressure escalates causally: faltering frequency → wraith emergence → sonic clash. Elias’s agency drives escalation (he matches pitch, activates resonator), and cost is visible: trembling hands, burning legs, near-collapse. The tightening—shifting from shattering ice to harmonizing souls—forecloses brute-force solutions and reweights the key’s purpose under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unyoking power through patience—is signaled early and deepens via Kael’s failed attempt, which forces recalibration. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses slowness over speed, aligning moonlight by “fractions of a degree.” Cost is visible: backache ignored, breath fogging goggles, exhaustion at dawn. The “patient revolution” isn’t passive—it’s active restraint with tangible price. Minor deduction: secondary stake (soothing lake spirits) lacks on-page tension beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing preventable deaths—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mara finds the “Eliminate” files, foreclosing her prior compliance. Protagonist agency drives escalation: lighting the lantern triggers visions that expose Cole’s manipulation, leading to her tactical shift toward empirical evidence. Cost is felt in her shattered trust and the weight of centuries, crystallized in her refusal to be controlled. Coincidence (train rumble) complicates but doesn’t resolve; tension sharpens via moral calculus (truth vs. safety).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether rehabilitation can authentically repair lives—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus sees the “apology in metal.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his deliberate observation leads to insight, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he must now commit to transforming institutional apology into action, risking credibility or failure. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, and the moral calculus sharpens cleanly without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and tightens through kaleidoscope visions that narrow options (e.g., rejecting crash-image, embracing transliteration-as-flight). Agency is clear: Lira chooses to mount the *Skein* and hurl the tip. Cost is visible in trembling hands, straining braces, and the workshop’s decay. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: image density increases until action crystallizes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering corporate erasure via Elara’s disappearance—is signaled early and tightens at the video log, which redefines the gateway as a weapon. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she cross-references, cracks encryption, acts on coordinates. Cost is felt: surveillance, imminent capture, betrayal by Hale. The lie (“corrupted data”) isn’t just obstruction—it reveals systemic complicity, raising stakes from curiosity to existential threat. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from Lira’s choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—quelling a storm of collective fear through empathy—is signaled early and deepens via the mirror ritual. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: each glimpse tightens her resolve, culminating in the decisive placement of the mended fragment. Cost is felt (absorbing terror, grief, loss) and visible in the glowing crystal. Coincidence never resolves; the storm yields only to earned empathic action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to surrender to numbness or re-engage—is signaled early and tightens when the fissure’s wail forces action. Lila’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the pull, converting passive trawling into decisive intervention. The cost is visible—not pride, but the irreversible shift from seeking death to accepting fragile life. Coincidence (the scientist’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the rescue hinges on Lila’s choice to act.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Lila’s search for artistic/emotional authenticity—is signaled early and deepens through her confession of feeling “nothing.” The tightening occurs when she abandons painting and accepts the letter, narrowing her path from perfectionism to embrace of imbalance. Cost is felt but could be more viscerally tied to a concrete loss (e.g., ruined canvas, missed opportunity).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of wisdom—is signaled early and deepens through the consecration ritual. Pressure escalates via the pavilion’s urging, the parapet’s response, and the shared labor that demands vulnerability (Mara’s mask falling). The tightening occurs when both characters commit fully, narrowing options to success or loss of the echo. Cost is legible: Mara’s exposed scars, the prophet’s sweat, the irreversible locking of the parapet. Agency is shared but Mara drives the critical micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief into beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Lila’s lingering and sketching. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from documenting decay to recognizing its inherent completeness (“the masterpiece was already complete”). Cost is conceptual (abandoning the need to “fix” pain) and visible in her changed action (returning to shoot, not just mourn). Agency drives escalation, though pressure remains internal and low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding knowledge’s nonlinear growth—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal reveals hidden patterns. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he interprets, records, and ultimately commits to sharing. The cost is conceptual (rejecting tidy academic norms) and social (risking dismissal), but it’s implied rather than dramatized through tangible loss, slightly softening the pressure’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s deteriorating physical state and sharpening focus. His agency lies in ritual construction and persistent redirection of driftwood markers, narrowing options until only the bicycle tower remains. Cost is visible in raw hands and aching knees, though the escalation lacks a true reversal—only fading echoes and shifting fog. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the hum’s return suffices as meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—defying entropy by capturing or redirecting time’s flow—is signaled early and tightens when the clock’s spin becomes a code requiring decoding. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to stay, to listen, to restructure, to sing. Each turn forecloses safety (Dr. Marlowe flees; Elias doesn’t) and exacts cost (trembling hands, deafening roar). The final leap crystallizes his stance: not fixing time but escaping its tyranny. Coincidence complicates (the quake) but resolution is earned through his skill and insight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—executing a meaningful goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when bloodwork confirms Elias’s hours. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the vinyl shard, hums, leans in, guiding the reunification. Cost is visible: her raw throat, chest ache, and inherited grief. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory and emotional layering rather than causal turns, which is valid—but the stakes never narrow options beyond the single scene’s parameters.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering sealed awakenings to locate noon shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the moon aligns and the shadow points north, forcing a live choice. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: her theory leads to telescope adjustment, then key insertion. Cost is visible (physical depletion) and conceptual (exposing a time-reversed realm). The “spoons bent reality” timeframe functions as catalyst but doesn’t resolve conflict; Lirael’s actions do.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling truth with loss—is signaled early via the drowned body and Mara’s tooth. Pressure tightens when Elias reveals the garden demands sacrifice, transforming her goal from debunking to mending. The bone-setting method becomes a meaningful deepening: realigning disjointed identity, not just limbs. Cost is felt in Mara’s relinquished certainty and Elias’s aged grief, though the escalation leans slightly more on revelation than active choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crafting a fireless beacon to honor her mother—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes stillness is “the space between heartbeats.” The weighing scene forecloses hoarding; releasing the pearl enacts renunciation with visible cost (it vanishes). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each polishing stroke thickens air, sharpens memory, culminating in release. Coincidence (star winking) complicates but doesn’t resolve—closure hinges on Elara’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether grief can be grafted into growth—is signaled early and deepens through Lila’s arrangement of stones and confession aftermath. The meaningful tightening occurs when she offers the drip pattern as metaphor, risking rejection. Cost is unmistakable: raw exposure to judgment, fear of “losing him twice.” Elias’s presence intensifies pressure by offering understanding without demand, forcing Lila’s choice to stay—a renunciation of isolation with relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether stories must end neatly—is signaled early and deepens when Clara confronts her own pattern. The tightening occurs when she deletes the chapter, foreclosing her old method with tangible cost (loss of control, exposure to uncertainty). Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency: she chooses to follow the stranger, then to rewrite. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density (ephemeral cameos, thickening mist) rather than causal turns, which is valid—but the cost, while felt, lacks a concrete secondary consequence (e.g., lost time, broken tool), limiting escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving sacred practices—is signaled early and tightens when the tendril demands release “tonight, under the harvest moon,” creating temporal pressure. Lira’s agency drives escalation: her plucking initiates the spin, her voice deepens the ritual, her planting seeds continuity. Cost (physical exhaustion, emotional vulnerability) is felt but not transformative; the forest’s revival arrives smoothly, with minimal friction or trade-off beyond effort. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—the moon’s alignment is a condition, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sealing safekept starlight to translate heartbeats into maps—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s methodical construction, which forecloses impatience (a live option given past failures). The deepening occurs when the plate hums in sync with his heartbeat, raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt physically (aching fingers, stiff legs) and conceptually (years of searching, three prior losses). Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no external interference or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid the “wounded season”—tightens when Elias discovers micro-etchings, narrowing options to precise gear alignment. Escalation is driven by his agency (daily returns, mapping shifts), not coincidence. Cost is felt in the keepers’ desperation and Elias’s philosophical unease. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical reversal could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting burdens without shattering them—is signaled early and deepens when Kael confronts the obsidian child-face, forcing a tactical shift (angling flame at the base). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each burden adds density, culminating in the locket’s refusal. Cost is felt in physical strain and emotional restraint, though the escalation lacks a second tightening beyond the obsidian breakthrough. Coincidence (draft extinguishing flame) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming paralyzing grief into tangible meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Clara chooses to carve despite raw pain. The tightening occurs in her first cut: a renunciation of passivity that narrows her future to active remembrance. Cost is felt (emotional labor, confronting memory) but not fully dramatized as physical or social consequence. Agency drives escalation, though the conflict remains internal and static in external pressure—no antagonist, only time and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escaping self-blame—is signaled early and tightens when Veyra chooses to drop the camera wheel, narrowing her path to forgiveness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: collecting stories, confronting the ghost, renouncing the relic. Cost is unmistakable (“I’m tired,” the vanished wheel). However, the pressure deepens more through atmosphere than decisive tactical shifts, slightly limiting the score under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—repurposing decay into hope—is signaled early and deepens when Lila shifts from seeking to *building*. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses redirection over restoration, narrowing her goal to one luminous equation. Cost is conceptual (a raw, untested formula) but not viscerally felt; no tool breaks, time runs out, or physical price is paid. Agency is strong, yet escalation leans intellectual over experiential, limiting pressure intensity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling safety with selfhood—is signaled early and tightens when the bear’s presence forces Lira to choose between retreat and connection. The deepening occurs through protagonist agency: her touch initiates harmonic resonance, altering her understanding of silence. Cost is felt (“slow erosion of the self”) and visible in her lighter steps post-encounter. Coincidence (bear appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Lira’s attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the architecture of lies—is signaled early and deepens when the blueprint reveals narrative manipulation as engineered. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to enter the warehouse, interpret the sundial, and confront the machine’s implications. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence about history) but legible in the dawn-lit clarity. Yet the “tightening” lacks tangible sacrifice—no resource, relationship, or opportunity is visibly forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding ancestral knowledge before it’s lost—is clear early and deepens as each knot reveals practical wisdom. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Elias aligns glass to rope, interprets glyphs, deduces the weavers’ true nature. Cost is felt (failing eyesight, isolation, cold) and culminates in Charged Poise: he understands the promise but must continue alone. Fog’s advance tightens time without artificial ticking.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding absence to heal—is signaled early and deepens when Elara projects presence, risking emotional exposure. The tightening occurs during the vision: she writes faster as the cost of witnessing becomes palpable (“chest ached with lonesome splendor”). Though the conflict is internal and lyrical, the escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, and forecloses passive ignorance in favor of active witness.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening organic beauty—is signaled early and tightens when the egg glows, forcing Corvin to confront hope’s fragility. His agency drives escalation: hypothesizing, assembling, adjusting moonlight. The cost is felt in his trembling, solitude, and the world’s withered state. Though the resolution leans slightly on wonder over struggle, the “bitterly sweet” ache of imperfect rebirth grounds the stakes emotionally and thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and tightened when Mara’s bird forces Lira to act, not just reflect. The escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: she chooses to intervene, to lie gently, to release. Cost is legible in her chest “loosening”—a small but felt emotional price for risking connection. The cloud migration subtly tightens time, but the real pressure is internal, coherently intensified under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped memories—is clear from the outset and deepens through seven escalating breadcrumbs. The tightening occurs at the drain: Lira must physically sacrifice comfort (scraped hands) to retrieve the marble. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Yet stakes remain abstract until the climax—laughter and tears gush, but their personal weight isn’t dramatized, slightly muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling ancestral fire with present quietude—is signaled early and deepens when the sonar’s “urgency” forces confrontation. The tightening occurs at the ghost encounter: Lumin must choose between heresy (reviving fire) or reinterpretation (quiet flame). Cost is felt in the elders’ anticipated rejection and the gear’s abandonment—sacrificing certainty for faith. Escalation is protagonist-driven: Lumin follows the pinging, questions the ghost, and reinterprets doctrine; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming private grief into shared language—is signaled early and tightens through Marlow’s nightly returns and culminates in his poem. Agency is clear: he chooses to speak, altering his future carvings. Cost is felt (years of silence, fractured relationships), though escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than causal pressure. Butterfly migration adds texture but doesn’t force tactical shifts; still, the deepening of ancestral stories meaningfully reweights his understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance—is signaled early and tightens when the Hush lengthens and the ridge cracks. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: she chooses interpretation over repair, ritual over force. The cost (“raw” hands, searing reverie) alters tactics by shifting her from technician to mediator. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the rake is discovered, but its meaning must be activated through her deliberate alignment of carvings and runes—a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering buried intentions—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s decoding, which narrows interpretive options until the phrase “The silence between moves” crystallizes meaning. Agency is clear: her tactile choices (tracing threads, rolling the tapestry) drive escalation. Cost is conceptual (carrying knowledge while reburying truth), though a more visceral forfeiture—e.g., sacrificing a personal memory—would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within winter’s constraint—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s nightly star observations and model adjustments. Pressure escalates via social opposition (Elders, blacksmith) and physical toll (cramped hands, bloodshot eyes), narrowing her options to sheer persistence. The equinox thaw is earned by her agency, not luck; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt in her isolation and the quill’s destruction, though the Elders’ silence slightly softens full consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories—is signaled early and deepens when the broadcast shifts from lullaby to dirge, forcing Lira to chase a fading signal with trembling hands. Agency lies in attention and transcription, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt (physical chill, emotional strain) but not visibly altering tactics beyond leaning closer or writing faster. The escalation is textural, not causal, yet the “wind carries secrets, earth keeps them” line reweights her mission with mythic weight, tightening her resolve without narrowing concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the unpreservable—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s ritualistic creation. Her agency drives escalation: grinding charcoal, sprinkling ash, refusing completion. The tightening occurs when she removes the mask, exposing vulnerability, then re-dons it—a renunciation that forecloses safety with tactile cost. The mirage of safety isn’t just stated; it’s tested and rejected through action.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara challenges the cog’s value. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he digs despite mockery, transforming finds into proof. The meaningful tightening occurs when needle and cog mesh, reweighting his mission from delusion to dialogue. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, social alienation, and the risk of being wrong—all foregrounded without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts against cultural erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elias introduces the violin, forcing Clara to act rather than merely mourn. The tightening occurs in her urging him to play despite risk, narrowing options from observation to co-creation. Cost is felt conceptually (the outside world’s hardening borders) and emotionally (Elias’s raw, off-key sob). Agency drives escalation: Clara’s invitation to others stems directly from this shared musical moment, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—pruning away trauma to cultivate beauty—is signaled early and tightens during the alignment peak. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each cut narrows the plant’s neural pathways and her own emotional options. Cost is legible in her physical exhaustion and the discarded violent memories, though the opposition (the plant’s “resistance”) lacks tangible pressure beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—tightens when drone failure reveals the city’s disbelief has tangible consequences. Clara’s agency escalates from passive observation (“wondered why drones hadn’t returned”) to active ignition (“weaponize” candor). Cost is legible: social risk (her pariah status) traded for systemic restoration. The deepening—Voss’s explanation—narrows options to one path: public truth-telling. Coincidence (blackout timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; causality remains protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering vibrant architecture—is signaled early and deepens when the orris root’s power proves real. Escalation occurs through Lira’s agency: she tests her theory by assembling objects, narrowing options from passive noticing to active invocation. Cost is legible in the irreversible sanctification; the bay’s breath-held moment marks a point of no return. Coincidence never resolves—everything stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—halting the oceanic blight—is signaled early and deepened through cascading revelations that narrow Mara’s options: she cannot simply retrieve a cure; she must accept her grandmother’s transformation and become part of the garden’s continuity. Agency is clear: her choice to drink the serum is irreversible and costly (she inherits guardianship). Pressure escalates coherently under the Hybrid lens, with each revelation tightening the moral and tactical frame. The blight’s artificial origin raises ethical stakes beyond mere survival.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the rupture, which forecloses retrieval but enables understanding. Agency drives escalation: Kael chooses violence against the structure, not passive waiting. Cost is felt in the dice’s elusiveness and his relinquishment. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the deepening comes via sensory and symbolic density (April’s four, charcoal proofs, humming bones), though the rupture’s success leans slightly toward convenience without clearer tactical evolution from prior failures.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and deepens when Mr. Voss recognizes his mother. Lila’s agency drives escalation: she chooses vermilion eyes based on his voice, not reference. Cost is felt in lost sleep and emotional exposure. Coincidence (cat’s clang) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn comes from her decision to paint blind.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving art in exile—is signaled early and tightens when Lila decides to host a festival, foreclosing passive curation. The “thaw” acts as both literal and metaphorical pressure point, forcing action before memory melts entirely. Agency is clear: her choice to bake and teach initiates change. Cost is felt in the beekeeper’s vanished hives (symbolizing ecological/cultural collapse) and the persistent dread, though the escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the stone to transcend fate—is signaled early and tightens when the first attempt fails, forcing improvisation with mercury. Agency drives escalation: Elias alters tactics based on observed cog shifts and frayed string. Cost is felt in the stone’s intensified hunger and the physical toll of repeated trials. Coincidence never resolves; the lighthouse’s response emerges from causal feedback, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—confronting fear to break the curse—is signaled early and tightens via the dictionary’s paradox, forcing Mara to welcome what repels her. Agency is clear: her choice to speak the lie drives the reversal. Cost is felt (seared skin, psychological toll of welcoming horror), and the shadow’s dissolution alters the environment permanently. Yet escalation leans slightly on artifact (the dictionary appears conveniently); the “repulsive allure” isn’t tested through failed attempts, reducing tactical depth.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tuning obstacles into harmony—is signaled early and deepens via physical strain (aching arms, raw fingers). Agency drives escalation: each strike aligns with cloud shapes, incorporating seabird cries, apple thuds. Cost is felt (fatigue) and conceptual (faded resonance patterns). One tightening suffices: the pivot at the lightning-scarred tree narrows space and raises stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the watchers move—tightens when the shell cracks, revealing the turtles are alive and hungry. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, plays, chips, enters. Cost is unmistakable: the city’s destruction and her mother’s warning realized. The gate’s rusted state functions as a live clock, narrowing options. One weakness: the watchers’ shift lacks intermediate pressure before their tunnel appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing historical truth from noble lies—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes compromise was possible but suppressed. The meaningful tightening occurs in the tunnel: symbols recontextualize the manifesto’s motifs, narrowing her understanding from “smuggling hub” to “secret negotiation.” Cost is legible in her relinquishment of moral certainty; the lie wasn’t malice but mutual survival, complicating her mission without resolving it neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unearthing interlaced absence—is signaled early and deepens when the chamber reveals her grandmother’s love letters. The meaningful tightening occurs at the hatch: curiosity overrides caution, narrowing options to engagement or retreat. Cost is felt in the tremor of the inkwell and the irreversible act of leaving her own note. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, though the groan borders on convenient if not for prior atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the city fell—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes the blackout was strategic, not accidental. Her agency drives escalation: sketching grooves, aligning the stamp, choosing to take the journal. Cost is visible in her isolation and the irreversible burden of truth. The tightening—from cataloger to truth-bearer—forecloses a return to orderly indexing, crystallizing in her final swim.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief rather than fleeing it—is signaled early and deepens when the brother’s face appears in the gem. The tightening occurs at the climax: she chooses to hold the lantern up, not hide, converting passive sorrow into active witness. Cost is unmistakable: “luminous torment,” brittle laughter, trembling hands. Agency drives escalation; the shadow’s return is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing raw truth through “unused potential”—is signaled early and tightens when the node destabilizes. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she overrides Orion, steps into the vortex, and shatters the geode. Cost is unmistakable: observatory destroyed, past erased, future uncertain. Minor deduction because “perturbation theory” borders on jargon, slightly softening the causal link between method and outcome under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the “frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and deepens when revealed as resonance, not data. Pressure escalates through environmental and sensory cues (hum, drone readings, star alignment), culminating in Lira’s decisive pull of the lever. The cost is felt: she abandons her original mission (mapping infrastructure) for something transcendent, trading certainty for mystery. Agency is maintained throughout; coincidence (pilgrim’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to uphold or break professional deceit—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes Lila’s request masks a deeper erasure. His agency drives escalation: he actively sifts wood, interprets carvings, and renounces fabrication. Cost is felt in the watch’s coldness and the “noose” of unspoken words. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—brokering fragile trust in a broken system—is signaled early and deepened by personal stakes (the children). Clara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to humanize both prisoners forces Elias to reciprocate. The cost is felt in her trembling grip, the unsaid words, and the relinquished talisman. One tightening suffices: the shift from procedural exchange to shared moral reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping regret’s paralysis—is signaled early and deepens when the compass reveals itself as a “measure” of regret, not direction. Clara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to beach at the lighthouse, climb its stairs, and ultimately abandon the compass. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of inherited certainty, though the “chaos is indifferent” insight slightly abstracts the emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming empathy after erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara confronts specific unlived lives. The tightening occurs when she reaches for the mother-image and it shatters, foreclosing easy redemption. Cost is felt: she must carry weight “with grace,” not undo harm. Agency is internal but consequential—her vow to “read the world more carefully” crystallizes stance under pressure, though external opposition remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s paradoxical refusal to let go despite knowing refusal frays the bond entirely. Escalation is driven by her agency: she sings, applies paste, accepts offerings, and finally stops fighting. Cost is unmistakable: “to comply was to lose herself,” realized when her fingers sprout feathers. The tightening occurs at the fox’s feather offering—a point of no return—and culminates in irreversible physical change under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—atonement for perceived abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when the saucer’s crack reveals lost time’s hum. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to trace her palm, unfasten the crack with ink, and climb. Each act narrows options (leaving the glade becomes inevitable) and exacts cost (dissolution of her floating refuge). The mother’s line—“repentance isn’t a place. It’s a choice”—sharpens the moral calculus, making the final descent a renunciation with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—mending reality vs. confronting inner darkness—is signaled early and tightens when the ship nears collapse. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the chamber, face memories, and press her palm to the door. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes grief and love are “twins,” transforming her understanding of peace. Cost is unmistakable: the locket shatters, the door opens irreversibly, and she risks monstrosity to prevent it. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding true transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger reveals her actions fulfill prophecies, reframing her “help” as accidental fate-weaving. The escalation is driven by Lira’s choice to release the final bug, which crystallizes her stance: she’ll keep orchestrating, but now with awareness. Cost is felt—the loss of innocence, the burden of intention—but could be sharper; the stranger’s info arrives cleanly without resistance. Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise: options reconfigured, cost acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sparking silent revolution—is signaled early and deepens via the blackout-as-test revelation. Pressure coheres causally: each beat narrows options (only this sundial, only this quill, only tonight). Agency is clear: protagonists drive decoding, not luck. Cost is conceptual (risk of exposure) and tactical (operating blind), legible in Elara’s “tonight, we finish” and the hidden chamber’s existence. Coincidence complicates (blackout) but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred order—is signaled early and tightens through Lira’s failed sequences, each narrowing options (Fibonacci → Pascal → Möbius). Agency drives escalation: her adjustments provoke eel movement and star-dust surges, culminating in the obsidian placement. Cost is felt in the recurring apocalyptic vision and physical tremors, though the storm threat remains conceptual rather than materialized loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening: realizing patterns reside “in the space between.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—writing uncensored truth—is signaled early and deepens when the cartographer’s poem reframes scars as silence between heartbeats. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to strip metaphors bare, transforming vigil into reckoning. Cost is visible in physical pain and emotional exposure, though the Ministry’s off-page presence slightly softens antagonistic pressure. One meaningful tightening suffices: the envelope’s revelation narrows his path from hiding to raw declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether questions demand answers or journeys—is signaled early and deepens when the tin card transforms from puzzle to map. Agency drives escalation: Kael’s recontextualization forces Elyra’s curious attack, culminating in disarmament that forecloses combat but opens collaboration. Cost is visible (blood, yielded épée) and conceptual (abandoning victory as goal). One tightening suffices, executed with precision under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding self through poetry amid chaos—is signaled early and deepens when Marla reveals her daughter’s incarceration, linking personal and systemic fracture. Cedar’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to show the tin, triggering mutual vulnerability. The cost is conceptual but legible: accepting molting not as loss but as necessary anarchy. Pressure tightens once, coherently, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping fate’s chaos through control—is signaled early and tightens when the film reveals the hidden room, forcing Clara to choose between repair (surface) or refuge (depth). Her agency drives escalation: she ignores compasses, projects the reel, descends. Cost is visible: she abandons her “strategic” identity, leaving the surface piano silent. Coincidence (finding the reel) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to act earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protecting collective memory—is signaled early and tightens when the fracture reveals people forget due to fear of truth. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she demands to see the fracture, triggering the pivotal pool vision. The cost is unmistakable in the oblivion future, and her choice forecloses passive guardianship for active confrontation. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift from empirical observation to dream logic deepens stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering unsaid words—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle locks post-lace-stitching, narrowing options to one course. Agency lies in Lira’s choice to apologize, not in passive discovery. Cost is felt: her admission of blame fractures years of resentment. Escalation is driven by protagonist action (stitching → rowing → speaking), though the ghost’s appearance leans slightly on coincidence, preventing a 9+ score.
