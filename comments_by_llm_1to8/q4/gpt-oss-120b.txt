    The dominant stake—understanding how microscopic patterns influence reality—is signaled early and develops through accumulated observations. However, escalation relies on passive observation rather than active pressure, with no meaningful opposition or cost-bearing choices. The transformation from "tomb to breathing sanctuary" occurs without Mara facing genuine obstacles or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of artistic rebirth is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening through opposition. The journey follows a steady accumulation without reversals or trade-offs; finding the luminous glass shards feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming silence into music after trauma—is clear, but escalation is minimal. The story maintains a steady emotional register without meaningful tightening or deepening; Mara's actions proceed without significant opposition or complication, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—giving rest to haunted souls—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Marlow simply assembles the lens and succeeds; no tightening occurs. The "weight lifting from his shoulders" suggests relief but without prior struggle shown on-page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density, but the beats remain static.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    The sanctions create background pressure but never manifest as concrete obstacles that force specific choices. The "runs" and donations happen without dramatized risk or visible cost, and the border patrols remain an abstract threat that never tests the community's system.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding and releasing unused love—signals early and deepens through breathing techniques that reveal the hidden map. Escalation occurs through accumulation as each breath sharpens the image, though the transition to the luminous tunnel feels abrupt. Cost becomes visible when unused love transforms into "a river of sparks," though agency remains somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of revealing "the texture of time" remains conceptual without concrete test or escalation. No meaningful tightening occurs—the maze simply manifests as designed without opposition or cost. The child's arrival doesn't create pressure that narrows Mara's options or forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—retrieving seeds to prevent famine—is clear and the piano puzzle provides one meaningful tightening that gates progress. However, escalation remains fairly linear without significant reversals or mounting pressure; Mara succeeds at each step without meaningful obstacles beyond the single puzzle, limiting the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake of capturing "the sound of trust breaking" is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening. Mara faces no opposition or complication—she simply executes her plan successfully. While the piece shows her collecting absences and forging them into the device, there's no moment where options narrow or costs become visible beyond abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from stealing moonbeams to discovering the station's chronicle to accepting guardianship. The progression deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—creating safe zones for scientific inquiry during climate crisis—is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure or test. No opposing force challenges Mara's work; she simply crafts vials while narrating to herself without obstacles, setbacks, or meaningful choices that would foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal revelation ("not the fearless hero") through physical danger (collapsing aisle mechanism) to existential choice (accepting vulnerability). The cost is visible when she must betray "the self I had hidden for years." The magical resolution weakens earned pressure but doesn't negate the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes center on creating a map of endless night, but pressure doesn't meaningfully escalate - the storm intensifies externally while the oracle remains in "marbled hush, reverent and still." No tightening forces a choice or trade-off; the oracle completes his task without obstacle or cost beyond the philosophical paradox of mapping the unmappable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where thoughts originate—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The robot succeeds in amalgamating thought with circuitry without sacrifice, trade-off, or visible price; the "looped timelines protocol" provides a convenient solution rather than forcing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake of "thawing mistrust with transparency" is declared but never tested through concrete opposition. No meaningful escalation occurs—Mara simply follows clues, finds equipment, and witnesses transformation without facing resistance or paying a price. The resolution happens to the town rather than through earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes center on proving the garden's awareness through marble polishing, with escalation occurring through accumulation (each polished marble opens new pathways). The dominant stake remains consistent but pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten—the garden responds positively throughout without forcing trade-offs. Cost stays abstract ("blooming withering," "fragile yet fierce triumphs") rather than manifesting as concrete loss or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict or escalation occurs—Lira wants to prove time moves sideways, pulls a lever, and succeeds without opposition, complication, or cost. The "stakes" remain entirely abstract (proving a hypothesis) without dramatized consequences for failure or success beyond recording data.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure builds through accumulating discoveries - water patterns matching program marginalia, glowing staff lines, the final stanza revelation - each deepening Mara's understanding. The stakes (freeing the trapped melody) remain consistent but lack urgent external pressure. The resolution depends on Mara's interpretive action with clear emotional cost in the ghost's release.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the weight of truth—progresses through Mirela's interaction with the botanical illustration and station instruments, with one meaningful deepening when "the console displayed a number that matched the weight of a stone she had been carrying inside." However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful resistance, relying entirely on internal processing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens—Mara enters seeking to appraise the wheel, finds it, "appraises" it through abstract calculation, then leaves. The dominant stake (quantifying truth's weight) never faces concrete test or opposition. His choice to leave the wheel lacks cost or consequence; no options narrow, no trade-offs emerge. The confession about buried chemicals arrives as backstory without creating present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of seeking regenerative silence never faces meaningful opposition or escalation. The keeper's journey through the catacombs proceeds without obstacles—walls narrow, he slips through, reaches the refuge, enters it. No tightening occurs, no options narrow, no cost materializes beyond vague "dissolution" that reverses immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake of creating meaningful connection during the eclipse is signaled early but lacks escalation—the performance proceeds without complications or reversals. No tightening occurs as Liora's plan unfolds exactly as intended. The "cautious exuberance" suggests internal tension but this never manifests as actual conflict or forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the mystery of the displaced axis—is signaled early and deepens through accumulating discoveries (diary line about moon's axis, tapestry dragons' curved necks, wall vibrations, hidden conduit). The resolution occurs through the historian's deliberate investigation with visible transformation (the room "shivers"). However, no meaningful opposition complicates his progress, and the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt through struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure should build through density and pattern, but here the stakes remain conceptual abstractions about "encoded memories" and "hidden truths." The story declares transformation without showing the friction or cost of that change. No meaningful tightening occurs that would foreclose options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake of preventing possession/sealing the veil is declared but never tested through concrete opposition. The ritual progresses without meaningful resistance or complication. While tension builds through accumulation, there's no moment where the priest must sacrifice or choose between competing goods with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density from silent contemplation to the lake singing with color. The dominant stake (becoming conductor of unheard symphonies) tightens as each action—aligning shell, sketching score, commanding "Conduct"—brings closer realization. Cost appears in the fractured horizon and transformed landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract ("conquer the labyrinth of self") without concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The protagonist experiences no visible setbacks or forced trade-offs; he simply progresses through mental corridors while the tablet guides him, lacking the pressure escalation needed even for an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of defeating emotional numbness is clear, with one meaningful deepening as the backward songs shift to forward play. However, the escalation lacks genuine resistance—each step proceeds smoothly toward resolution without complications or meaningful obstacles. The cost of years of numbness is stated but not dramatized through present struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    The quarantine creates an obstacle, but Elara's response lacks genuine pressure or escalation—she simply discovers a convenient solution (the shaft) without struggle or trade-off. No competing options are weighed, no price is paid for her choice. The conflict remains external and logistical rather than forcing any meaningful internal tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding why smells trigger tears) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or opposition. The transformation completes without resistance—Arlen simply receives revelations. No meaningful tightening occurs; the vapor reveals memories but doesn't narrow options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern accumulation and "impossible choices" that multiply as the poet descends. The stakes around preserving versus releasing memory deepen appropriately, but the choices feel more philosophical than urgent—lacking the visceral cost that would push this higher. The final fork presents genuine tension though the resolution's "playful ethic" deflates some earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming silence into story/music—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition. The violinist encounters no resistance when she plays; the transformation happens without struggle or trade-off. While the story deepens through accumulation of imagery, there's no moment where options narrow or the protagonist must choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increase (static mapping emotions, colors forming vortexes, petal saturation). The dominant stake—capturing authentic emotion for commerce—deepens but never truly tightens. No meaningful choice forecloses options; Mara simply executes her established method without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the discovery of the boy's deceased mother presents information without forcing a choice or trade-off. Mara faces no opposition or cost; her decisions (returning the locket, creating the register) encounter zero resistance. The dominant stake remains unclear: is it about connection, community recognition, or completing cycles? Stakes never materialize beyond abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake - achieving community connection - faces no meaningful opposition or complication. The search for the tag proceeds without obstacle, everyone participates harmoniously, and success arrives without trade-off. The "luminescent ache" suggests emotional cost but never manifests as difficulty or resistance that would create genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the pendant's increasing glow and the deepening resonance with the city's heartbeat. However, the escalation feels predetermined rather than contested - Mira faces no genuine obstacles or trade-offs. The "interrupted cadence" pattern provides rhythm but not resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding/transforming loss) never faces real pressure or opposition. The conjurer proceeds through his ritual without obstacles, discoveries that change tactics, or meaningful choices. The "equation" resolves too easily without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of "becoming visible to those who need you" progresses from physical searching through tape discovery to final manifestation, with the outage creating time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.6)
    The central stake—witnessing/facilitating the leaf's transformation—maintains consistency but lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens. The "reluctant metamorphosis" provides texture without genuine opposition; Marlowe's patient observation faces no meaningful obstacles or competing pressures that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake - trading artistic expression for communal renewal - emerges clearly and tightens when the brooch offers its exchange. Cost is visible (surrendering paintings that capture grief), though the escalation feels somewhat predetermined once the brooch appears. The protagonist's agency drives the choice to accept the exchange, satisfying the accumulative lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.1)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—the piece maintains a steady mystical tone without deepening pressure or narrowing options. Stakes remain abstract ("magnify everyday magic") without concrete tests or costs. The pilgrim's "simple prayer for safe passage" resolves without obstacle, and Lira faces no genuine choice point where something must be sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming exile into communal connection through fragment collection—signals early and develops through the valve's transformation from herald to repository. Escalation occurs through density increase as more fragments accumulate, fitting the accumulative lens. However, the pressure lacks urgency; the "distant shout" arrives late without establishing what's at risk if the archivist fails.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress of unspoken truths—progresses through accumulative discovery but lacks genuine opposition or cost. Each obstacle (the locked door, the hidden staircase) yields immediately to the phantom punch without resistance or sacrifice. The protagonist never faces a moment where she must choose between competing values or forfeit something meaningful, reducing the journey to a treasure hunt where every clue cooperates perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through the tile's shifting patterns synchronized with whale migration, forcing Lira to reconcile skepticism with wonder. The stakes deepen as she realizes she's creating "a sanctuary forged from her courageously kind resolve," with visible cost in her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through magnetic pull → spatial mutiny → corridor lattice → twin encounter → dissolution of the amulet → final departure. The immortal's agency drives each transition, though the middle corridor sequence ("Will you stay?") lacks immediate pressure compared to the opening and closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving her lineage to gain asylum—is clear, but escalation remains static as Mara simply waits for the right moment. The story lacks meaningful tightening or deepening beyond the single action of creating the contract, and no visible price is paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    Under the textural lens, pressure accumulates through density increase ("each entry a prism") and pattern ("charting the faint hum"), but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options. The stationer's work continues without obstacle or trade-off; no live option is sacrificed for his choice to document.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - recovering erased histories - escalates through discovery of the label's power to project hidden stories. Meaningful deepening occurs when narrator realizes they're a "conduit for the forgotten." Cost is visible in accepting permanent namelessness, though the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on Selene's quest to decode the "universal riddle" of why myths endure, with accumulative pressure building through the cello's resonance and the seashell's glow. However, the resolution lacks genuine struggle or meaningful obstacles—everything unfolds too cooperatively, from the cello's immediate response to the convenient ledger discovery, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through Mira's discovery-to-action progression, with the dominant stake (preventing privatization) signaled early and tested through concrete reorganization efforts. The tightening occurs when investors arrive to find the community already transformed. Cost manifests in the ongoing vigilance required ("the fight had only begun") though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—photographing the sand grain before it vanishes—faces minimal opposition beyond timing constraints. The chemical countdown provides modest escalation through its five-minute window, but no meaningful tightening occurs. The inspector completes his task without complication or forced trade-offs, and the "tremor of grief" arrives without prior pressure building toward that emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing the drone's wing—progresses steadily but without meaningful complication or reversal. The repair succeeds smoothly ("sealing the tear as seamlessly as a bird's feather mends"), with the only tension being whether the patch will hold, which it does. The ship's departure provides atmospheric pressure but doesn't constrain Mara's choices or create cost beyond the routine challenge of blind repair work.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: condensation forms patterns → reveals "Kaltwasser" → transmitter activates → bell tolls → ice cracks → water emerges. Each layer deepens the dominant stake of mapping origins. The falcon's return triggers action with clear cost in the ice's irreversible breaking, though agency sometimes feels reactive to environmental signs.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reviving the ghost town) faces no meaningful opposition or complication—the tuner's method works exactly as intended without setback or cost. Escalation reads as accumulation of successful restoration rather than increasing pressure. The piece lacks tension because success is guaranteed from the moment the fork touches dust.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—obtaining and sharing the perfume—is clear, but escalation relies on mystical convenience rather than earned pressure. The temple "demands a price" but this feels imposed rather than arising from Mara's choices. The distress signal sacrifice lacks setup—we don't know why she needs rescue or what abandoning it costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes center on the boy's need for redemption from his "cry wolf" legacy, with the hush promising peace, but escalation remains static—he follows the map, finds bodies, and achieves resolution without encountering resistance or having to choose between competing goods. The discovery unfolds without opposition or meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (debt repayment) is clear but escalation reads as repetitive accumulation rather than meaningful tightening. Each ghostly visit follows the same pattern without raising cost or narrowing options. The final transformation arrives through declaration ("In an act that was both tender and fatal") rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of transforming the labyrinth progresses steadily but without meaningful resistance or escalation. The "broken precedents" of old guilds provide token opposition that crumbles without struggle. No concrete cost or trade-off emerges; the weaver's success feels predetermined rather than earned through rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - "restore lost faith" never faces concrete opposition or meaningful complication. The story lacks escalation under the accumulative lens; density doesn't meaningfully increase, and no pattern break forces difficult choices. Resolution arrives through methodical completion rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    The ritual progresses through accumulation (chalk symbols → digital pulses → holographic map → encoded letter) but lacks genuine resistance or complication. No opposing force tests Mara's commitment; the transformation unfolds without obstacles. The deepening from physical mail to "transmission of marginal thoughts" provides the single meaningful shift required.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes around preventing the coup through exposing conspiracies are declared but remain abstract—we never see what the coup would cost the city or what sending the chart risks for the embroiderer. The pattern of flame-reading to stitch-mapping provides texture but no escalating pressure that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - the protagonist performs ritual actions without opposition or cost. The "moment before deciding" never arrives as no actual decision is dramatized. The spirits and moonlight resolve everything externally without the protagonist facing genuine struggle or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming trauma into healing—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening or reversal. The child's awakening provides minimal complication, and the translator faces no resistance to her healing work. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds modestly through layered metaphors, but no option is foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the artist paints, people watch appreciatively, and she continues painting. The dominant stake (bringing joy through art) never faces genuine opposition or complication. The resolution arrives through completion rather than through pressure that forces a choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—signals early and deepens through the garden's responsive awakenings. Pressure coheres as each reflection "unlocked a deeper curiosity that pulled at her certainty like a tide," though escalation remains primarily internal and conceptual rather than forcing concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—protecting free thought from taxation—is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. Dr. Mirabel's entrance creates momentary tension that deflates immediately when she joins without conflict. No meaningful escalation occurs; the "converging chaos" is declared rather than dramatized through rising pressure or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The poet encounters no setback, no failed attempt, no cost to his centuries of work. The postcard arrives as pure gift, the verses flow without struggle, and success comes without sacrifice, violating the requirement for "one meaningful tightening, deepening, or cadence shift" that would create pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving forgotten names/feelings) maintains coherent pressure through accumulative ritual. The traveler's arrival provides meaningful deepening as the preserved work finds purpose. However, escalation remains gentle rather than intensifying—the ritual repeats without increasing resistance or complication until the validating arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes center on restoring the archive's voice with time pressure ("before paths diverge"), but escalation remains gentle—each glyph unfolds without genuine resistance or cost to Elara. The conflict lacks a meaningful tightening that would force trade-offs; success arrives through patient method rather than struggle that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake of harmonizing conflicting values is signaled early and resolved through Mira's technical solution.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs through mapping—remains consistent but static. While the story describes weeks of trust-building with pigeons, no specific moment shows Lila risking failure or choosing between competing goods; the progression feels predetermined rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern recognition and spatial exploration, but lacks meaningful tightening. The child's discoveries (hidden seam, spiral corridor, maps) progress without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options. The resolution arrives through understanding rather than contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of belonging"—progresses through accumulation (fireflies multiply, holographic constellations appear) but lacks meaningful tightening or foreclosed options. The resolution comes too easily through playing instruments without visible trade-offs or resistance from the "lingering spirits" initially mentioned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—faces no meaningful opposition or escalating pressure. Maren progresses through discoveries without setbacks, trade-offs, or narrowing options. The resolution arrives through accumulation rather than conflict, and while fitting the textural lens, lacks the tightening that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the performer executes a series of acts (juggling, riddles, chess piece placement, violin) without rising pressure or narrowing options. The dominant stake of transforming randomness into harmony faces no opposition or complication. Cost remains abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—creating an eternal verse—faces no real opposition or complication beyond Lira needing to "fledge her own limits." The story lacks escalating pressure; she simply executes her plan without meaningful obstacles, and the "gaps between the tide's rhythm" present technique rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful conflict or escalation occurs—Mira performs her ritual, observes patterns, feels gratified, and leaves. The story declares stakes about finding "value in the mundane" but never tests this through opposition, choice, or cost; the protagonist's goal is achieved without struggle, complication, or any tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine escalation occurs—Maren walks, reflects, places the box, picks it up, returns to town, opens it. The "bargain" never manifests as active pressure. The villagers' "bargained innocence" appears without setup, and the magical light resolution bypasses earned conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from fixing a broken gauge to revitalizing communal faith through visible equations of hope. The progression through trial balloons to festival proposal shows meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost becomes legible as villagers invest their hopes in physical balloons. Some softness in how "parallel timelines" function reduces tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering wall dreams) deepens through film discovery and pressing negative to stone, forcing Lira to accept the legacy's weight. The transformation from burden to communion represents meaningful deepening with cost ("weight of history settle like warm ash"). However, the extended denouement after natural closure reduces pressure, and the final communal section lacks the intensity of earlier discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming mirrors to show possibilities—remains static rather than escalating. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases through layered imagery but no meaningful tightening occurs. The bells provide a deadline but don't force harder choices or reveal new costs.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (ending war through negotiation) is clear but faces no meaningful opposition or complication—chieftains acquiesce after hearing terms without dramatized resistance. No escalation occurs; the ritual proceeds smoothly from clipboard placement to sword surrender. The "price of redemption" is declared but never tested through concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving an echo of extinction through the very drought that caused it—builds through the approach to the basin, the unsealing ritual, and the egg's fracture. The cost is legible in the "fragment of grace forged from cruelty," though the middle section could tighten the pressure more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes center on breaking conformity's hold, with escalation through the untangling sequence releasing increasingly powerful echoes. The tightening occurs when "the final thread loosen[s], a golden strand pulsing like a sunrise trapped in ice." Cost remains somewhat abstract—we see the city transform but not what the courtesan specifically sacrifices beyond her presence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Selene enters seeking epiphanies, arranges dishes, watches fire glow, and leaves with the same intentions. The "revelation" about puppet strings creates no pressure or cost, and her plan to continue puppet shows remains unchanged from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake - honoring forgotten histories - never faces genuine opposition or complication. Lira proceeds through her ritual without obstacles, reversals, or tightening pressure. The monarchs pass, she builds her structures, they glow - but no force tests her commitment or extracts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—escalates from personal mission to communal legacy when the traveler adds Eira's name, showing how each addition "added another thread to the rope's luminous tapestry." The tightening occurs through Mara's physical struggle with the rope yielding names, though the middle lacks a clear moment of heightened resistance or cost before success.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to forest-wide renewal as the protagonist's actions trigger the directive's rewriting. The storm provides external pressure while internal conflict between seeing past/future but never present creates tension. The vortex sequence represents meaningful deepening as consciousness transcends "limits of linear time," though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—binding mortal intent with celestial will—is signaled early and maintains coherence. Pressure builds through the astronomical alignment and ritual preparation. However, escalation lacks genuine obstacles; Nabu proceeds from discovery to activation without meaningful resistance, and the covenant seals without demanding a visible price or forcing a difficult choice.

    Stakes center on transforming the monks' resentment through Mara's scheme. The escalation through each monk's transformation builds accumulative pressure effectively. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition—the monks offer no resistance, making the transformation feel too easy despite the visible emotional cost of releasing long-held grudges.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early but escalation remains linear without reversal or complication. The synchronized breathing deepens from matching "rustle of dead leaves" to forging "a silent pact," but Arlen faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; success arrives without forcing him to sacrifice or choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the ribbon snag is a minor inconvenience immediately resolved, and the quartz mending proceeds without resistance or complication. The dominant stake (repairing the lenses) faces no opposition or tightening pressure. Cost remains abstract ("fractured quartz," "breach of contract") without concrete consequences that alter tactics or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes center on obtaining forbidden knowledge through the pistachio shell cameo, with pressure building through cryptic responses and the requirement to surrender linear thinking. The revelation sequence in bathrooms provides some escalation, but agency remains primarily receptive (receiving visions, accepting paradoxes) rather than driving choices with visible trade-offs or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative discoveries (gaps → chord → cavern → library), with each finding narrowing Selene's path toward the unlearned lessons. The cost becomes legible when she must offer the diary's missing page and promise to record portal coordinates, though the tension could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through verse-gathering and narrative thread-weaving, with the dominant stake (finding the garden) tightening as "each captured line glowed on the emerald swatch card." The transformation from derelict to moving ship shows meaningful deepening, though agency remains somewhat passive - discovery rather than hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity—progresses through the rope-weaving sequence, but escalation remains gentle. The story lacks a moment where Mara must sacrifice something tangible or face genuine opposition; the door yields too easily to her methodical approach.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes center on restoring quiet to the caves, but this remains abstract without clear consequences for failure. The energy beings provide initial pressure that dissipates rather than escalates. The mapkeeper faces no meaningful opposition or cost in obtaining the stone - the ice simply "sighs" and reveals the path, undermining tension that should build toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (proving meaning exists) remains static until the caravan arrives, providing minimal escalation. The rekindling succeeds without complication or cost beyond patience, and the "forgotten network of towers" revelation arrives without the protagonist's agency, deflating earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens. The archivist observes, measures, records, and contemplates without facing opposition or making choices that narrow options. The "conjecture" about collective memory never meets resistance or requires trade-offs. Stakes remain abstract ("to sculpt identity from experience") without concrete tests or visible prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of defying hopelessness through art is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. The fireworks burst and illuminate the mosaic, but this occurs without resistance or trade-off—no genuine tightening narrows options. The "gravity of hopelessness" remains an abstract concept rather than dramatized pressure that forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - the chronicler observes without facing opposition or making choices that narrow options. The clan conflict happens off-page without testing the protagonist. Stakes remain abstract (understanding "texture of time") without concrete pressure or cost that would force character-revealing decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lio's need to escape claustrophobic limitation through silence collection—is clear early. Gravity inversion provides the tightening constraint with its one-hour window. However, escalation feels predetermined rather than contested; no genuine resistance or complication challenges Lio's ascent or collection, reducing tension despite the poetic accumulation of silence flavors.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure accumulates through the storm glass vial's color changes (amber to silver cascade) creating a rhythm Lira must respond to. The dominant stake - creating comfort through silence - deepens once when the vial "bursts into cascade," forcing Lira's final teaching moment. Cost registers as depletion ("purpose spent") but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    The sunrise deadline creates nominal urgency but never pressures Mina's choices—she proceeds smoothly from discovery to ascension without obstacles or meaningful resistance. The throne "accepts her" without testing commitment or extracting cost, making the resolution feel unearned despite the quest framework.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—teaching suffocating darkness to breathe—maintains coherence but lacks meaningful escalation. The keeper's actions (approaching threshold, tapping with ring, stepping through) progress linearly without resistance or complication. No genuine opposition tests his commitment, making the transformation feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal wariness through testing the quantum promise to establishing a new covenant, with pressure cohering around trust versus exploitation. The transformation carries cost, though the middle section lacks a sharp reversal or complication that would heighten the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (uncovering family truth) is clear from the start. Pressure builds through the gramophone sequence leading to scroll discovery, with one meaningful deepening when the confession reveals betrayal rather than military defeat. However, there's minimal resistance or complication - the discovery unfolds too smoothly without testing Lian's commitment or forcing difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries that deepen the knight's engagement: program → control panel → moss stage → final binding. Each step narrows his path from observer to participant with increasing cost. The transformation from "withdrawn knight" to one who makes "murmured allegiance" to possibility itself shows clear stakes, though middle beats could tighten the pressure between discovery and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—"magnifying small kindnesses" and "honoring histories" never face concrete opposition or require trade-offs. The supervisor's immediate agreement removes potential conflict without cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ending simply extends the pattern established at the beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on broadcasting truth against an indifferent regime, with pressure building through Mara's resourceful navigation and the transmission's ripple effects. The story delivers one meaningful intensification when the broadcast awakens dormant resistance. However, the regime's response remains abstract—they must "confront ghosts" but face no immediate retaliation or concrete countermoves.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy's apocalyptic fulfillment—is signaled early and maintains coherence. However, escalation under the textural lens relies mainly on accumulating imagery rather than genuine tightening of options. The resolution through playing saxophone meets no meaningful opposition, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - decoding the forest's message - intensifies through accumulation as each discovery (leaf patterns, underground spring, luminous script) deepens Lira's connection. The transformation carries visible cost in her permanent alteration ("forever changed"). However, the pressure lacks resistance or complication; everything unfolds too smoothly without meaningful obstacles that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through textural density as Mara follows the compass deeper, each discovery narrowing her path—from workshop to greenhouse to waterfall to hidden cavern. The dominant stake (embracing uncertainty versus seeking control) intensifies through physical descent. The cost manifests when she abandons her original craft's precision for improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the weight of names through repairing the coin—escalates from measurement to action to transformation. The crack widening "just enough" shows genuine risk, and the gold sealing creates irreversible change. However, the external pressure from the search party's departure lacks concrete consequence, keeping this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from hearing whispers to achieving clearer speech to discovering laughter as the missing element. The pressure deepens when Mara must offer genuine laughter "with true intent," though the goat joke resolution lacks the weight of earlier buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the forest demands "a price" through violet light that "seared her skin," this remains the only concrete pressure point, and Lira endures it without visible struggle or tactical adjustment. The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—never faces genuine opposition or requires sacrifice beyond accepting painful light.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern recognition (paintings converging with fragment's glow) and the unfolding revelation of the silver chain. However, the resolution lacks genuine obstacle or resistance—the translation succeeds without meaningful complication or forced trade-off that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering what the ceiling hides—progresses through Mara's methodical investigation, but lacks meaningful tightening or resistance. The ghosts cooperate immediately, the hatch opens easily, and the ledger appears without obstacle, creating insufficient pressure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure: whisper seeps into ink, library shivers, books unfurl, reality reconfigures. The dominant stake (compressing eternity) faces one meaningful deepening when "rustling awakenings erupted in a cascade." However, Mara achieves her goal without visible price—the "rupture" brings only positive transformation, undermining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.9)
    The central conflict over the shard's meaning sets clear stakes, but resolution comes through Lira's uncontested plan rather than escalating pressure. The dispute vanishes without resistance once the light show begins, lacking the tightening or deepening that would demonstrate genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the midnight deadline and the covenant's response to Alder's work, with pressure building from "sorrowful note" to potential collapse to renewal. The cost remains somewhat abstract ("reclaim the light stolen by midnight") rather than viscerally felt through specific losses.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Mara descends deeper, with the water staircase representing a literal threshold that requires commitment. The dominant stake (finding where explanations fail) tightens when the compass dissolves into the vortex, forcing acceptance rather than discovery, though agency feels somewhat passive in the mystical sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.8)
    No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs—Mira faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, encounters no obstacles. The "magic" of the lantern slide creates visions but doesn't force choices or narrow options. The sculpture's creation proceeds without complication, and visitor appreciation arrives without cost or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered imagery (postcards → glass → hidden garden), but the revelation arrives through passive observation rather than earned struggle. The emotional cost registers in tears and the release of "cold doubts," though this transformation lacks the resistance that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from finding letters to decoding the diary's retrocognitive trap to negotiating with sand-carvers to descending to the lagoon. Each stage narrows options and deepens commitment. The final broadcast carries visible cost as "every dune trembled" - though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain conceptual throughout—the town needs revival, but no urgency or opposition pressures the alchemist's work. The amber bottle opens through "question" and "recollection" without resistance or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; the resurrection proceeds smoothly from conception to completion without complication or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving versus preventing the prophesied destruction—emerges but lacks escalating pressure after the prophecy's discovery. Harel's response feels contemplative rather than pressured; no meaningful tightening forces a harder choice. The resolution arrives through understanding rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative intensification: vortex deepens → ice melts to singing mist → phoenix gains centuries of heat → time scatters as crystal snowflakes → seed planted transforms atrium. The dominant stake (reopening the ancient covenant) faces meaningful pressure through the "precise method by decreasing entropy." Cost manifests in Mira's permanent transformation into guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on transforming how the sanctuary responds to storms, with clear escalation from mechanical installation through sensor calibration to the successful first test at "zero hour." The protagonist's agency drives each step—choosing the sensor threshold, timing the adhesive cure, connecting the new cable. Cost is visible when the old system is retired and the risk of misreading "the breath of the clouds" is acknowledged, though tension could be heightened.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding strength through vulnerability while empathizing with falling stars—establishes early but lacks meaningful escalation. The tremor response and chord resonance deepen texture but don't narrow options or force trade-offs. No visible cost appears beyond accepting vulnerability, which reads more as enlightenment than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the covenant's silence to prevent catastrophic release—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through the ghosts' increasing visibility and alignment with the box's patterns, culminating in the recluse's choice to maintain rather than break the covenant. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; the recluse never genuinely considers breaking the covenant, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes center on Mara's borrowed time and need to unlock the capsule's purpose "before the last grain of sand slipped through." The pressure deepens through accumulative discoveries rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens. However, the resolution lacks tangible cost—while Mara achieves understanding, we don't see what her "borrowed time" status costs her or what she sacrifices for this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing discord between wind and water—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. The poet's verses succeed without meaningful resistance; the "kite string snaps" moments introduce ripples but no escalating pressure. No option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The six-month death sentence establishes clear stakes, and the copper-wrapping project creates accumulative pressure as visitors feel "subtle pressure in their chests" and children begin sketching the trees. However, the conflict lacks meaningful tightening—Mara proceeds without obstacles, and her approaching death simply evaporates when the council arrives. The resolution through mysterious vitality transfer rather than earned trade-off weakens the escalation's payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of understanding "chemistry of homecoming" faces one meaningful deepening when the alien echo responds to the amber's glow, forcing Arin's reconception. However, escalation remains gentle under the accumulative lens, and the cost (dimmed amber, shift in understanding) lacks visceral pressure despite being conceptually present.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—healing war's damage through ancient knowledge—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The seeds simply work when scattered; no tightening occurs as the coachman encounters no obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs that would force a harder choice or reveal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the cylinder to recovering the mythic leaf to accepting the burden of carrying voices. The progression tightens through riddle-solving and physical searching, though agency feels somewhat passive as Rook follows instructions rather than making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—finding direction in a fractured reality—is signaled early and deepens when the temporal glimpse reveals ancestral connection. However, escalation remains primarily internal without concrete opposition or trade-offs; the protagonist faces no resistance to continuing the sketching ritual or navigating the deck's temporal field.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (amending the curse) signals early and escalates through accumulating exchanges. Each chess piece swap deepens pressure as "ice beneath his boots seemed to soften." However, no genuine reversal or complication tests commitment—the ritual proceeds without meaningful opposition or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory of small gestures during crisis—remains coherent throughout. Mira's pattern-walking creates tangible pressure that unlocks the scroll compartment. However, escalation plateaus after the scroll discovery; the second pattern ("heal") lacks the causal weight of the first, and the penumbra's assistance reduces Mira's agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory accretion: stone's vibration → dream-scapes → feather reading → hidden corridor → mercury book → scent memories. The dominant stake (finding home's shape) tightens when painful memories shatter "like glass into shards of doubt," forcing confrontation. Cost registers in accepting home as ephemeral resonance rather than physical shelter, though the transformation could land with more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of self-forgiveness is signaled early and maintained throughout. The labyrinth provides escalating internal pressure, but the conflict lacks external resistance or meaningful obstacles beyond the protagonist's own guilt, making the resolution feel somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes center on achieving forgiveness through art, but escalation remains static—the poetry sessions grow "louder" without meaningful complication or tightening. The price of forgiveness shifts from abstract concept to "shared memory and humility" without dramatized struggle or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal uncertainty to world-repair through the alchemist's growing narrative power—each spoken line literally stitches light across stone. The acid sea's threat ("trying to dissolve the workshop's foundations") creates genuine pressure against her restorative work. Cost manifests in "surrendering fear" and the visible transformation of doubt into resolve that "shone as fiercely as the acid-fumed sunrise."

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake of finding "temporary eternity" is signaled early and tested through the cave discovery and shell revelation. The escalation from broken mirror to cave exploration to finding the key provides one meaningful deepening that changes the painter's options. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure—the painter faces no real opposition or difficult trade-offs, and the resolution arrives through discovery rather than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—manifests through the fisherman's arrival but lacks escalating pressure or meaningful obstacles. No competing forces challenge Mara's belief; the resolution arrives without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on mapping loss and enabling return, with escalation through the navigator's building of the map-making engine that "could translate loss into audible currents." The arrival of ships confirms success but lacks a moment where the navigator must choose between competing goods or face a genuine test. Cost appears in "the weight of every name" but remains somewhat abstract rather than forcing a concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—using the glass eye to create psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when Mara must reveal her true intentions. Her agency drives the escalation through hiding the eye and confronting the smugglers. However, the smugglers' immediate capitulation lacks earned resistance, and the conflict resolves too smoothly without testing Mara's commitment through meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's message—remains static rather than escalating through accumulated pressure. While Marlowe's investigation progresses from observation to understanding, no meaningful tightening occurs; the "gaps" discovery doesn't force a choice or create visible cost beyond abstract comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of fulfilling the promise builds through discovery of the chip and following the ants, creating one meaningful deepening when the doorway materializes. Yet the escalation lacks resistance—everything unfolds too smoothly without genuine obstacles or moments where failure seems possible, reducing tension despite the mystical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—progresses through physical ascent and discovery but lacks meaningful tightening or cost. The queen faces no opposition or difficult choices; she simply follows the map to the orb. The resolution comes through magical absorption without trade-offs or visible price beyond vague future responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing ephemeral presence as tangible light—is established early but lacks escalation under pressure. The experiment succeeds on first attempt without complication: "When the first brush touched the liquid, it sparked a ripple." No meaningful tightening occurs; the only development is friends adding "a dash of their own breath" which deepens participation but doesn't raise cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming chaotic visions into narrative—remains consistent but lacks meaningful escalation. The grave discovery creates initial pressure, but no tightening occurs; the narrator continues writing and dreaming without narrowing options. The resolution (stepping outside to "soar again") releases rather than intensifies pressure, and no visible cost accompanies the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—unveiling ordinary miracles through repair work—remains static throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs; Lena begins and ends in the same emotional register of "reverent fingers" and "quiet work" without facing resistance or making trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming painful scars into healing stories—is established early but lacks escalating pressure. The ritual proceeds without complication or resistance; no force opposes Lira's intention, and the transformation occurs without meaningful tightening or a moment where success seems uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (delivering the apology before trees fall) has urgency but minimal escalation—the ritual proceeds smoothly with the sheet music conveniently providing the exact apology needed. No meaningful obstacles or trade-offs emerge; the "induced currents" simply work without cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - "unravel cosmic illusions" and "unify disparate strands" lack concrete consequence. The spiral arbitration provides textural escalation but no clear cost emerges until the vague "aching peace" at closure, which doesn't specify what was lost or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure builds through accumulation of measurement rituals and counting backwards, with the key moment when "the hydraulic system released a gentle sigh" marking the crystallization point. Stakes remain primarily philosophical rather than urgent, lacking a concrete opposing force or clear consequence for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain abstract - "revolutionizing protection" lacks concrete opposition or cost. The storm threat provides brief external pressure but resolves too easily. No meaningful escalation occurs under the accumulative lens; the protagonist succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off, and the "quiet wildfire" remains metaphorical rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—proving probability can embrace chance—is declared but never tested through genuine risk or loss. Mara's journey underground faces no meaningful obstacles; each cryptic scrawl yields immediately to her interpretation without cost or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on transforming isolation into connection through accumulated wrong-number calls, with Lena's call providing the key deepening that shifts the pattern. The cost of Mara's cultivated estrangement becomes legible when she steps out, though escalation relies more on accumulation than active pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - the archivist performs the same contemplative actions throughout without rising pressure or narrowing options. The covenant's renewal happens without opposition or cost. Stakes remain entirely abstract (preserving memories) without concrete tests or consequences that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes around curing loneliness remain somewhat abstract until the moon rock's discovery. The ivy-cutting requirement creates one concrete obstacle, but escalation plateaus rather than tightens. Cost becomes visible in the reciprocal sharing obligation but lacks visceral pressure throughout the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic as musical notes intensify from "trail of musical notes" to "hidden melody" to "single pure tone that seemed to freeze the air." The stillpoint discovery represents meaningful deepening rather than reversal, with cost visible in the dissolution of her accumulated languages into "one harmonious chord," though the internal nature of the conflict limits dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—"failed experiment" and "chaos" lack specificity, and the resolution arrives without meaningful resistance or cost. The anomaly applies pressure but the protagonist solves the problem through passive observation of the pen's magic rather than choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)

The ritual proceeds without obstacle, and Lira's continuation lacks any trade-off or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the trail of artistic discoveries leading to the mentor's promise, with each fragment adding meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming sterile despair into shared hope—escalates through Lira's drumming intensifying from "tapping" to creating "shockwaves," but the opposition remains abstract. The researchers' transformation happens too easily without dramatized resistance or concrete obstacles to Lira's rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (proving whispers travel farther) is signaled early but never seriously threatened—Milo methodically follows clues to inevitable success. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; each discovery leads smoothly to the next without cost or trade-off. The challenge lacks opposition or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    No real conflict or escalation - the guardian performs its task without opposition or complication. The "stillwater tension" is declared but never tested through actual pressure that would force choices. Stakes remain abstract (teaching darkness about stars) without concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict exists - the "rebellion" faces zero opposition. The synchronized windows spread without obstacle, the mayor converts without resistance, and the community transforms without any stakes being tested. The story declares a "humble rebellion" but never dramatizes what's being rebelled against or what cost this rebellion extracts.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through Mara's progression from hearing the whale's call to stepping onto the dock to singing the hymn that reveals the island. The dominant stake (freedom vs. protection) crystallizes when she must choose to release the scrimshaw. However, the "day after violence became impossible" premise creates stakes that feel abstract rather than immediately pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake of creating art under enforced happiness lacks concrete pressure—no enforcement appears, no consequences threaten. Mara's whittling proceeds without opposition or complication. The "morally ambiguous purpose" never faces a test that would force trade-offs or demonstrate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes center on dissolving "boundaries once thought sacred," but pressure remains steady rather than escalating. The "tremor of certainty" repeats without deepening into higher cost or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Selene's quest to perceive color despite colorblindness—escalates through accumulated plant arrangements, each revealing new hues that build toward her acceptance of "imperfect grace." The tension between seeking "perfect symmetry" and discovering "cracked, asymmetrical grace" creates meaningful pressure. Cost is visible in her abandonment of perfection-seeking, though the conflict could deepen further through more resistance or failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—establishing connection with the artificial mind—is signaled early and progresses through accumulated sensory responses. However, escalation lacks meaningful tightening or trade-offs; each chime simply adds to the effect without forcing difficult choices or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - the cartomancer performs the same contemplative actions (spreading cards, measuring, recording) without rising pressure or narrowing options. The "faint humming" and "droplet reflected a miniature universe" arrive without causal weight or cost, functioning as atmospheric flourishes rather than stakes-driven developments.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge by breaking patterns—is clear, and the historian's irregular steps create tension. However, escalation remains flat after he reaches the pagoda; the revelation of star maps and other seekers arriving doesn't meaningfully tighten pressure or force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope through capturing shadows—lacks concrete pressure or escalation. The protagonist observes footage, places a stone, watches it glow, then declares success without facing meaningful opposition or making difficult choices. No tightening occurs; the "shadow unbound" presents no resistance or cost to capture.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - "reconstructing trust" and "balance between self-respect and compassion" never face concrete tests. The con's impact stays vague, and Mara's response (arranging objects, whispering to a chameleon) carries no risk or cost. No meaningful escalation occurs under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from personal scar-reading to accessing the displaced miracle through the ritual alignment of hourglass and coffee rings. The moss's telepathic guidance provides pressure that narrows options toward the specific ritual action, though the resolution comes too easily without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density—from finding the film strip to discovering letters to the final release of stored love. The progression deepens through "each turn expanding the space around her like rooms opening into galaxies," though agency remains somewhat passive (discovery rather than choice).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict emerges - the dreamer performs his ritual without opposition, complication, or meaningful resistance. The "trapped creativity" never fights back or demands sacrifice. Stakes remain abstract ("unspoken words," "trapped creativity") without visceral consequence. The story lacks even one reversal or tightening that would narrow options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—cultivating sparks to restore life after devastation—progresses through the guard's active use of the chess clock and charms, with visible results in the light-trees. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance or complication; success comes too easily without genuine struggle or trade-offs that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory layering and the gear's translocation ability, culminating in the engine's awakening. However, the stakes remain primarily internal and abstract—there's no concrete opposition or meaningful trade-off. The philosopher achieves his goal without sacrificing anything tangible, limiting the conflict's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (finding courage) develops through accumulation - the leash breaking, the indirect journey, the cave discovery. However, escalation relies more on symbolic deepening than concrete pressure. The "gently persistent" waiting and the map discovery provide texture but lack urgent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.2)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the bolt placement triggers a color shift but doesn't narrow options or force choices. The story declares stakes about "the cost of safety" but never tests them through concrete pressure. The guests' "fleeting sense of unity" arrives without conflict or trade-off, and their emergence with "new understanding" happens through summary rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and maintains coherence. Escalation occurs through the pellet's revelation, the cryptic map, and the crown confrontation, with the temple's collapse providing a meaningful tightening. However, the spectral pretender's emergence lacks earned resistance, and the resolution feels predetermined rather than hard-won through the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) is signaled early but never faces real pressure—the discovery arrives through patient observation rather than struggle or sacrifice. No meaningful tightening occurs; the revelation doesn't force a choice between competing goods or require trading anything valuable. Cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes center on whether dormant potential (in machines and people) can reignite without destructive rebellion. The stone's hum escalates from personal query to collective awakening, though agency feels diluted when the circle does most of the work. Cost appears in "reluctant vigor" and the acceptance of "relentless" responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen from personal discovery to communal transformation as the embryo's "implanted destiny" binds to Anara's will. The sacrifice of memory provides concrete cost, though additional pressure points before the ritual would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to live with catastrophic trauma—is clear but remains static throughout. There's no meaningful escalation or tightening; the protagonist moves through the space processing the same grief without encountering new pressure or obstacles that would force adaptation or deeper choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure accumulates through textural intensification (walls closing, luminescent ache, descent into darkness) but lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses options. The transformation from crestfallen artist to one who embraces fragmentation occurs without sufficient resistance or visible trade-off—the "necessary darkness" proves too easily navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens—the story maintains a single contemplative register throughout without tightening pressure or forcing trade-offs. The "discovery" about time slowing is delivered through exposition rather than earned through conflict, and no options narrow or costs accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from Maren's individual act to realm-wide awakening, with the letter's encrypted sigil creating irreversible spread through the networks.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake of rebuilding community after catastrophe is clear, but escalation remains flat. Lira's actions (whispering to plants, distributing petals) face no meaningful opposition or complication. The boy with the broken compass provides minor tension that resolves too easily without genuine cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.6)
    Under the Accumulative lens, there's one meaningful deepening when "patterns break themselves" and the fisher connects with the echo. However, the stakes remain abstract—we understand he seeks the goddess's echo but not what failure would cost him or what success truly changes beyond acquiring mystical knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (exposing corruption) is signaled early but escalation occurs through convenient discovery rather than protagonist struggle. The console accepting the pen nib and instantly solving the cipher eliminates tension rather than tightening it. No meaningful reversal or cost forces Mira to sacrifice anything substantial for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—silencing guilt through the amber's properties—faces no meaningful opposition or escalation. Lyra simply follows instructions found in letters without obstacles, setbacks, or competing pressures. The "haunted firmware" presents as antagonistic but yields immediately to the amber's influence without struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure accumulates through the mandala's creation and the tile's response, with one meaningful deepening when "unlearning" shifts from erasing to shedding assumptions. However, the stakes remain abstract—we never see what specific assumptions constrain Liora or what she risks by releasing them.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—forging "aberrant mercy" that can survive cold logic—escalates from personal mission to collective transformation as crowds gather and the plaza becomes a pilgrimage site. The cost is legible in the "warm coldness" that doesn't heal but transforms grief, though agency feels somewhat passive after the initial renaming act.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—the ghost's need for "one final encore"—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The ghost performs, the orchard responds positively, and resolution arrives through the shopkeeper's convenient wish without the ghost sacrificing anything concrete. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ghost's actions don't foreclose options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can prove "neural resonance" without drugs—progresses through a single experimental sequence without meaningful opposition or tightening. The "faint whisper of another mind" arrives without struggle or cost, and no option is foreclosed when she succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes build through accumulation: fossil activation → water vapor rising → cave walls shimmering → final network pulse. The dominant stake (becoming voice of the unknown) deepens when she discovers it means amplifying rather than speaking. Cost appears in her year-long wait, though the pressure could tighten more decisively in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on decoding the prophecy to enable time's reversal. Escalation occurs through accumulation—each button adds a fragment, building toward the climactic arrangement. The pressure tightens when buttons must be arranged "in the shape of a river." Cost appears in Mara's acceptance of her role as keeper. One meaningful deepening occurs, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.9)
    While the internal journey from guilt to redemption is clear, external pressure remains absent—no opposing force tests the spy's resolve or forces trade-offs. The "unused courage" revelation that it's "not a place but a state" deflates rather than escalates stakes, and the transformation lacks a concrete cost beyond drinking mystical water.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Arlen waits, meditates, then departs when fog lifts naturally. The dominant stake of understanding the river never faces opposition or requires trade-offs. Agency reduces to passive awareness without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding why places resist change) remains intellectual rather than visceral, with minimal escalation—Mara simply observes and follows patterns without facing opposition or meaningful obstacles. The "thrum" intensifying represents textural deepening but lacks the narrowing of options or forced trade-offs that would create genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—bringing light to darkness—signals early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density increase or pattern break, but here the vines simply grow as intended. The "quivering hush" shifts to steady breath without resistance or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (translating isolation into independence) is signaled early but escalation remains flat—Mira performs the ritual without meaningful opposition or tightening pressure. The awakening of scripts and appearance of the sky-whale ghost add texture but don't force trade-offs or narrow options. No visible cost manifests beyond abstract "brittle awakenings."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens. Mira approaches spiral, whispers into it, steps on it, catches a petal, whispers again—each action flows without resistance or complication. The "thread tightening" and "cascade of silver light" are ornamental responses, not pressure that narrows options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes center on preventing chaos through signal interference, with one meaningful tightening when the tricksters attempt their false alarm. However, the resolution feels too neat—the subsonic pattern effortlessly transforms panic into unity without dramatized struggle. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt through specific losses or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake of finding the key progresses through spatial manipulation, but escalation remains mechanical—walls move, passage opens, key retrieved. The claustrophobic pressure whispers but never truly threatens, and the "weight of centuries" lifting lacks dramatized cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving cold cases through art—remains abstract throughout, never facing concrete tests or obstacles. No meaningful escalation occurs; Mara simply paints while the quarry mystically responds. The resolution arrives through supernatural intervention (stone cracking, revealing names) rather than protagonist agency confronting opposition with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of honoring the ancestor escalates through discovery (nail location), threat (incoming vortex), and resolution (protecting/embedding the nail). Mara's agency drives each turn, from decoding verses to rallying the crew. However, the vortex arrives conveniently as external pressure rather than arising from character choices, and the stakes feel abstract since we never understand what dishonor the ancestor actually faced.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict exists - the fiddler encounters zero opposition to his quest. The "pixelated amnesty" operates as abstract concept rather than dramatized stakes. The protagonist simply performs prescribed actions (climb mountain, play fiddle) without cost, resistance, or meaningful choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace endless loops or measured boundaries—emerges clearly but escalation remains conceptual rather than pressurized. The startup's rise and fall happens in summary ("clients withdrew, servers stalled") without dramatized cost. Arlen's agency manifests primarily through observation and gentle persuasion rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"shared burdens" and "hidden knowledge" never manifest as concrete pressures requiring difficult choices. The dominant stake (decoding temple inscriptions) faces no opposition or complication; Mara simply follows cosmic hints to inevitable success. No meaningful tightening occurs, and the resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the druid executes her plan without opposition or complication. The confession shatters exactly as intended, the seed behaves as expected, and the vortex unwinds on cue. Stakes remain abstract (guarding truth) without concrete cost or trade-off that would create tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the covenant to guide her people—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or escalation. The maze yields too easily to her touch, the visions arrive without struggle, and success comes through following instructions ("heed the silence") rather than confronting obstacles. No visible price is paid for the immense power gained.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes center on Maelia's need to repair her soul through the orchard's power, with one meaningful deepening as the ritual progresses from individual sigils to the hollow's "heartbeat." The cost appears in "bartered destinies" and the burned card's sacrifice, though the specific price remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we don't experience what she loses in the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of "finding purpose after loss" remains abstract throughout, never facing concrete tests that narrow options. The story lacks escalation - the protagonist moves through reflection and cataloguing without encountering resistance or having to sacrifice anything tangible for their new path.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, the story achieves one meaningful deepening when the seed germinates and reveals the "physics of transition." However, the resolution arrives without genuine struggle - the seed simply works as hoped. The "cascade of silver particles" represents the departed spirit but doesn't create new complications or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central tension between preserving stories versus allowing them to migrate escalates through the key-forging decision. The librarian's agency drives the resolution though external pressure remains gentle. Cost appears in his physical transformation (gears softening) and relinquishing control to visitors, meeting the single meaningful deepening requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolated grief into communal hope—escalates through the accumulation of confessions and the pearl's increasing radiance. Each absorbed confession deepens the cost ("grief that lingered like rust") and narrows Mara's path toward her new role. However, the escalation lacks a moment of genuine resistance or trade-off; Mara proceeds without meaningful hesitation or competing options that would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of self-forgiveness deepens through accumulative pressure as the narrator moves from surface observation to tunnel discovery to riverside confession. The graffiti's wisdom that "Forgiveness is not a destination but a river you learn to cross" creates a meaningful reweighting, though agency remains somewhat passive until the final promise.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (finding the library of unspoken words) is signaled early and achieved, but without meaningful opposition or cost. No options are foreclosed; no price is paid. The quest proceeds through discovery after discovery without reversals or trade-offs that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on preserving light before oblivion, with escalation through the pattern-finding process to successful infusion. The aurora's acknowledgment and final reignition provide cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiveness—progresses through ritual action (hairpin alignment) to earned understanding. The storm sequence adds external pressure that tests Mara's "kindly decisive" nature. However, escalation feels predetermined rather than pressured, and the cost of endless tending could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes center on transforming rigid certainty into nuanced judgment, signaled early and maintained throughout, but escalation remains conceptual rather than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Mira's need to transform her reverse aging into a teachable gift, with the grotto visit as the test.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from discovering the arrowhead to achieving non-physical navigation, with the birds' arrival creating the decisive pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding sacred value in simple magic versus mechanized brilliance—is signaled early but lacks concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering sound's color—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation or opposition. The quest proceeds without genuine obstacles: key fits lock, door opens, library reveals answer. No tightening of options or rising cost appears; coincidence (finding the exact book) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on finding purpose before universal contraction completes. Escalation occurs through accumulative pattern—each coin pop building toward revelation, with the final coin creating the decisive frequency alignment. Cost is present but somewhat abstract ("doubts still lingered"). The tightening from scattered coins to single frequency provides meaningful deepening under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on transforming "nameless fears" through naming, with each crystal revealing a specific dread that Lira must confront. The pressure accumulates as she names Astraeon, Lyrith, Morvain, building toward her own lost love's name. However, the conflict lacks external resistance—the naming proceeds too smoothly without genuine obstacles or cost beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—expunging the sabotage myth—is established early but lacks escalating pressure.

The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (harmonizing logic and intuition) is signaled early and pursued through concrete ritual steps.

However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition or risk—the ritual proceeds smoothly without meaningful setbacks or forced trade-offs that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract - "the watcher's burden" and maintaining "trust" lack concrete opposition or cost. The storm provides backdrop rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict between Guardians and Syndicate dissolves too easily after the glass breaks—both sides immediately accept the new paradigm without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the seed will bloom when participants solve puzzles—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through intensifying sound layers (whisper→lullaby→vortex→symphony), with the hourglass providing temporal constraint. The transformation occurs too smoothly—silence yields to laughter without meaningful resistance or complication that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - the guardian's need for dimensional home/connection - escalates through the pendant discovery and the choice to risk the garden's order. The tension between preservation (waiting) and transformation (making friends with uncertainty) creates genuine pressure. However, the middle section lacks a concrete test of this conflict; the guardian's decision feels somewhat predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate through successive approximation with each penny drop marking progression—from no spark to "soft ember" to "cascade of ember-light" to final eruption. The destiny-as-cage metaphor provides coherent pressure, though the conflict lacks visceral immediacy; the alchemist never faces a moment where failure would exact a specific, dramatized price beyond continued hopelessness.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake of reviving the dead city coheres but lacks meaningful tightening or deepening under the accumulative lens. The resolution arrives through technical manipulation without genuine opposition or escalating pressure that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation occurs through pattern intensification: radio broadcast → phosphorescent threads → materializing passengers → permanent resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation occurs through density increase - each weaving creates larger transformations from color cascades to golden rain to the final bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (preserving forgotten knowledge) is signaled early but escalation relies on convenient technology rather than protagonist agency. The phase transition provides spectacle without meaningful cost or trade-off, and the resolution (burying the codex) contradicts the stated goal without earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (recovering true identity from digital corruption) escalates through the ink ritual's progression, but agency feels limited—Mara follows a predetermined algorithm rather than making costly choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving a dying language through texture-to-sound translation—is clear from the opening.

The transformation proceeds too smoothly; the "cursed" diamond's danger never manifests as actual threat or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes emerge through accumulation as the garden responds to the arrowhead and phone, building toward transformation. The protagonist's agency manifests in placing the arrowhead strategically, though the escalation relies heavily on environmental response rather than character-driven pressure. Cost becomes legible in "the weight of years of dead ends."

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of reawakening beauty against mechanical oppression is signaled early and tightens when the bronze statue demands cessation. The escalation through heart rhythms to ground trembling to full transformation follows the accumulative lens adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—bridging rival factions—escalates through the drone encounter where Milo must risk using the storm. The pressure tightens when the drone's sensors threaten detection, forcing Milo's decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through deepening discoveries (hidden compartment, spiral staircase, mirror cavern) but lacks genuine resistance or cost.

Stakes remain abstract (preserving memories) without concrete consequences for failure or success that would matter to Mara personally.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - "capturing a runaway dream" and "cipher of longing" never translate to concrete pressure that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine escalation occurs under the accumulative lens—the locksmith faces no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and encounters only convenient revelation ("The answer arrived as a sigh of wind").

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) is signaled early and progresses through discovery beats—finding the sextant, experiencing the flash of images, arranging mushroom caps.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on ending the library's "reversible exile" with escalation through tea-leaf decoding revealing "a precise moment when the sun would strike," then the shadow fracturing into "thousand luminous shards," culminating in the altar scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes center on preserving wonder through the seed's transformation, with the storm providing the only meaningful complication that the pruner overcomes through song.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—releasing restless spirits through untangling grief—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes emerge through accumulation: the "whispered chapel hidden beneath" needs reopening, building through video comparison to glyph discovery.

Cost remains primarily conceptual—"centuries of loss"—rather than viscerally felt, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding letting go—deepens through the untangling action and listening to the transmission. The tightening occurs when "the final strand snapped" and the console reveals its message.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on the ghost's need for embodied connection versus digital existence, with pressure building through three lightning moments that deepen communication. The balladeer's agency drives each encoding choice, from midnight blossom to sunrise tulip.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—retrieving joy from beneath anguish—progresses through discovery (goggles), revelation (diary), and retrieval (crystal jars) without meaningful resistance or cost. The servant faces no opposition or difficult choice; the quest unfolds as predetermined steps rather than earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—proving "empty spaces remember"—remains abstract throughout without concrete opposition or test. No meaningful tightening occurs; Aria simply completes her categorization without obstacle or cost. The comet appears as coincidence rather than earned revelation, and her departure lacks the weight of foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=3.8)
    The noon demolition creates time pressure but never tests Lira's commitment or forces trade-offs. She completes her mural without obstacle, adaptation, or meaningful choice under pressure. The "hush before the wreckage" maintains static tension rather than escalating toward a crisis that would demand agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping the stranded luminance to guide future voyages—progresses through accumulation of decoded patterns rather than escalating pressure. While the luminance intensifies and spreads through the ship's copper veins at closure, no meaningful trade-off or foreclosed option creates genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: from searching to discovering prophecy fragments to finding the hall of mirrors to assembling the gear mechanism. The stakes deepen when "each surface melting into the rhythm of a heartbeat" reveals the scope of temporal repair needed. Cost is visible but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—awakening hope through collective action—is signaled early but lacks concrete opposition or cost. The bell-ringing succeeds without complication or trade-off. While the nebula brightens and arches pulse in response, no option forecloses and no price is paid beyond gathering effort.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - pausing time's relentless ticking to deliver a lullaby across lifetimes - is signaled early and deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. Pressure builds through the textural intensification of sound patterns, light effects, and the puppet head's transformation. The cost is legible in both the "borrowed pause" and Elara's departure carrying "bruised awe," though the conflict lacks sharp opposition or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear dominant stake of completing the ritual before frost with escalation through approaching the altar and placing the nut. The frost deadline creates genuine temporal pressure that narrows options. However, no meaningful opposition or complication challenges the progression - the protagonist simply walks to the stump and places the nut without obstacles or trade-offs beyond the already-established curse cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clear escalation from observing foam → recognizing pattern → building prototype → achieving solution. The stakes (redeeming failed research) remain consistent but don't significantly tighten. The cost (leaving lab for wild) is established but could be more visceral. Agency drives the resolution through Mara's active experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories begin—progresses through accumulation (counting voids, moonlight brightening, scripts unfurling) but lacks meaningful resistance or complication. The vendor achieves his goal without obstacle or trade-off. The child's arrival adds texture but doesn't test commitment or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—healing collective trauma stored in the fortress—escalates from analysis to active transformation as Lir moves from observing tidal pools to directly engaging the pavilion's stored remorse. The contagious spread of sorrow through touch creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution lacks a moment where Lir must sacrifice something personal or face genuine risk; the transformation proceeds too smoothly once initiated.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—healing the city's isolation through connecting silos—escalates from the librarian's solitary action to communal participation, with workers emerging to build bridges. The cost appears in their recognition of "families they had left behind and futures they had yet to imagine," though the transformation lacks sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake - becoming "archeologist of abandoned dreams" - is declared but never tested against meaningful opposition. The canyon's tremor provides token resistance that Aria overcomes through simple determination. No genuine risk materializes; the mirror works exactly as theorized without forcing trade-offs or revealing unexpected costs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the inverted gravity hour provides temporal pressure and the grotto journey creates spatial progression, no genuine opposition or meaningful choice-point challenges Liora's quest. The discovery unfolds without resistance or trade-off; she gains the forgotten combinations without losing anything tangible, undermining the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—creating music in silence—remains consistent but escalation is limited to accumulation rather than meaningful opposition. The story deepens through discovery (stress cracks as score) but lacks a tightening that forecloses options. The hedgehog's dance and owls' emergence provide textural payoff without raising cost or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the story maintains consistent atmospheric pressure through accumulating imagery, there's no meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options—the tutor simply continues walking and thinking. The "eclipsed covenant" stake never faces concrete testing, and his discovery lacks opposition or cost that would create genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of unlocking empathy through cataloging silence progresses through tuning frequencies and opening the diary, but escalation remains gentle without meaningful resistance or cost. The protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs; success comes through patient attunement rather than struggle, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.6)
    Minimal conflict - Lira plants a seed and waits while it grows exactly as intended. The elders' warning about patience creates no actual obstacle. No meaningful tightening occurs; the flower blooms on schedule without complication, reversal, or cost to Lira's other goals.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake - finding the source of resilience - progresses steadily but lacks meaningful tightening or reversal. The discovery happens smoothly without complication or trade-off. While the gravity inversion creates temporal pressure, Mira faces no real obstacles or choices that narrow her options during the search itself.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—dissipating lingering storm energy—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or complication. Mara's survey proceeds without setback, her hypothesis proves correct, and the resolution arrives through whispered command without trade-off. The "singular convergence" folding onto itself lacks earned causality from protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    No conflict exists beyond the abstract goal to "certify wonder as essential," which faces no opposition or complication. The piece lacks any reversal, tightening, or deepening that would create escalation—the bell ringer simply performs her intended action without obstacle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake of harvesting insights from failure is signaled early but escalation is minimal. The flute opening the seam represents the story's single meaningful action, but no resistance or complication tests Mara's commitment. The journey through worlds passes without obstacle or cost, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density—from single printed line to borrowed personalities seeping into the fragment to the final cascade of light. The dominant stake (understanding emotion's mathematics) deepens through each press cycle. Cost becomes visible when the fragment cracks, releasing what Mara has encoded, though earlier pressure points could strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake of spreading wonder escalates through three encounters (shepherd, girl, implied merchants), each deepening the pendant's power from individual transformation to generational legend. The courier's agency drives each interaction, though pressure could tighten more dramatically. Cost appears in the "fade from memory to legend" and the pendant's dimming glow after each use.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—faces minimal opposition or escalation. The prism yields its secret without meaningful resistance, and Liora faces no trade-off or sacrifice. The "shifted hush" deepens but doesn't tighten pressure, and the discovery arrives without forcing her to forfeit anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - sending a message across "impossible distance" - is clear, with escalation through the puzzle-path discovery and the growing resonance as "each click a quiet chord rang through the raveling silence." However, the progression lacks genuine obstacles or reversals; Mara faces no meaningful resistance, and the sacrifice feels predetermined rather than forced by mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of rebuilding/resilience progresses through silk acquisition to blade forging, but escalation remains steady rather than tightening. The memory barter provides one meaningful cost, yet the subsequent forging lacks resistance or complication. The villagers' gathering adds minimal pressure since the blade's success feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from discovering truth to freeing the frozen crew, with the shard's destruction as visible cost. The "cyclically spontaneous pulse" creates ambient pressure, though the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that would force harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.8)
    No clear escalation occurs under any lens. The dominant stake—preserving safety through the ritual—never faces opposition or complication. Marek performs his actions without obstacle, cost, or meaningful choice. The story lacks pressure points where options narrow or deepen; everything proceeds as intended without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—completing the ritual before "the tide erases our chance"—provides urgency but the escalation relies on accumulating imagery rather than narrowing options. The newspaper's dissolution triggers the ritual but coincidence ("Accidentally prophetic" signs) drives discovery more than protagonist agency, and the cost remains abstract ("shadowed brilliance") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes center on understanding story magnetism, but escalation remains gentle—Lira follows paths and makes discoveries without meaningful opposition or narrowing options. The final loom activation carries some weight but lacks the pressure of foreclosed alternatives or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - transforming the labyrinth's quantified sorrow - is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the grid's deconstruction and dream-mapping process. However, there's no meaningful opposition or complication; Eli proceeds without obstacles, and the transformation happens too smoothly without genuine tension or trade-offs that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (rekindling the dying realm) is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or cost. The story progresses through accumulation rather than conflict—light spreads, visitors arrive, seeds sprout—without any tightening that forecloses options. Lira's "bound release" moment lacks earned pressure; she simply raises her arms and succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of confronting past mistakes is declared but never tested through concrete pressure—the recluse faces no resistance, makes no difficult choices, and pays no price for his revelation. The library visit proceeds without obstacle or escalation; even the curator immediately grants access to the deepest chamber without any trial or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of finding meaning in ruins signals early but never faces pressure or complication—the protagonist discovers bread, carries it to tea house, shares it symbolically without obstacle or trade-off. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens; density increases but doesn't narrow options or force choice. The "tenuous absolution" arrives without earning through conflict or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (retrieving/understanding the slide to find meaning) established early with one meaningful deepening as measurements reveal the slide's luminous vows. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks concrete obstacles—the chief proceeds without meaningful opposition or cost beyond patience. The "edge of oblivion" remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - protecting the market's lanterns to maintain the truce - is signaled early and tightens when Captain Marrow's scout appears. Lila's agency drives the escalation through concrete actions: planting the decoy, seizing the rope, hurling the lanterns into darkness. The cost is visible in the "seed of future conflict" and the temporary nature of victory, though the physical confrontation resolves somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the story builds texture through sensory details but lacks meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization. The "convergence" happens around Arin rather than through his agency—he observes and records but makes no costly choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on uncorking "suppressed creativity," with pressure building through the symbolic lock puzzle and Lena's "inescapable calling." The resolution through luminous ink and the portrait's transformation delivers meaningful deepening, though the mystical resolution reduces some tension since no clear failure state threatens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (restoring truth to heal the world) is signaled early and deepens through accumulation: council demand → map discovery → bottle cataloguing → vent activation. Each step narrows options and builds pressure, though the resolution feels somewhat mechanistic (speaking truth immediately heals sky). The calligrapher's agency drives all major turns, with visible cost in defying authority, though the final transformation could use more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs—the piece maintains a single emotional register throughout. The "season of silence" is presented as already resolved through the kinetic sculpture solution. Stakes remain abstract (preserving "wonder") without concrete opposition or cost that would force a choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (resolving inner static through external chaos management) escalates through magnetic disruption → miniaturization → controlled burn, with the fire's "measured arcs" showing agency. However, the miniaturization solution arrives without struggle or trade-off, and the "controlled burn escape" threat dissipates too easily without forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—proving listening heals—is signaled but never seriously tested. The story presents discoveries without resistance or meaningful tightening; each revelation flows too easily without forcing trade-offs or narrowing Mara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake of encrypting vulnerability as strength signals early and tightens when the rising tide seals the door, forcing Selene to transform the lock "into a melody." The revelation of the memory crystal provides a deepening that reweights her mission from personal to communal. However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or cost—the dice yield immediately to her song, and the lab's final "collapse" reads as willing release rather than earned struggle against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early and progresses through Mara's coffee ground divination to entering the chamber. However, escalation lacks genuine resistance; the chamber opens readily, memories appear without struggle, and gravity pockets shift but never truly threaten. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each ritual stage tightens toward completion—from placing the wing, to breathing the hush outward, to the final sealing. The cost manifests in the wing's transformation and the world's permanent alteration ("the code would remain unread"), though agency could be tested more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—learning to commune with buildings through "agreed upon lies"—remains consistent but lacks meaningful tightening beyond the sugar-borrowing solution that establishes weekly meetings. The story presents accumulation rather than escalation: meteor shower intensifies, understanding deepens, but no genuine reversal or narrowing of options occurs. The cost remains primarily conceptual (accepting deception as path to truth) without visceral pressure that would elevate the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake of transforming isolation into independence is signaled early but lacks concrete pressure points. The story presents a single continuous transformation without reversals or tightening choices that would force trade-offs under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Liora traces verses, discovers hidden script, completes her work without opposition or tightening pressure. The "calibrated treason" never tests her commitment or forces trade-offs. Stakes remain abstract (honoring the unfinished) without concrete cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on the singer's quest for understanding, with pressure building through progressive disclosure of echoes (child's laughter, lover's farewell) toward the cavern revelation. The tension remains primarily philosophical rather than urgent. While the shell joining creates a meaningful deepening, the lack of opposition or real risk of failure keeps escalation gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual quest to collective healing as the whisperer realizes she must guide dream fragments back through others. The shift from analyzing to embedding cameos shows agency. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost - we see method but not price of this spiritual labor.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens. The philosopher performs the same contemplative actions (observing fireflies, tracing patterns, whistling) without deepening pressure or narrowing options. The second evening merely repeats the first with slight variations—fireflies "spelling out a pattern of gratitude"—but this generates no cost or trade-off that would constitute genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (uncovering truth about the diamond) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation—Mira encounters no real obstacles, reversals, or costs in her investigation. The dust storms intensify but don't create pressure that forces difficult choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of forging variant allegiances through ancient shadows progresses from vision to implementation, with the copper coils and drone choir representing tactical evolution. However, escalation relies more on accumulation of imagery than genuine pressure that narrows options. The cost remains conceptual rather than felt, and the "scattered clans" rallying happens off-page without dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each captured sound enriches the collection ("tinny waltz" to "child's laughter" to "migrating gull"). The dominant stake—preserving generational memory—tightens when the poet steps onto the sand with jar in hand, foreclosing his solitary existence. The cost manifests when he shares his collected treasures with the child, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (protecting the Heart from weaponization) is stated but never tested through active opposition. The technical challenge of frequency matching provides some pressure, but without antagonistic force or time constraint, escalation remains limited to procedural steps rather than meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict emerges—Elara observes, records, and achieves her goal without opposition or meaningful choice. The "patient revolution" never tests her commitment through concrete obstacles. The story lacks escalation; each paragraph restates the same thematic content without deepening pressure or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of preventing future deaths through infrastructure mapping is declared but never faces genuine test or complication—Mara simply follows clues to find and turn a valve without meaningful resistance. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens; density increases through historical layering but pressure doesn't tighten to force trade-offs. The resolution comes too easily without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether mechanical repair can enable spiritual redemption—is signaled early and maintained. The tension builds adequately through the repair sequence, with the fresh spring providing a meaningful deepening. However, the resolution arrives too easily without significant resistance or complication, and the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—ringing the unhearable bell—is achieved without meaningful resistance or cost; the "ultimate prank on fate" lacks weight when fate never pushes back. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—density remains constant rather than intensifying toward closure. The algorithm's yearning provides motivation but no opposition or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity through discovery to moral choice about perpetuating lies. The dominant stake (finding the lost crew) tightens when Lia realizes the numbers are a deliberate message, forcing her decision to spread fabricated content with clear trade-off between truth and rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("unspoken hopes pressing against the ice") without concrete pressure forcing difficult choices. The crystal reconstruction proceeds without opposition or meaningful complication—the mirrors simply work as intended, showing visions that guide rather than challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal - from seeking death to finding meaning in disaster relief to understanding endings differently. The "fold in patience" evolves from mysterious sensation to understood metaphor. Cost remains somewhat abstract despite the emotional weight; the narrator's transformation lacks a concrete price beyond philosophical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - the sentinel plants the letter fragment, the vines respond metaphorically, and he feels understood. The dominant stake (achieving "intersubjective understanding") remains abstract without concrete pressure that would force trade-offs. The piece maintains a single emotional register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the piece maintains consistent atmospheric pressure through its accumulative design, it lacks meaningful tightening or deepening that would narrow options or force trade-offs.

The "echo of wisdom" stake never faces concrete testing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of collective healing is signaled early but lacks concrete opposition or tightening pressure. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs—the photographs simply accumulate without forcing trade-offs. The resolution arrives without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (decoding language patterns) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The crystal simply reveals its secrets when observed correctly. No meaningful tightening occurs - discovery proceeds smoothly without cost, trade-offs, or foreclosed options that would create escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure accumulates through the prophet's navigation deeper into the garden, with each driftwood marker "pointing toward a different memory" creating textural density. The stakes—capturing aging's sound before it slips away—remain consistent but could benefit from more tangible opposition or cost beyond the metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict—taming the eternally spinning clock hand—resolves through technical adjustment rather than meaningful escalation or cost. No real obstacles complicate the repair; the sage simply attunes to the leaf's rhythm and completes his work without struggle, resistance, or trade-offs that would create tension.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Mara performs her ritual exactly as planned without resistance, complication, or tightening pressure. Mr. Harlan's death is predetermined by blood work, removing agency from the central event. The story lacks a turn where options narrow or costs become visible; everything unfolds as intended from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes center on Lira's desire to solve the shadow riddle, but pressure never meaningfully tightens—she methodically works without opposition or time constraint. The "sealed awakenings" present no resistance, and success arrives without trade-off or visible price beyond time spent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract—restoring "the missing vertebrae of truth" and healing a "substitute body" whose emptiness matters only conceptually. No concrete pressure builds toward the healing moment; the tooth works without resistance, removing tension from what should be the climactic act.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain abstract - "to share light without using fire" - without concrete opposition or cost. The piece maintains coherent pressure through accumulation but never tests the protagonist's commitment through meaningful resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of transforming grief into healing knowledge is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation—Lira encounters no resistance, setbacks, or complications as she moves through the space. The discovery of the dormant interface provides a deepening moment but arrives without struggle, and the transformation completes without visible price or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation—each hope gathered adds weight ("she felt the weight of each hope settle into the paper"), the narrative current intensifies its pull, and the mist thickens until "the book itself inhaled." The dominant stake of collecting/binding hopes against conventional narrative deepens through pattern, though a sharper tightening moment would strengthen this.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the ritual's progression: from initial contact with the vine to playing the lyre to the moon's arrival releasing "glowing pollen." The dominant stake (restoring sacred practices) tightens as Mara realizes "the remedy was not a potion but a reenactment of memory." Cost appears in her permanent vow to guard these practices.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of creating luminous maps appears early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The ritual succeeds without obstacle, and "patience physically demonstrated" becomes repetitive assertion rather than tested commitment. No meaningful tightening occurs; the story maintains steady state from ritual preparation through completion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing wonder from echoes—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The timer repair proceeds without setback, the echo-harvest succeeds immediately, and no trade-off or foreclosed option appears. The story lacks escalation under its Accumulative lens; density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—releasing the grotto's trapped sorrow—is clear, but escalation is minimal as the weaver methodically completes her task without meaningful resistance or complication. The process requires patience and proper alignment, but these constraints don't create genuine pressure or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into something useful—is clear, with escalation through the carving process as sap emerges and crystallizes. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases toward closure. However, the conflict lacks external resistance; everything proceeds too smoothly without meaningful obstacles or reversals that would force harder choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Mara's need to reconcile with her abandoned path through ghost negotiation, with the camera wheel serving as mechanical conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting hope through engineering—progresses from power restoration to communication beacon activation, showing escalation. However, no meaningful obstacles resist her efforts; the terminal simply responds to her redirected flows without complication or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the abandoned dream—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication.

The "excruciatingly gentle" process lacks the escalation or deepening that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.9)
    The lock mechanism provides one concrete obstacle resolved through sundial alignment, but escalation remains flat—no opposing force complicates the seeker's progress. The "architecture of lies unraveling" declares stakes without dramatizing resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on preserving ancient knowledge before it vanishes, with pressure building through the rope's revelations and culminating in the master weaver's signal. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than meaningful tightening—no clear cost or trade-off emerges from his patient vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping healing through recording absences—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening. The rose's revival represents a deepening moment, yet no genuine opposition tests the traveler's commitment. The "gentle tide of understanding" arrives without sufficient resistance, and while the ending suggests ongoing work ("each corridor required a new thread"), the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain largely abstract—"reawaken beauty in a mechanical world"—without concrete opposition or cost. The egg's discovery and successful hatching proceed without meaningful resistance, and the world's transformation happens too easily through song alone.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving "scars can sing"—is established early and tested through the ritual's execution. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as the coin's resonance spreads from sand to pier to clouds to villagers. However, there's minimal active opposition; the conflict is largely internal and retrospective, lacking the immediate pressure that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—progresses through accumulative pressure as Mara follows symbols, reaches the alcove, and applies "sidereal patience" to open the box. The tightening occurs when "the box shivered, its hinges tightening as if bound by an ancient reluctance." However, the resolution lacks significant opposition or trade-off beyond patience, limiting the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—remains consistent but static. Escalation occurs through accumulation (sonar echoes widening, calculations spinning faster) rather than active conflict. The revelation of "forgotten wars" provides texture but doesn't alter tactics or force new choices. Agency exists in the final planting but lacks the pressure of competing options.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure accumulates through the three-month butterfly migration timeline and Mara's spectral guidance pushing Eliam toward understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—averting famine through predictive modeling—is clear, but escalation remains steady rather than tightening. The three-month delay and silverfish surge complicate without forcing trade-offs; the aurora discovery feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Mara's copying) to communal (city's theatrical revival) through the pirate broadcast's arrival.

The conflict remains relatively gentle, with cost implied rather than dramatized through direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pressure accumulates through textural layering but lacks a decisive tightening moment—the protagonist performs her ritual without meaningful opposition or cost. The "fleeting emotion" crystallizes but we never see what capturing it costs her or what alternative she foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient water management methods—faces pressure through competing historical narratives that must be reconciled. Escalation occurs through the cog's synchronization with sediment layers, forcing a choice between championing one story or preserving both. The cost manifests in accepting ambiguity rather than clarity, though the conflict could benefit from more visceral opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.9)

The "across unlearning hatred" timeframe is stated but doesn't create pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    The celestial alignment provides temporal pressure and the pruning represents meaningful choice with cost ("each cut a note in a symphony of hope").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder to routine after the hive failure—escalates through Mara's discovery sequence with the matchbox riddle forcing action. The echo revelation deepens rather than reverses, reframing loss as necessary pause. Cost is visible in the "wound on the city's heart" and Mara's compelled truthfulness, though pressure could tighten more sharply between riddle and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens as the hush spreads through the town. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as silence radiates outward, but lacks meaningful tightening or pressure that would force difficult choices. The resolution arrives through observation and gentle acceptance rather than through agency that forecloses options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.9)
    While the story maintains its mystical atmosphere, escalation is minimal—Liora prepares the paste, applies it, and achieves her goal without meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to transform grief—is clear, with Nara's joy-induced weightlessness providing a unique constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the story establishes Mara's search for understanding as its dominant stake, escalation occurs through passive accumulation (fireflies escape, fisherman appears, prophecy revealed) rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful options are foreclosed, and the "coincidences" that resolve tension undercut earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (sparking revolution) is declared but never tested against opposition. No meaningful tightening occurs—Kael executes his plan without setback, discovery, or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening the seed before monsoon—creates genuine time pressure that shapes Mara's choices.

The cost is legible in the untethering of the rope and the weight lifting. The stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, though the middle could show more active tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift from melancholic reflection to active, hopeful resolve. The dominant stake (internal peace vs. regret) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens. The cost of choosing hope over sorrow is legible on the page ("his sorrow dissolve into the light"). Agency is demonstrated through the decision to paddle forward, foreclosing the path of despair.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening that reweights the dominant stake (redemption) from erasure to rewriting. The protagonist's agency is clear in key choices: choosing the left tunnel, peering into the mirror, and tossing the baseball. The cost is felt in the realization that the clean slate is "not blank but rewritten," a trade-off that narrows future options toward empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift driven by her agency in mixing the spices and whispering his name. The cost is unmistakable in the "tremor of change" and the final bark patterns, reweighting the stake of mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift (the saucer's sigh, the vapor's rise) that reweights the dominant stake of retrieving lost time. The protagonist's agency in following the staircase and unfastening her heart drives the escalation, and the cost of her released grief is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification of emotional and conceptual pressure. The dominant stake of opening the dimension is tightened by Nara's need to generate genuine happiness to achieve weightlessness, a cost paid through the "cold pressure" of universal sorrow. The final choice is an act of agency that forecloses her old life.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the jar's trembling and the fisherman's arrival serving as meaningful deepenings that reweight the stake. The cost of releasing the fireflies is conceptually legible, though its felt price is somewhat abstract. The dominant stake of understanding transformation is signaled early and tightens coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the Causal lens, his actions tightening the plot toward the climax. The dominant stake of fomenting revolution is clear. The cost—the irreversible, quiet shift in the garrison's consciousness—is felt. The escalation is slightly linear, lacking a significant mid-point complication or reversal that tests his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase as the star dust ignites and the tide pauses. The dominant stake (harnessing the dust to understand patterns) is tested by her fear of the curse, and her agency in placing the final stone forces a trade-off that forecloses other paths. The cost is legible in the "weight of the lingering promise" settling on her shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the Accumulative lens—setting the timer, whispering the poem—which deepens the stake of mapping scars. The cost is legible as the storm holds its breath, awaiting his revelation, and the final reconfiguration carries a profound conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulative intensification of the hidden overture and the coded angles of the sundial, narrowing the philosophical conflict toward a single, decisive move. The cost is the foreclosing of pure victory for a shared destination, felt in the diplomat's bow.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a clear density increase: from receiving the tin, to reading the manifesto, to planting seeds, to attracting vagrants. Each act deepens the stake of rebuilding a new world, with the final image of travelers arriving serving as a decisive cadence shift that confirms the rebellion's success.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure increasing through density and a cadence shift. The dominant stake (the encore) is signaled early. Cost is legible but becomes unmistakable only at the very end, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the hybrid lens: her dream interpretation actively tightens the stakes, narrowing options toward the monsoon's arrival. The cost is unmistakable—the fragile shoot risks being drowned by the "monsoon’s first heavy breath." A single meaningful deepening (the dream translation sequence) suffices for this length, foreclosing other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the tutor's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear, meaningful tightening as each knot and recitation shifts the compass. The cost of the effort and the release of sorrow are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are quiet (prove/embody a hypothesis; find calm through precision), and escalation is accumulative via humidity shifts, cracks widening, and a greenhouse reclassification from tomb to sanctuary. Agency is attention and disciplined restraint; she chooses method over spectacle. The price—foregoing dramatic proofs for slow data—is present but subtle. Pressure never sharply tightens, yet it coherently deepens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—reclaiming craft and purpose—with one meaningful tightening (dawn melts frost, revealing the groove) and a discovery turn (mine, luminous shards). Escalation is gentle and primarily textural rather than adversarial; the cost is implied more than dramatized. Agency drives the search and the kiln’s reassembly. The ending’s stance crystallizes without a sharp trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music for healing—tightens when she activates the device and commits to the final chord. Escalation is gentle and accumulative; pressure grows via tone and image rather than hard reversals. The price (opening scars, becoming a beacon for others) is implied and credible. Lack of a concrete obstacle or forced trade‑off keeps tension from cresting higher.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—granting the dead rest—tightens as each pulse elicits response, culminating in the last shard placed in an impossible location. The escalation is a clear density increase rather than adversarial conflict, appropriate to the chosen lens. Cost is present in the closing surrender of self, though intermediate trade-offs are lightly sketched. Pressure coheres from task to sanctuary without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—feeding the community without detection—is clear; pressure coheres via secrecy and risk. Escalation is gentle: a month’s success, then a renewed commitment; no concrete complication forces a trade‑off on the page. Agency exists (Mara’s bell and organization), but the price paid remains conceptual rather than dramatized as a narrowed option or loss. The ending steadies rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (locate and free unused love) is announced early and tightened via breath‑slowed mapping, tunnel access, and lattice ignition. Escalation is gentle and largely uncontested; the single meaningful deepening is the breath‑mediated sharpening to the reservoir. The resolution comes from Milo’s agency, but the cost remains understated. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—realizing a maze that dissolves static perception—and escalation is a density increase: mist, photographs, refracting light, the child’s pause, then completion at dusk. The child-triggered new arch provides the main pressure uptick, but the price and foreclosed alternatives remain light. Agency is partially externalized to the garden; Mara’s decisions drive design but not a decisive, costly turn. Tension stays lyrical rather than tightening around a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are high in premise (last grains, famine), but on‑page resistance is low; the bench decodes without setback, and guardians never appear. The meaningful tightening is the recognition of the carnival‑schedule melody, yet it sidesteps hard trade‑offs. The wall’s collapse adds scale but not pressure on Mara’s choices. The result is satisfying but under‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—tightens via accumulation: selecting the coral’s “perfect absence,” recording the lullaby, and returning nightly until a full chord forms. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial; the price is largely emotional burden, not a foreclosed option. Still, the cadence shift at the end (device hums a complete tapestry) reads as a meaningful deepen. A sharper on‑page trade‑off would have intensified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (securing and repurposing the moonbeams) is clear, but opposition is minimal and assistance is convenient (the conductor supplies codes). Escalation is a smooth procession of unlocks without a real setback or trade‑off. The tightening occurs via discovery (the map) rather than pressure. Cost remains conceptual, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stakes (creating safe inquiry zones) are clear; escalation occurs via the renunciation of speed and the choice to pursue careful, ritualized labor. Pressure remains mostly internal and textural; no hard external turn forces a trade‑off beyond time and control. The final stance is earned, though the on‑page price felt is modest. Tension hums rather than tightens decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—earn honest courage—tightens through decoding, the lever’s collapse risk, and the vial’s demand for a self-betrayal. Escalation results from Mara’s agency at each turn rather than coincidence. The visible price is more conceptual than material; the external hazard resolves without injury, keeping the cost somewhat soft. Nonetheless the choice forecloses the mask and redirects future action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation manifests as a cadence tightening: storm intensifies, sky dims to one star, the booklet’s final question forces a response. Agency is endurance/attention: he binds the map with his breath, accepting dissolution—a credible tradeoff. Stakes remain focused (can an endless night be charted?), and the price reweights the ending. The pressure is coherent but largely internal and textural rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (locating thought’s source) is clear, with a meaningful tightening via the melting instrument and the choice to sacrifice a memory fragment. Pressure escalates gently but coherently; no antagonist, yet a visible price is paid (violin’s loss, fragment projected). The resolution arises from the protagonist’s agency and returns to duty with reconfigured stakes. The low friction and composure slightly mute tension.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear (thawing mistrust), but pressure is gentle; obstacles scarcely resist. The meaningful tightening is the move from private decoding to public projection, yet it involves little trade‑off beyond implied exposure. Escalation is more tonal density than conflict. Earned, but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—proving reciprocal recognition—tightens as the garden escalates its responses to his ritual. The meaningful “turn” is the oak’s voiced acknowledgment and the crown of vines, but there’s minimal resistance or tradeoff along the way. Cost is more conceptual than practical. The arc remains coherent and grows, yet risk or loss is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are coherent (prove the hypothesis), and the tightening occurs when she pulls the etched lever and the nexus intensifies. Yet pressure remains gentle; there’s no credible risk or trade-off beyond ambience, so escalation feels low. The experiment’s success faces no on-page obstacle, which mutes tension. The birds’ hush is a nice clock, but it doesn’t force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the ghost’s code—tightens when watery lines align with marginalia and demand a single sustained note, a decisive deepening. The escalation is quiet but coherent: observation → test note → image shift → final chord. The price remains soft (risking the fragile instrument and disturbing the hush), so tension doesn’t crest at a sharply felt loss. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is clear—quantify the internal lie—and the meaningful tightening arrives when she adjusts the barometer “by a fraction” and waits through trembling to a decisive number. Tension grows through density and cadence rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. Still, the price and foreclosure read gentle: no option is truly lost beyond an interior stance, and the risk feels low. The result is satisfying but not pressurized to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to extract or leave a truth‑weighted relic—tightens through pattern recognition to a single figure, then resolves in a renunciation. Escalation is primarily tonal and cognitive; the pressure coheres, but danger remains mostly atmospheric. The refusal forecloses a path with conceptual cost, aligning with the chosen lens. One added external stressor or irreversible consequence would sharpen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes cohere around whether he will seek transformation or hold to witnessing; pressure tightens as the silence grows “louder” and the fissures narrow. His agency drives the deepening: choosing to burrow, to enter, and to record only a single line. The price—thought dissolution and a fragile, “crumbling peace”—reads, though the threat never becomes perilous beyond the lyric register. One meaningful tightening is achieved at the refuge threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are legible (can she create a communal link in a singular moment?), but escalation is minimal: there’s no credible risk of failure or trade‑off beyond timing the music. The “softly adaptive” choice deepens the beat but doesn’t foreclose options or exact a price. The result is a graceful swell rather than tightening pressure. Resolution feels preordained once the eclipse starts.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the axis memory—tightens through a clear investigative sequence. The escalation is soft but real: the hum becomes vibration, then architectural response and chamber shiver. The price remains largely atmospheric (isolation, dust, age), not a hard trade-off. Still, the activation reweights the situation meaningfully at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are mostly conceptual (truth dissemination, legacy of encoded lives), with little real-time resistance. The “tightening” is the first visitor cracking the cookie and the cache reveal—an intensification rather than a pressured turn. There’s no visible price or foreclosed option on the page. Tension is gentle and consistent but rarely sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early (anchor may shatter or seal; possession clock), and pressure coheres through deepening loops and the cathedral’s “inhale.” The final act (directing the echo like a spear) reads as agency‑driven escalation. The cost signal (risk of soul consumption) never quite exacts a price, softening the felt stakes. Still, urgency from the ticking and narrowing options carries.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (will she summon/conduct the unheard symphony) is clear and tightens as she moves from preparation to command. The meaningful turn is her spoken “Conduct,” which triggers the horizon’s fracture and the lake’s song. Pressure is largely lyric rather than oppositional; there’s little foreclosed option or price beyond effort and reorientation. Still, the cadence deepens and options reweight under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early and pressure coheres as the algorithm produces successively more charged corridors, culminating in the “final corridor.” Escalation is primarily cadence and density rather than tightened options with concrete prices. The acceptance choice resolves the conflict, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized. No antagonist is needed, but a sharper trade-off would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular (defeat numbness) and pressure coheres as the mirrored hush becomes a counterforce Marin must face, culminating when she switches from backward to forward play. Escalation is a density/cadence shift rather than a hard reversal, appropriate to the lens. The on‑page price—inducing pressure that “stretches” the filament—lands, though it’s more inward than risky. A slightly sharper tactical trade‑off would raise urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Primary stake—getting truth past the quarantine—tightens once when ordinary routes are foreclosed and the lateral shaft becomes the only viable tactic. The “followed home” seed doesn’t escalate on the page, slightly blunting pressure. The price is mostly conceptual (solitary integrity over overt defiance), nuanced but soft. Still, agency drives the turn and resolves the local problem credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the link between scent and tears—is signaled and deepened by the UV reveal and the collage of memories. Escalation is primarily internal, cresting in his decision to map scent‑induced sorrow; the price is a chosen intimacy with grief. There’s one meaningful tightening as the vial’s vapor triggers a cascade that compels a new stance. External pressure is low, keeping this just shy of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent (how to handle the rope’s memory and his own story), and pressure intensifies through multiplying forks culminating in the final fork. The ethical calculus is clear: preservation vs. surrender with a felt conceptual loss. Escalation is primarily by pattern‑density and option‑narrowing rather than concrete antagonism, but it tightens credibly. The resolution stems from the protagonist’s agency with a visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is gentle; escalation reads as a rising weave of sound and story rather than a narrowing of options. The key tightening is the bowl vibrating and vines responding, but no strong trade‑off or visible price is exacted. Stakes remain largely thematic (unbinding hush) instead of embodied risk. The final refrain is lovely yet low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing a saleable feeling—remains coherent, but pressure is low and mostly atmospheric. The escalation is a smooth intensification rather than a turn that forecloses options or exacts visible price. No real risk tests her thoroughness or ethics in‑scene. The courier arrives as setup for later stakes, not a complication that forces immediate recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain gentle and largely unopposed; the misdelivery facilitates rather than pressures. The primary tightening is discovery of the mother’s death and the choice to ritualize return, but no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Coincidence initiates and also smooths the path; little adaptation is required under stress. Earned warmth arrives, yet the narrative avoids any difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on forging communal belonging, but pressure remains low and largely unopposed. The principal tightening is the trek to the glyph and Arlen’s vow, which converts intention into a public commitment. There’s little felt price or foreclosed option on the page beyond the implied ongoing duty. The escalation is beautiful but gentle, more ceremonial than testing.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via density: pendant glow → bridge → descent → vortex → renunciation. The cost is concrete (losing the pendant), but opposition is largely atmospheric; tension is more wonder than threat. The single decisive tightening works at this length under the accumulative lens. Slight abstraction of risk keeps it below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure rises via density and cadence rather than opposition: alignment → vibration → numeric revelation → bridge insight → incantation. Stakes remain internal and gentle; no genuine foreclosure or painful tradeoff is forced. The tightening is sufficient for this mode, though consequences feel comfort‑skewed. The final act arises from protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure coheres but remains gentle: outage urgency, a faint hum to follow, and the choice to step out. The decisive intensification is fitting the fragment into the spindle, yet opposition is minimal and the price of visibility is not dramatized. Escalation reads as density and glow rather than narrowing options or forced trade‑offs. The result is resonant but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are intimate (methodology and philosophy of intervention); escalation occurs via density and cadence rather than confrontation. The mycelium’s touch and slow greening function as the single meaningful deepening. However, there’s little tangible price or foreclosed option beyond patience. Tension stays low, so the final welcome of future storms feels earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trading art/meaning for the island’s renewal—is clear and tightens at the exchange. The ritual is a decisive narrowing of options with a felt price, and the convergence’s hum/mist offers a concrete consequence. Pressure is more devotional than adversarial but grows appropriately under the chosen lens. A slightly tidier acceptance of terms keeps it from higher tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are gentle: granting the pilgrim’s safe passage and Lira’s vow to amplify small miracles. Escalation occurs when the pearl weeps and the cave tunes to the pilgrim, but pressure never forces a hard trade‑off. Resolution leans on the cave’s benevolence rather than Lira’s costly choice. The tightening is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on transforming fragments into communal meaning; pressure grows gently via density (more fragments, community convening) and then the summons to a trench. Escalation is real but low‑intensity; prices and foreclosed options are mostly implied. The final decision to leave is agentive but not hard‑won in scene. Tension is lyrical rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    There is a clear dominant stake (finding the fortress) and a meaningful tightening at each threshold. However, pressure is mostly invitational; doors open rather than test resolve beyond the act of daring. The decisive act (using the punch) is hers, but visible price and narrowing options are light. Tension operates more as deepening wonder than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—sculpting a space for reflection by translating entangled memories—tightens as the tile’s patterns escalate from rearranging to verse to a “final stanza” that seals calm. Agency is steady (choosing to place, read, write, and finally to keep the sanctum). The cost is subtle—accepting stewardship and vulnerability—rather than a hard trade‑off or lost option, which limits peak pressure. Still, the cadence shift at completion and vow reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether he will remain in immortal stasis or pivot into the unknown; pressure coheres via the storm’s clock and the lattice’s fragility. The meaningful tightening occurs when he refuses speech (to avoid fracturing the lattice) and presses the amulet, collapsing corridors into a tunnel. Escalation is lyric rather than combative, with cost mostly internal; it reads, but lightly. A more palpable loss or risk on crossing would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (asylum proof) is signaled and pursued through the tactic of “waiting actively” until a perceptual breach occurs. Escalation occurs as atmospheric density increases and the ink begins to answer, but resistance is minimal and options never truly narrow beyond “wait versus act.” The resolution is protagonist‑driven but too frictionless, with little visible sacrifice beyond patience and the liquefaction of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving/bridging time’s textures amid silence) remains largely abstract; escalation is a density build rather than a pressure turn. The main tightening is dawn’s crest and the notepad’s closing, which reweights rather than forecloses options. No concrete loss or reversal tests commitment beyond continued endurance. Effective for lyric mode, but threat and cost stay low.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is coherent (making the erased visible); escalation deepens via the label’s unfolding functions and the tide’s activation. The turn (murals manifesting) reweights options and knowledge. However, tangible price and foreclosed paths are understated; the commitment reads as purpose found more than a sacrifice exacted. Tension is contemplative rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (decode the universal riddle), and pressure deepens via pattern density more than opposition. The meaningful tightening is the shell pointing to the ledger and the resultant chord that reframes the quest. However, there’s little felt price or narrowed options—no credible loss or trade‑off on the page. Resolution is internal and smooth rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear early (privatization vs. communal autonomy) and escalate coherently as the network quietly restructures the city before investors arrive. The tightening is present but low-friction; obstacles never materially threaten the plan, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. The council’s postponement reads earned but easy. Cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—capture a vanishing last thing under a ticking dawn. Escalation arrives via the calibrated chemical countdown aligning with the sun’s rim, creating a single, meaningful tightening. Cost is emotional (loss of the mineral to colonies, elegiac acceptance), though external resistance is minimal. The quietness works, but a sharper on‑page tradeoff could have deepened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—fix the wing before departure and glean guidance—but escalation is gentle. The anchor’s rise provides a soft clock, yet resistance is minimal and the patch works on first application. The price paid is largely conceptual (ongoing work, noted lag) rather than a felt loss. As a result, tension exists but seldom tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early and coherently tightened by a single meaningful deepening: decoding → broadcasting → oncoming thaw. Agency drives the turns; coincidence (falcon timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The cost remains atmospheric—dread, risk of unleashing subterranean streams—rather than a concrete loss or trade‑off. Tension works at sentence and beat scales but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent—rebirth versus silence—and deepen once workers arrive, aligning imagined rhythm with real footfalls. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The on‑page price is mostly in patience and self‑effacement; there’s little friction or resistance that forces tactical change. The rebuild proceeds smoothly, so pressure is felt but not sharpened into a trade‑off beyond the final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: survival versus the ethical choice to share the hush. Escalation tightens when the bioluminescent “unsnarl” forces a trade-off and she lets the beacon die. The cost is legible, though danger slackens quickly once calm descends, softening the squeeze. The outcome leans lyrical more than contested, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is present (redeem the cry‑wolf legacy by guiding others/bodies), but pressure escalates with minimal resistance; success arrives without a testing reversal. The lattice repeatedly solves problems, narrowing felt risk. “Before they find the bodies” gestures at a clock that never tightens tactics. The ending is satisfying but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure accumulates via successive awakenings to a clear tightening: the final payment that requires self‑cost. Stakes (repaying debt through transformation) remain coherent, and the escalation from coaxing leaves to sacrificing self is legible. Lack of a reversal or counterforce limits intensity, but the sacrifice reweights options decisively. The price (erasure) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (transforming ruin to reverence) is clear, but escalation is gentle; the pressure seldom tightens or forces a trade‑off. The guildmasters’ opposition is referenced but occurs offstage, sidestepping a concrete price. The sleepwalking method accrues beauty rather than narrowing options. Resolution arrives smoothly with little felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are legible (restore faith/bridge living and dead), yet opposition is mostly atmospheric and never truly narrows options. Escalation reads as tonal deepening rather than a tightening that exacts a price. The chime and thank‑you resolve without a test that risks failure or loss. Beautiful, but low friction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual; pressure is gentle with minimal narrowing of options. The principal tightening is the hidden address reveal leading to the sealing and launch, with little felt price or credible loss. No antagonist or counterforce tests her commitment beyond execution. Tension is sustained texturally rather than escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (expose conspiracy before the coup) is clear, and one meaningful tightening occurs as the flame’s patterns translate into concrete discoveries, culminating in sending the chart. Escalation is more density than jeopardy; no sharp reversal or on‑page consequence tests her commitment. The courier departure offers a small risk pivot but remains offstage. The price paid is largely opportunity/time, not a felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal stakes escalate via density and ritual amplification (spirits’ volume, larger window, water‑veil), culminating in her allowing the letters to speak. The breeze scattering the apology provides a useful complication re‑woven by spirits. The price is largely emotional and conceptual; no hard trade‑off is confronted beyond release. The tightening is sufficient but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (can she reconfigure a child’s fear into shareable strength) are signaled and deepen as the anesthetic window narrows. Escalation is mostly density/tempo rather than a hard turn: notes “glow,” confessions surface, then the sealing droplet. The visible price is internal and quiet, not a foreclosed path. Effective but soft in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—reviving communal joy—remains largely unopposed; pressure accrues via tone rather than forcing hard trade-offs. The meaningful tightening arrives when she “seals” the mural and lets the fragment dissolve into night, but the price is gentle and abstract. No credible loss or resistance alters tactics. Tension is present but modest, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are internal (comfort vs curiosity), and escalation reads as a density increase: whispers → bells → auroras → heartbeat tone → layered awakenings. The one meaningful tightening is the pedestal’s tone mirroring her heart, prompting the stance shift. Pressure remains gentle—more invitation than force—so the cost feels modest. Resolution is earned but could bear a clearer price or foreclosed alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—protect untaxed thought—stays coherent. Escalation manifests as increased density (seed’s whispers → chant → Loom emergence → Mirabel’s choice), consistent with the accumulative lens. The decisive tightening is Mirabel’s shift to protector and the citywide planting, but the on‑page price remains soft. Tension sits more in mood than in sharpened trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on achieving a transformative armistice between pain and beauty; escalation arrives as density and cadence shift (postcard whispers → bloom). The tightening is meaningful when the nebulae “burst into full bloom,” validating his method and foreclosing isolation via the armistice. Pressure is soft—no explicit trade-off in the moment—so the felt price is largely endurance over time.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates via a pattern break: the first outside traveler arrives, forcing a choice to relinquish a preserved name (the glass orchid) and accept renewed loss. Stakes remain primarily internal and conceptual; the price is endurance and the risk of feelings fading again. The tightening is sufficient for this length but not severe. Resolution feels earned by her recommitment with visible cost (the ritual resumes, regret returns “in a softer shade”).

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (revive trust/covenant) is clear, and pressure coheres through the accumulative decoding sequence. The knot-glyph unsnarling offers the key deepening. However, time pressure (“before paths diverge”) doesn’t materially constrain tactics, and visible cost is mild. Resolution is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are signaled—harmonize preservation and progress—but pressure is gentle, with few obstacles or trade-offs. The single tightening is the decoding and turning of the valve; the world exhales and alignment follows without visible price. Under the accumulative lens, density increases, but a credible loss or foreclosed option is missing. Resolution reads earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accrues through pattern deepening (denser trails, expanding chorus, chip brightening) and a meaningful commitment (attaching chip slivers to living birds). The price is felt conceptually (risk to relic, acceptance of wither) rather than dramatized harm, keeping tension quiet. One clear tightening suffices under the chosen lens. Stakes are coherent but never razor‑edged.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (to find/understand thresholds and exit loss) is clear, and escalation occurs via the hidden seam and deepening in the corridor. Agency drives turns (pressing copper, reading grain, choosing to return). Yet pressure remains soft; no concrete foreclosed path or tangible risk tests commitment. The visible price at climax is more symbolic than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure is gentle: “until sunrise” sets a clock, and the descent to the instrument chamber is a textural escalation. Conflict is largely internal and unopposed; stakes (belonging/knowledge) never face a concrete threat or trade-off. The ritual succeeds without reversal or cost beyond passing time. The cadence shift at dawn reads but doesn’t bite.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are focused (restore vanishing paths/bridge) and escalate through an intensifying pattern of readings culminating in the fissure and the “final seed.” Agency drives the turn, but resistance is soft—no reversal or meaningful loss complicates the path. The tightening is real but gentle, with cost implied rather than paid. The resolution feels earned within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure gently deepens (second bishop; ink making an X that cues the song), but the stakes never bite and no option is foreclosed. The tide’s “answer” relieves pressure rather than raising it. Escalation is primarily tonal and imagistic; cost never sharpens beyond the ephemeral. The applause resolves without a test that forces a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (can she bind the cosmic verse) are signaled and pursued, with a clear tightening when she commits—placing the speck on her palm and letting it melt into ink. Pressure grows by pattern and ritual rather than antagonism; there’s no strong reversal or failure beat. The price—self‑marking, relinquishing pure solitude—is implied but not sharply tested. Still, agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal (can the ritual reprice the ordinary with meaning?), and pressure escalates subtly via density of pattern and light. There’s no hard turn or narrowed option—only a deepening, so tension remains low. The “ledger balancing” image suggests consequence but doesn’t exact a visible price. Quiet works here, but it limits propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear—whether she will expose the bargain to enlighten others—and escalate modestly from solitary reflection to public act. The meaningful tightening is her decision to open the box before the villagers. Pressure remains mostly internal and lyrical; material resistance is minimal, keeping the cost soft. The resolution is protagonist-driven and coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stakes are clear (revive communal hope via understanding the gauge), but pressure remains gentle; experiments progress without a meaningful setback or narrowing of options. The largest balloon reaching zero reads as a smooth culmination rather than a test with visible cost. Escalation is present as density and scale, not as tightening trade‑offs, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular (hear the walls’ dreams) and escalate gently via discovery to a low, resonant hum that reweights understanding. The pressing of the negative to the wall is the clearest tightening beat. Costs and foreclosed options are implied rather than dramatized, so tension stays lyrical more than pressurized. Resolution arises from endurance and attention rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled (convince mirrors), and escalation occurs via the compressing hush and impending bell. Yet opposition is abstract; there’s little risk or loss if he fails, and no visible price to succeed. The decisive turn (bell toll → doors) feels more like release than earned trade‑off. Tension is atmospheric rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: win peace now or perpetuate the “forever war.” Escalation is modest—a chieftain’s approach and the public reading of clauses—before the group lays down swords; resistance feels a bit too smooth. The visible price is renunciation and public vulnerability. A slightly sharper test or near-failure beat would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving an echo—is clear and pressured by the timing of the thunder lull and the fragility of the egg. Escalation is a steady tightening (the hush, the click, the fracture) rather than a reversal; it suits the lens but limits felt jeopardy. The price is primarily moral/conceptual; little is endangered in the moment beyond the ritual’s success. Still, agency drives the peak beat cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled early (disrupt conformity’s lullaby) and escalation occurs via the progressive untangling to the final thread. Yet pressure is soft: no credible obstacle pushes back, and no option is foreclosed. The decisive turn (releasing the golden strand) reads inevitable rather than costly. Tension is more atmospheric than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal—can she reframe her practice ethically—and escalation is a gentle tightening (arrangement, ember flare, insight). The pressure reads coherent under the accumulative lens but lacks a sharp cost or foreclosed option on the page. The “meteor hush” buffers conflict rather than sharpening it, making the turn feel contemplative more than tested. The result is satisfying but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether ephemeral homage can endure, tightened by the migration’s end and the approaching sunrise that will dissolve the structures. Escalation is quiet but present: collecting the wing → building signals → last monarch passes → final knot and dawn’s dimming. The price (accepting impermanence, relinquishing tangible monument) is legible. A sharper on-page stressor or trade-off would raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (preserve names), and density increases as tones spill into a choir; however, opposition is minimal and success feels assured. The meaningful tightening is the rope’s reconfiguration catalyzing the release of names, but the piece lacks a hard trade‑off or foreclosed option on the page. The traveler’s late beat deepens scope, not pressure. Cost remains mostly symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent (interpret the forest’s will; renew a decaying directive) and the storm provides a soft clock. The tightening beat is her choice to place and activate the seal, leading to the directive’s rewriting. The escalation is more tonal than consequential, with limited on‑page price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (seal the covenant) is clear and escalates modestly via the between-regimes window and astronomical alignment. The decisive turn occurs at the third watch; options narrow, but resistance is soft. Consequences are largely positive and unopposed, lowering perceived cost. Pressure is coherent but not tense.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible (release resentment), but pressure scarcely tightens; once Kovan softens, the rest proceed smoothly. The night window provides a gentle clock, not a squeeze. The resolution is essentially uncontested persuasion aided by a benevolent artifact. Emotional cost is implied rather than sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake and deepens as the ritual succeeds, with the key tightening when the luminous thread coils and requires precise synchronization. However, resistance is minimal and success feels relatively unopposed. The price paid is more vow/attention than loss, softening escalation impact. Still, agency clearly drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (repair lenses/bridge wisdom) is clear, with a modest tightening when the ribbon snag births the repair tactic. Pressure remains gentle; there’s minimal resistance or trade‑off beyond patience and care. Resolution depends on agency but without a palpable price or loss on the page. The escalation reads as deepening pattern rather than a hard narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres as a deepening: inquiries fail → tactic shift to bathrooms → culminating act of pressing the cameo with the price of relinquishing linear memory. Stakes are dominantly conceptual but legible and escalate through pattern intensification. The cost is more intellectual than visceral, yet it narrows identity options credibly under the textural lens. No antagonist; agency drives the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent and singular (recover the library), with one meaningful tightening at the locked vine-door. Escalation is largely solved by Selene’s preparedness; resistance is elegant but low-friction. Prices are conceptual rather than felt, tempering tension. Agency drives turns, yet there’s little jeopardy beyond puzzle-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are legible (recover verses to access the garden), but pressure rarely tightens; obstacles yield immediately once she applies the chosen tactic. The key “turn”—inserting the card and opening the ink portal—works, yet no option is foreclosed or loss incurred. Success feels assured; the backward ink river complicates texture more than it tests resolve. The ending’s shift is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the paradox to achieve clarity—is signaled early and pursued through concrete tactics. The meaningful tightening occurs as the seam ignites and the rope’s final braid triggers the dissolution. Yet resistance is minimal; success arrives without setbacks or trade-offs beyond the communal cost of the frozen clock. Pressure holds coherently but never truly bites at Mara’s limits.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—restore balance to the caves—but escalation is linear and largely unopposed. The single tightening (decoding ice to access the stone) resolves smoothly without reversal or visible loss. The energy beings’ pressure is atmospheric rather than coercive. The resolution feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are stated—rekindle to prove meaning—but escalation is gentle and largely unopposed. The rekindling succeeds without cost or a narrowing of options; the caravan’s arrival eases pressure rather than testing resolve. Coincidence functions as solution rather than complication. The final vow adds scope but not strain.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (proving/embodying a model of collective memory to shape identity) is clear, and pressure coheres as the fog thickens, lanterns shift shadows, and noon resonance reveals a pattern. The meaningful tightening is knowledge-based rather than peril-based, and the price is largely conceptual. Escalation functions, but with muted consequence. The resolution is earned by attention and endurance rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal (resist despair) and escalate through density: wind, ignition, sparks, reveal, burst. There is one meaningful deepening—the mosaic’s manifestation and glow—but pressure lacks a clear foreclosed option or explicit trade‑off. Agency is present in lighting the knot and choosing to persist. The felt price is ongoing commitment rather than on‑page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual: decipher the pause to anticipate a turn in negotiation. Pressure builds modestly (owl ripple → cicada vibration → leaders’ heavy words → held breath), and the cadence shift at the cicada’s glow is the meaningful tightening. The price—surrender of pride—lands, but the protagonist’s own risk remains minimal. The conflict never bites hard enough to foreclose options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harvest pure silences—faces a real constraint via the hour and the “limit exposure” tactic to avoid tangling filaments. Escalation is a density deepening rather than reversals: filaments sprout and branch, the clock narrows options, then gravity snaps back. Cost appears as chosen restraint and loss (filaments dissolving), but external opposition is minimal. Tension is steady and coherent, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are modest (communal calm), but pressure coheres and deepens via pattern: noise → counter-tones → storm glass escalation → cascade → docking. Agency remains active and continuous, yet no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond the vial’s depletion. Tension is mostly tonal; one decisive intensification suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are stated—find the stair by sunrise, claim balance—but pressure seldom tightens beyond discovery. The single escalation is informational (murals to stair) rather than a real narrowing of options or trade‑off. No reversal or loss demands adaptation; success feels assured. Sunrise functions more as backdrop than a live constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around the choice to cross: encroachment → tapping opens veins → passage shimmers → he steps through and surrenders the ring. Cost and narrowing are explicit (burned bridges; no retreat). Escalation reads as a cadence intensification rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for the selected lens. Stakes remain internal but felt through ritual and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust and submit the bolt—is clear and faces a decisive test in the chamber. The glitchy texts escalate pressure and the diamonds’ conditionality provides a conceptual cost. However, the internal risk (being used again) is resolved without a true loss or painful trade‑off on the page. Escalation is clean but not punishing, landing more as wonder than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are coherent (uncover the hidden truth), and there’s one meaningful tightening as vibrations guide Lian to the compartment. However, resistance is minimal; discovery proceeds smoothly without credible risk or trade‑off on the page. The cost is introspective rather than pressured, which softens escalation. Tension operates more as wonder than as conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure builds through ritual attempts: deciphering the control panel, coaxing vapor into forms, and the decisive “unsnapping” to release the script. Stakes remain internal (purpose vs. isolation) but the escalation is clear, culminating in a renunciatory merge with the orchard. The cost is felt, though the conflict runs lyrical-soft rather than knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are quiet but clear: can forgotten lives be made legible and seen. Escalation deepens texturally—from discovery to institutional acknowledgment (supervisor’s agreement) to recommitment with a new file. The price is subtle (enduring grief; choosing attention as labor), which limits intensity but suits the lens. One meaningful tightening occurs at the supervisor scene, then consolidates in the final recommitment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible (break indifference via a citywide broadcast), and the singular tightening is the moment she commits to insert the key and transmit. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric—no live resistance or material obstacle escalates cost. The pressure rises texturally, not through a concrete narrowing of options. The result is satisfying but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are stated as vast, but pressure on the page remains serene; obstacles don’t tighten beyond the decision to whisper and sustain it. There’s one meaningful deepening (whisper refracted into a choir that erases code), yet no felt trade-off or narrowing of options under duress. The outcome feels assured once the method appears, reducing escalation. The cost reads as gentle renunciation rather than a tested price.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—translating the forest’s message to earn belonging/pact—is clear, with one meaningful deepening (leaf ignition → hidden spring → sealing monument). Pressure grows by accumulation rather than opposition; no live option is forcefully foreclosed. The cost remains light; success arrives without real threat or trade-off on the page. Still, agency drives each step, keeping tension present if subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—choosing improvisation/uncertainty—tightens as she moves from test to inscription to pledge. The main turn is committing to the fissure and brazier; the decisive shift is trusting the compass’s direction and retooling her craft. Pressure is steady but soft; no harsh trade-off or explicit loss, which keeps the cost modest. Still, agency drives the escalation rather than coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible, and the tightening arrives when naming triggers the coin’s response and commits her to the seam. Pressure grows more by cadence and intention than by obstacles, with minimal risk or opposing force. The choice to exceed “what any textbook declared possible” hints at cost but isn’t tested by a credible threat of failure. Resolution is earned yet gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (coaxing sorrow into release) is clear, and escalation occurs via density and cadence rather than opposition, culminating in the risk of offering laughter. The decisive action (telling the joke) resolves smoothly, with limited resistance or trade-off on the page. Pressure grows, but options never feel meaningfully narrowed beyond the chosen tactic. The price is mostly emotional and understated.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is early and clear (find the equation/mercy), with a meaningful tightening at the clearing and the “final surge.” The cost is felt (skin‑searing flashes; endurance as agency), and options narrow to a ritualized acceptance of pain to earn insight. Mostly internal conflict, but pressure coheres and escalates under the chosen lens. A slightly tidy epiphany softens the edge but does not undercut stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and the pressure deepens when the pattern alignment triggers the chain and the fragment is relinquished. Conflict is largely internal and ceremonial; escalation is modest but consistent with the accumulative design. The loss of the heirloom provides the felt price, but there’s minimal jeopardy or resistance on the way to success. One sharper obstacle or potential misread beat would have tightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—reveal what the ceiling hides and honor the ghosts—are legible from the start and compress through the attic hatch and hidden mechanism. The meaningful tightening arrives when the mainspring drives the circuit to map the hidden architecture, translating atmosphere into actionable constraint. Resolution is earned by her choices, though the price paid is light and the opposition never truly bites back. Tension is steady rather than knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent—risking rupture to capture eternity—and escalation arrives via density shifts: whisper → ink → crack → cascade → lattice. Agency drives the turn (her method and the press slam), but the danger mostly resolves into wonder, dulling felt price. One meaningful tightening occurs (choosing to trigger destabilization), yet tension is more atmospheric than pressurized. Consequences are reconfigurative rather than harming, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving the dispute by converting it into a shared cultural project—tightens via the rare temporal window and the deliberate veiling of mirrors. Escalation is tasteful but gentle; the elders’ resistance dissolves quickly, muting cost and tension. Lira’s agency drives the turn, and the cadence shift at the alignment is effective. A sharper price or harder pushback would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (prevent the chamber’s sorrowful drowning of the town) is signaled early, and time pressure with midnight provides the tightening. The escalation remains smooth and mostly unopposed; there’s no reversal that extracts a visible price. The “tethering” works on first attempt, so tension is more atmospheric than adversarial. Earned resolution, but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure steadily deepens (quiet vibration → rising chorus → staircase → crystal → vortex), and Mara’s agency drives the progression. The dominant stake is spiritual/epistemic rather than survival, and the visible price is modest (conceptual surrender, possible loss/repricing of the compass). Escalation reads as density/cadence shift more than narrowing options, which fits the chosen lens but keeps tension soft. A single hard trade‑off or constraint would have sharpened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain largely artistic and internal; pressure grows via process but never bites hard. The meaningful tightening is the shift from a single figure to a layered tableau, yet no option is foreclosed with visible cost beyond effort. The storm softens rather than compounds pressure, and the lantern aids rather than resists. Tension is gentle, which limits escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal and steady—reckoning with a lifelong question—but pressure escalates modestly via discovery rather than hard choice. The meaningful tightening is the postcard alignment that unlocks the lenses; beyond that, risks or trade‑offs remain abstract. Cost is emotional, not situational or relational. The resolution feels earned for a lyric piece yet lacks a concrete price that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible (liberate suppressed testimony) and escalate through access hurdles and discovery. The parley condition, the coded debris work, and the descent create forward pressure, but risk and loss feel managed rather than dangerous. The “retro‑trap” promises constraint yet imposes little on‑page cost beyond method selection. Resolution is earned but light on a visible price that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (revival without false magic) is clear and escalates via refusal → interrogation of the bottle → blueprinting → bloom. Pressure accrues as density rather than opposition, with one meaningful tightening when he rejects “soothing lies” and opens the sealed bottle by memory. The price reads as patience and renunciation, not a contested loss. Tension is steady but soft, lacking a hard test under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether Harel absorbs or alters the prophecy’s charge in line with his archival duty. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: accidental prophecy → children’s memory as decoding lens → recognition of the loop → sealing the line. The price is contemplative, not acute; no live option is dramatically foreclosed beyond embracing the burden of preservation. Still, the single deepening turn is clear and coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (reopen the covenant; accept guardianship) are legible and deepen as the vortex thickens and the atrium melts. The key tightening is her surrender of the cap—foreclosing a path of holding back. Cost remains largely conceptual and lyrical, so tension never fully bites. Nonetheless, escalation coheres under the chosen lens and resolves via her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—enabling the storm’s “true voice” for the solstice—stays coherent, and pressure tightens through the adhesive clock and sensor calibration. The zero-hour pattern acts as the decisive intensification, but external opposition is minimal and the risk feels low. The felt price is largely conceptual (tradition vs. listening). Solid escalation for a quiet piece, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract, with escalation arriving via the vow and the ground’s answering tremor. The pressure tightens once, but visible cost is modest and there’s little that forecloses options beyond chosen devotion. No antagonist or counterforce tests the resolve beyond atmosphere. Effective for a quiet piece, but the tension never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the covenant or risk a scream that shatters the world—is legible, and pressure deepens when the ghost patterns match the box, compelling the decoding and alignment. The decisive move (placing and aligning the box) forecloses breaking the covenant, with a felt conceptual price (choosing silence over revelation). Escalation is more devotional than oppositional; absence of a counter‑force tempers urgency. Still, the single tightening suffices under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are signaled (rediscover before “the last grain of sand”), and escalation proceeds via density: ledger → cipher → hourglass → reassembly → activation. Tension tightens once (the urn clicks and the system lights), but the path offers little resistance or price beyond conceptual reweighting. Agency is present and resolves the problem, though the lack of a visible loss or trade-off keeps pressure moderate. The result feels earned yet soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (can he coax harmony without erasing incompleteness) is clear, and the gust/kite‑snap supply a credible perturbation. Escalation is modest: ripples → ritual actions → deepened hush. The cost is more philosophical than felt; no real foreclosed option beyond “fixing” is dramatized. The tightening works under an accumulative lens but lacks a palpable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stakes are clear (time limit and the bid to create interspecies dialogue), and the ritual action leads to a public inflection point. Yet the pressure curve is gentle; resistance is largely absent, so escalation feels like steady accretion rather than a tightening that forces a trade‑off. The council’s shift reads earned by accumulation, not by a testing turn with visible price. The felt cost at the peak remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (understanding vs awe) is legible and tightens via the returning vibration aligning with the amber’s signature. The apex (devices flicker; tower “breathes”) is a true intensification, but opposition is diffuse and cost modest. Escalation is primarily density and cadence rather than a pressured trade‑off; still coherent under the accumulative lens. The whisper‑offer is agency, if low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—rekindling life with accuracy and reverence—but escalation is gentle. The warbler’s C‑sharp and the gull’s answering trill are the closest to turns; sprouts appearing provide the beat of payoff. The cost lens is contemplative, not hard‑edged; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond the acceptance that the reef won’t return. Effective for a lyric mode, but tension never tightens past serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are intimate and legible but escalate softly; the riddle produces forward motion without credible resistance. The dominant pressure (can he find and bear the leaf’s burden?) never tangibly threatens failure; the chest yields easily. The cost is mostly conceptual—shouldering voices—rather than contested on the page. One concrete loss, risk, or trade‑off would markedly increase tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a navigational principle after shutdown—is clear and tightens when the sketch aligns with the compass and unlocks the glimpse. Pressure is gentle but coherent; the deck’s field and the anniversary ritual create a single meaningful deepening that shifts options (from confusion to a map of possibilities). Cost is understated; the piece prioritizes stance crystallization over jeopardy. The final choice (to continue navigating by an “invisible true north”) reads earned but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible—lift the curse and access ancient knowledge—but opposition is soft and largely atmospheric. The ritual proceeds without reversal or concrete obstruction; each swap advances without friction beyond cold and time. There is a meaningful tightening at the final queen/king exchange, but little visible price paid. The ending’s warm release reads earned but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on rescuing small gestures from oblivion; escalation is a density increase (ritual leads to discovery, then to healing intent). The click/compartment is the meaningful turn; the second pattern deepens rather than reverses. Cost is primarily conceptual and vocational rather than peril-based. Pressure coheres but never pinches painfully, keeping intensity in the strong-but-quiet band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around the internal stake: endure pain to access home’s map; escalation arrives when she “presses the feather deeper,” triggering the new corridor and the book. Agency drives each turn, and the return of the stone is a meaningful renunciation. The price is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than concrete, keeping the intensity refined rather than gripping. Still, the single tightening is clear and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and early; escalation arrives through the threshold test, the internal confrontations, and the altar choice. The tightening is mostly inward; the labyrinth’s pressures steer him into successive reckonings. Cost is present but gentle—no strong reversal or failed attempt before success. Effective, if not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—securing forgiveness by paying a price—is clear, and pressure coheres via the ticking ritual and the deepening hush. Escalation is primarily density (more voices, glowing mural, spire flicker) rather than opposition, so the felt risk stays modest. The visible cost is conceptual and communal, which lands but lacks a sharp foreclosed option. Still, Mara’s agency drives the tightening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mend the world/self at the edge of oblivion—is clear; pressure coheres as the sea threatens and her narrative must hold. Escalation arrives through density and cadence rather than event turns, culminating in the workshop’s lullaby ceasefire. The visible price is modest; no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond relinquishing fear. Still, the tightening is felt when the charm is aligned and the narrative becomes a bulwark.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (honor the hidden promise) is clear, and one meaningful deepening occurs with the reveal sequence and the chest opening. Escalation is gentle; danger or loss doesn’t sharpen the decision beyond lyric awe. The final recommitment forecloses a more ordinary life, but that price stays conceptual. Pressure coheres, yet never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are intimate: will her softened intent truly reach farther and guide a life? Escalation is a single meaningful tightening—placing the cork, then cracking it—to an on‑page payoff (boat arrives, sea sighs). The price is felt but modest; no option is sharply foreclosed beyond expending the cork’s charge. Coherent pressure for this scope, though comparatively low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—turning loss into navigable current—and tightens as the engine is assembled and stabilized under moon‑phased constraints. The price (absorbing sorrow, fatigue, foreclosing outward messaging to become an inward beacon) is felt if understated. Escalation reads as density/cadence: whispers to roar to steady hum to ships. A single, sharper on‑page sacrifice would elevate stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is legible early, and the concealment choice is the one meaningful tightening. However, the smugglers offer minimal on-page pressure; greed evaporates at a glance, undercutting escalation. The price of forcing communal reflection is not tested in-scene, so tension resolves too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are intimate—whether he can decode and honor a stranger’s final gesture—and the pressure coheres as pattern recognition deepens. Escalation is a measured cadence shift (the realization that pauses equal memory) rather than a hard narrowing of options. The price paid is modest but present: he commits to witnesshood over isolation’s safety. A single meaningful tightening occurs, but a bolder on‑page cost would lift intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise and confront the doorway—tightens through the rising creek and the corridor’s emergence. The decisive turn is the refusal to step through, which forecloses one path; however, pressure remains more numinous than coercive, with low palpable risk. Escalation is coherent and grows, but the price remains conceptual, not materially testing him. Effective, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (end the dream cycle) is clear, but pressure is gentle; obstacles do not contest her beyond awe and doubt. The meaningful tightening occurs at the orb’s presentation and her decision to kiss it. The cost feels light—no tested sacrifice or trade that forecloses a cherished option. Escalation relies on density and wonder rather than resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are gentle and largely internal; escalation is a deepening cadence rather than true pressure. The key turn is the ritual’s success and the vow, with little opposition or narrowing of options. The “skeptics await” note hints at future stakes but doesn’t apply on-page pressure. Earned, but low heat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—make coherence under the pressure of mortality—tightens through the dream flight/fox dissolution and the grave’s reinterpretation. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than a reversal, fitting the lens. The choice to translate jealousy into ink and to step outside forecloses resignation. The price is the acceptance of lost innocence and the persistent ache of nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds via a density increase: fog as filter → synchronization ritual → water chime and outside mother, reweighting the stake of “ordinary miracles.” Still, the conflict is largely internal and devotional, with scant threat or foreclosed path beyond the cost of enduring emptiness (anosmia). One meaningful deepening occurs when she aligns the screw to the pendulum, but the price is understated. The resolution is earned by stance, not by contested reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure accrues through controlled actions—the insertion of the quill, the shards’ flare, the timed release of breath—culminating in the transformation. Stakes stay focused on whether she can shed old weight and repurpose pain; the decisive tightening is the held breath and its release. Cost is felt but quiet (renunciation rather than confrontation). The escalation is restrained yet clear under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is coherent and tight: reach Mara with an apology before the orchard’s silence closes. Escalation arrives as density and cadence—each ritual step deepens commitment and risk, culminating with the axe’s fall and the apology released. Cost is felt through vulnerability and irrevocable loss (the orchard), though no hard reversal tests resolve. The pressure is steady rather than jagged, but it tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (seeing through cosmic illusions) remain coherent and escalate via ritual intensifications culminating in the vortex. Agency drives turns, yet opposition is largely atmospheric; pressures don’t force a painful trade‑off beyond the implied self‑erasure. The tightening is real (density and cadence shift) but the price isn’t viscerally tested. Effective, not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: he must time the flow and catch the horizon’s pause by a ritualized backward count. The meaningful tightening is the countdown to zero and the risk of misalignment (“slightest misalignment would shatter the delicate rhythm”), though no overt loss occurs. Agency is attention and calibration, culminating in the release and realization. Stakes remain internal and conceptual rather than materially costly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (protect the farm) with a meaningful but modest tightening at the storm. Agency drives the calibration and response, yet the price and risk read low, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Tension is sustained more by atmosphere than consequence. The resolution is competent rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—reconciling rigor with chance via the map quest—and tightens at the lantern/mica activation beat. Escalation is steady but low‑risk; few options are foreclosed, and consequences remain largely conceptual. Agency drives each step, avoiding coincidence‑driven resolution. The cost is gentle, so the peak lacks bite even as it resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether Mara sustains estrangement or permits communion; escalation accrues via the chorus of voices and crystallizes at the unsolicited “Thank you.” The tightening is real but subtle, with limited on-page resistance or competing options. The final choice reweights her stance but carries a soft, mostly implied price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (renew the covenant to guide the harbor) and escalate texturally via encroaching tide and rising chant. The meaningful tightening is the tide’s turn and the need to “renew through proximate causes” before context shifts. Still, pressure never forces a painful trade‑off; the cost is reverential rather than biting. The resolution is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are unified (find a cure for loneliness) and the puzzle provides a concrete pressure point. Escalation is gentle: cutting the ivy yields the rock and the chime, with little resistance or sacrifice on the page. The decisive act—sending the fragment onward—narrows one option but doesn’t extract a visible price beyond relinquishment. Tension is more tonal than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reach the stillpoint to chart inner seas) is signaled early and escalates through melody → crescendo → pure tone. The turn is clear at the bark and step through, but costs and foreclosed options remain gentle. Agency drives the outcome, yet pressure never truly threatens failure or trade‑off. The result satisfies quietly rather than tests conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (correct the seeded error/stabilize the anomaly) is present, but pressure rises gently and resolves with limited resistance. The key tightening is the pen’s active revision of the hologram and the anomaly easing; there’s little foreclosed alternative or price paid. Agency exists (choosing to weave new connections), yet success comes quickly. Tension remains mostly tonal rather than peril‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure builds as Arlen decides to “disrupt” the harbor’s rhythm and commits to a method that could fail; Lira’s reprise carries the stake forward. However, escalation is tonal rather than consequential: no option is truly foreclosed, and risk remains abstract. The cadence shift at the moon’s zenith provides one meaningful tightening consistent with the lens. Costs are implied (forgetting/erasure) rather than incurred on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and deepens once the vandalized self‑portrait reframes the hunt as self‑reckoning. The art‑trail provides a single meaningful tightening, and the ending forecloses the path of destruction. Pressure remains coherent but soft; obstacles are minimal and no beat forces a hard trade beyond the internal renunciation. Cost is felt but mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres as the garden’s response intensifies, culminating in institutional change, though external resistance remains largely off‑stage. The dominant stake—transforming cold observation into communal care—tightens via Lira’s agency (escalating drumming, climbing higher). Costs are implicit rather than felt by Lira; the lab’s sacrifice is declared rather than dramatized. Still, the cadence shift (aurora, orbs) reads as a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are coherent—prove a whisper’s reach—but pressure remains gentle, with no true opposition or loss forcing trade‑offs. The meaningful tightening is the map’s path leading to A‑12 and the hidden tunnel, which deepens options more than it narrows them. Resolution follows from agency, yet without a visible price beyond effort and risk under the storm. Tension is steady, not escalating to a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can the guardian teach darkness to hold its stars. Escalation reads through density and cadence (ripples to lattice; shutters slowing), with a clear intensification when the mirror aligns with the moon. Consequence/cost remains gentle and abstract, so pressure never quite tightens into a hard trade‑off. Resolution feels earned through attention rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes—culture of rote learning vs. quiet curiosity—are declared and aesthetically escalated by the synchronized displays, but concrete resistance never materializes. The mayor’s turnaround arrives without friction, and no option is truly foreclosed on the page. Pressure increases by density of image rather than narrowing choices. The ending’s stance is clear but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freedom vs. protective attachment—tightens once with the island’s reveal and the crystal’s test. Escalation proceeds, but opposition is soft; each attempt largely succeeds without meaningful setback. The price (releasing the scrimshaw, renouncing violence) lands yet feels unopposed, reducing pressure. A single credible complication before the whale’s intervention would have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—making space for sorrow within an enforced‑joy regime—is clear, with one meaningful deepening as narration and turbines intensify and culminate in the baton/bouquet pact. Escalation is primarily cadence and density, not reversals, but it coheres under the chosen lens. The price is a quiet path that skirts rebellion, with implications of risk and isolation. Still, pressure remains largely internal and could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (can art rewrite the lake’s binding?) is present, and escalation occurs through the colonnade’s response and the “crack” of prohibitions. However, pressure is gentle; no option is truly foreclosed, and risk remains abstract. The key turn (paraphrasing the chant) faces little resistance. The final cadence shift reads assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on unlocking beauty despite sensory limits; escalation occurs via denser barters (rosemary/cactus, ivy/lotus) leading to the full awakening and glass blossoming. The tightening is a cadence shift rather than a hard foreclosure, and the price remains gentle. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives each step, and the final choice—to honor imperfection as method—resolves the pressure coherently under the accumulative lens. Lack of a sharper irreversible trade limits peak charge.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (forging connection) is legible and escalates texturally via successive notes and synaptic sparks. The main tightening is the mind’s responsive sigh/heartbeat sync, which reweights the ritual. However, prices and foreclosed options remain soft; pressure never bites hard. The resolution is earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (renewal) is signaled early, and there’s one meaningful tightening when she trials the method on the wilted rose and it answers. Escalation is primarily tonal/density-based rather than pressure-based; resistance remains low. The later arrival of visitors and blossoming gardens extends consequence but doesn’t add new strain. Closure feels earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on extracting a pattern to guide rebuilding, but escalation remains gentle. The tightening moments (cards flaring when tape crosses glyphs, the hum at corridor intersection, the tape’s snap) deepen pattern recognition without forcing a hard trade-off. Agency is present yet largely contemplative; the cost of her choice is conceptual and mild. The resolution is earned by ritual persistence rather than pressure that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (access/transform through forbidden knowledge) escalates as he commits to irregularity and the pagoda responds. The meaningful tightening is the light cascade that forces a revaluation of “purify” and accepts cost. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens, though one more concrete hazard or near-failure could sharpen the tradeoff. Resolution derives from his agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (capturing/understanding the “shadow unbound” to preserve hope) is clear. Escalation is a deepening, not a squeeze: the method reveals patterns; the stone’s response tightens meaning rather than options. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional, not a hard trade-off, but it does charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing trust via restoring the chameleon—remains steady, but pressure deepening is modest. The “shedding layers” ritual marks the primary tightening, yet there’s no true narrowing of options or on‑page price that alters tactics. The quick assent of the animal and the seamless reintegration soften consequence. Tension exists but doesn’t escalate decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (learn to read scars/seek closure) is clear and deepens via the coffee-ring method and the hourglass release. Escalation is quiet but coherent: investigation → ritual alignment → release. The price paid feels inward and contemplative, with limited visible foreclosed options. No major reversal; the pressure tightens once effectively but remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—tightens through concrete turns: hidden compartment → letters/map → reading a goodbye triggers transformation → liquid film and absorption. Escalation is largely textural, yet each deepening constrains options toward acceptance and release. The visible price is modest but discernible in her self‑flooding and final goodbye. Agency drives the key moves, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating creativity—intensifies through the nightly tracing until the decisive “last star” beat. Pressure rises as the unheard verses grow louder, pushing him to continue despite fatigue. The price is mostly internal (exhaustion, surrendering the instrument), with no antagonist but coherent pressure. Escalation is clear, if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (rekindling life) is clear, but pressure doesn’t tighten through tangible obstacles; the chant succeeds on first try without a real trade‑off. There is one meaningful deepening when the clock finally ticks and reverses time, but few options are foreclosed and no loss or compromise is felt. The cost—remaining dreamless while tending renewal—reads conceptually rather than viscerally. Tension is present in cadence more than in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are internal—will he earn a real shift in how he seeks wonder—and escalation occurs via pattern intensification (lucid translocation → engine activation → dawn/“seventh sense”). The choice to place the gear is the tightening beat that reweights options. Costs are implied more than dramatized; opposition is minimal, so tension is modest. Nonetheless, the density rise creates a credible deepening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: will Mira embrace and enact courage. The ferry’s “indirect routes” and the cave’s test deepen rather than reverse, with the key tightening being the ticket-based opening. Stakes remain more ceremonial than perilous; the price (forsaking passivity) is felt but soft. Resolution is protagonist-driven and earned within the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—what safety costs—is established early and deepens as the bolt prompts the fortress’s response. The tightening is quiet but real: the offering yields the copper shift, aligning the guests’ internal process with the fortress’s rhythm and foreclosing quick escape in favor of bearing silence. Agency is modest (ritualistic endurance over decisive reversal), but the price is legible and informs the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear, and escalation is anchored by the crown touch triggering the sunder and the specter’s exposure. Agency drives the turns, and costs register (temple’s demise; exhausted ink). The pressure could sharpen with a harder trade‑off or near‑failure, but the single decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering missing paths/meaning) is present from the start, with one substantive tightening: the watermark/canyon match and deliberate tapping that yields the coordinate. Pressure remains conceptual; costs are implied (reef loss, directionlessness) rather than dramatized on the page. Escalation is calm and steady, fitting the lens but never truly constricting options.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reigniting a stalled rebellion/meaning) is signaled early and deepens as the hum spreads from glyph to engines to workers. The escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven (listening, tracing patterns), but the visible price is light and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Tension operates more as swell than contest, which suits the lens but limits bite. The final vow crystallizes stance rather than forcing a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (evolve tradition without betraying it) is clear and tightens at the sacrifice beat. The unsealing is a decisive turn with visible cost. Opposition remains soft (elder’s warning offstage, community sways quickly), so tension rises more gently than it could. Agency, not coincidence, drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: can she hold stillness long enough to convert grief into forward motion. Pressure deepens when the photograph returns and she permits a deliberate freeze of grief, then formalizes a vow at the sapling—an escalation in commitment. The price (ongoing pain accepted, path foreclosed against paralysis) is legible. No antagonist, but the accumulative deepening reads coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can he find a way to paint fractured souls—is tightened by the space’s pressure and the cards’ reassembly. The meaningful turn is the decision to descend when the walls “close in,” leading to a charged confrontation with fragmentation. The cost is an embrace of necessary darkness and surrender of the old self (phoenix image), though consequences remain mostly internal. Escalation is coherent if gentle, befitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (understanding the crisis-time phenomenon) are singular and coherent, tightening when the ground “dissolves” and Kael’s outline threatens to vanish. Agency drives the central intensification and the final stance (to carry this knowledge out). The price is more conceptual than consequential, keeping escalation strong but not punishing. No antagonist is needed, but a sharper trade-off or loss would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs fragile peace/personal safety—is clear and tightens when the networks awaken and the council convenes. Escalation is coherent but relatively frictionless, with little resistance on the page after the inciting act. The price is gestured (risk of preservation, scandal spreading beyond walls) but not tested in a concrete pushback scene. Still, the pressure meaningfully deepens as whispers become open speech.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (can a pacifist knit continuity after collapse) are legible but pressure escalates gently. The primary tightening is communal action (gathering scraps, the vow); no option is sharply foreclosed, and cost is mostly conceptual. Lack of a hard test or reversal keeps tension low even for a quiet piece. The closure is earned, but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via pattern intensification: pulses → hush → chant → constellation entanglement. The tightening beat is the tangle/tilt and the spike’s skyward aim, which narrows options to a single attempt. Price is implied rather than dramatized—more surrender of control than sacrifice—so tension never fully bites. Still, agency drives the turn, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (expose the ledger’s truth), but escalation is minimal; once at the console, resistance collapses and the discovery arrives without a tightening turn or visible price. The “proof by contradiction” move could have narrowed options, yet it yields immediate success. The siren and journalist’s arrival resolve rather than complicate. Pressure reads elegant but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (quieting guilt by healing the device) is clear and tightens when she discovers and executes the letter‑instructions. Escalation is gentle; the haunted firmware offers pressure but little pushback, so consequence feels soft. Agency drives the turn, but the visible price is minimal, reducing bite. Still, the cadence shift from static dissonance to communal lull is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure deepens but scarcely tightens: once the tile hums in tune with the mandala, success is never contested. Stakes remain internal and abstract, with no live alternative path or visible price. The decisive act (closing the spiral) is clean but low-risk. The violinist’s coda offers echo, not escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can empathy be forged to endure—tightens at the renaming and communal uptake. Pressure is coherent but gentle; opposition is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, so the felt cost remains conceptual. The key turn is protagonist‑driven (naming via the chips) and earns the outcome. A sharper price or lost option would have deepened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—mending the fractured timeline via performance—is clear and tightens through the act of singing and amplifying echoes. Escalation is primarily intensification; the key turn is the shopkeeper’s entrance and wish, which reweights the moment. Agency stems from the ghost’s performance choices, but visible price and opposition are light. Resolution feels earned within the fable logic, though conflict remains low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—can she induce recall sans pill—appears early and guides action, but pressure remains low and largely uncontested. Escalation is a density increase rather than a narrowing of options; no real risk or loss tests her commitment. The “whisper of another mind” is a satisfying intensification but doesn’t exact a visible price. The conflict stays internal and gentle, limiting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (becoming the voice/completing the map) is signaled and deepens through the ritual to a luminous cadence shift. Escalation is mostly density and image rather than narrowing options or visible price. The final droplet is an agency beat, but no path is truly foreclosed. Pressure remains coherent yet gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking and enacting the prophecy—tightens as the echo yields instruction and the buttons must be arranged precisely. The release of the echo and the bridge crossing provide a satisfying cadence shift. However, escalation is more ceremonial than pressurized; visible cost or foreclosed options are muted. Tension is steady but rarely sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (redemption/repair) is clear, with one deepening at the altar and pass. Pressure is internally focused and largely unopposed; steps feel unlocked in sequence rather than earned through hard trade‑offs. The choice to enter the pass is a credible tightening but lacks a concrete price. Consequences read restorative more than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around a quiet stake—will Arlen reach a distilled understanding and be released by the river—and escalates through the live clock toward the fog’s softening. The meaningful tightening is the countdown to silence, but there’s limited risk or foreclosed path beyond internal release. Agency is mostly attentional endurance rather than choice under duress; the turn lands, the cost stays soft. Tension is sentence-level rather than situationally acute.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure grows via density and cadence: the hum syncing with breath, the lantern warming, and the emerging silhouettes. The dominant stake (coaxing life without violating the oasis’s resistance) tightens once when she decides to offer the lantern to the hives. The price is gentle but legible—accepting partial change and giving up the lantern. A sharper trade‑off or threatened failure beat would raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes stay gentle: whether Mara can usher light into shadowed alleys. Escalation appears as a tonal tightening (the hush settling, darkness “recoiling”) rather than as constrained options or losses. The latch click is the closest to a micro turn; no beat threatens failure or exacts a clear price. The resolution is earned but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual; the ritual faces no resistance, and escalation is a steady intensification rather than a pressured turn. The dominant stake is signaled, but options never narrow via on‑page cost. The “hum” and reflections progress smoothly to success, reducing tension. The closing vow feels more ceremonial than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure escalates gently through pattern intensification, but opposition and concrete cost remain abstract. The dominant stake (rejoining/connecting threads) is signaled and resolved, yet no option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond a conceptual shift. The petal placement is a clean turn, but the risk to Mira is low. Tension operates atmospherically rather than through hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (prevent manipulation/unify campus) is clear, but escalation is modest: the false alarm is neutralized swiftly with little pushback. Mara’s agency drives the action, yet few options close or force trade-offs. The community’s transformation feels earned conceptually but light on concrete consequence or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the key) is clear, and pressure coheres as the organ triggers the spatial mutiny and his claustrophobia tightens. The meaningful tightening is his decision to enter the rewriting corridor despite fear. However, obstacles part too readily—no reversal or trade‑off beyond endurance—so the price paid remains modest. The ending is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (recovering the erased) are signaled early and intensify as the child’s name surfaces and the quarry “speaks.” The main tightening is the fissure/revelation, which reweights options rather than forcing a hard trade‑off. Agency is expressed as endurance and attention more than decision, with limited visible loss beyond emotional reopening. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earns the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (retrieve/honor) and tightens when the alarms introduce a concrete external threat. The reversal is Mara’s refusal to flee and choice to embed the nail, which narrows options and accepts risk. The price is present but relatively soft (no immediate injury or loss beyond locking the artifact and facing the storm). Pressure remains coherent under a hybrid causal/situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (activate amnesty to reveal the hitchhiker/forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens at the ascent and first note. Escalation is primarily intensity and pattern, not obstacle; the legend provides a path rather than pressure. The cost is conceptual (accepting a lifelong burden) rather than a live loss on the page. Still, the performance at the summit functions as a meaningful narrowing that triggers the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to code for loops as boundaries versus creative wandering—is present, with one meaningful tightening when Arlen overrules Maya via persuasion and installs markers. Escalation remains mostly tonal and situational; the rise/fall montage lessens on‑page pressure and cost visibility in the middle. The ending’s stance crystallization lands, but the path there is low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding/entry) is signaled early, and there is one meaningful tightening when she chooses to share the burden and commit to the star‑method. Pressure remains gentle; there is no credible resistance or risk beyond relinquishing secrecy, so escalation feels low‑temperature. The opening of the temple resolves cleanly without a trade‑off beyond interior relief. Tension operates more as cadence than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are coherent (recover and safeguard a dangerous truth), and escalation arrives through the ritual’s intensification and the seed’s hungry pulse. However, jeopardy is modest and there’s no strong reversal; the seed’s threat is contained swiftly. The tightening is sufficient but not bracing. Resolution is earned by her choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (unlock and fuse dreams to guide her people) and escalates via ritual milestones. Pressure is coherent but soft—no credible resistance or trade‑off beyond a conceptual burden, so options never feel narrowed by cost. The tightening occurs when the portal opens and she chooses to step through, but the path is relatively frictionless. Earned, but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (heal the self via pact‑charged ritual) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as acts intensify from carving to the card’s placement. The meaningful turn is the root’s shiver/luminescence leading to the hollow and final insertion. However, no clear narrowing or trade‑off is forced; the path feels unopposed and largely assured. The price is more conceptual than felt, muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator reorient after failure—tightens through accumulative pressure (cataloguing as defense, the clatter of concrete, the dusk closing in). The meaningful turn is a stance crystallization: trading the hunger for applause for steady craft, with the closing action (cushioning the record player) embodying that choice. External antagonism is minimal, but internal tension escalates coherently under the chosen lens. The price is subtle but present in the relinquishment of audience‑fed identity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—a proof of transition and balance—is signaled early and tightened when the arbor momentarily reestablishes harmony. Escalation comes through the seed’s activation and the arbor’s cascade, culminating in Lira’s decision to test the valleys. Pressure remains gentle; opposition is minimal and the price of the choice is mostly implied (leaving the arbor’s cradle). Still, the deepening is coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder amid a time rupture) is established and deepens when clocks stall. The librarian’s agency escalates via forging a key of memory and sealing it into the creel; the choice narrows his stance. Pressure remains gentle and mostly conceptual; visible price is limited to a softened self. Tightening occurs, but the felt consequences stay low‑heat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent: transform sealed fear into shared light. Escalation reads as density/deepening—the confessions’ absorption tightens pressure toward the crowning; the external doors’ continued closure marks a price and boundary. The agency is chosen, not coincidental, though the conflict remains more contemplative than fraught. One meaningful cadence shift suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is focused and pressure coheres as the narrator follows a taught pattern toward a vow. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, with one meaningful tightening at the tunnel/river interface leading to the vow. The price is quiet but felt; however, no option is sharply foreclosed on the page, keeping intensity just below the highest band. A sharper trade‑off (what the vow costs next time) would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (find the library), yet obstacles are minimal and doors largely open upon noticing patterns. The key tightening—anticipating reversals via delays—doesn’t force a hard trade-off. The dreamer’s touches trigger progress without setback. Resolution feels earned but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early, and escalation coheres: the coffee reading reveals the empire’s conditional offer, the promise’s glow dims, and the envoy’s presence sharpens the decision. The tightening comes in choosing to channel plant dissent through the violin, foreclosing assimilation. Yet the opposition yields quickly and there’s little on‑page price or tactical adaptation beyond the choice itself. Tension is steady rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and the cadence tightens as the aurora dwindles and the chip flares. However, pressure is soft; there’s no meaningful reversal or foreclosed option beyond the tonal “before oblivion” clock. The cost registers more as reverent exchange than painful trade-off. Escalation remains coherent and culminates in a credible, quiet decision.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes stay intimate and low; pressure deepens once with the sunrise act and lightly again in the storm, but costs are minimal. Agency is steady, not tested: Mara’s choices rarely foreclose meaningful options. The storm sequence hints at practical consequences but resolves smoothly. The cadence shift at the altar is the primary tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent—invite nuance before the decree hardens—and deepen via the shard’s projection and the deliberate unhooking. Pressure escalates texturally (chimes shift; image cracks; knot loosens) toward a single meaningful turn. The cost (embracing uncertainty) reads but remains soft, with little resistance or loss beyond conceptual vulnerability. A touch more friction would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate from contemplation to entry to revelation, with the tightening centered on her chosen restraint and the grotto’s intensifying pull. The meaningful turn is the luminous vortex and her repriced aim. Prices are internal—foregoing immediate seeing, surrendering control—credible but restrained. Lack of sharper jeopardy keeps pressure below peak.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear, but pressure is gentle; the birds’ surge and the resonance alignment serve as the single deepening. There’s little risk or counterforce to test commitment, so the felt price remains abstract. The outcome arrives without a meaningful trade‑off beyond renunciation. One concrete impediment or live alternative would tighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming a quiet, sacred practice) is clear, and the key tightening is the deliberate unstrapping and mist crossing toward the keystone. Escalation is mostly atmospheric; there’s no real obstruction or reversal, so pressure never bites. The resolution stems from Selric’s agency and renunciation, but the price is understated, limiting tension. A single tangible risk or counterforce would have sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is internal—proving a vow—yet on‑page pressure is gentle; obstacles offer little resistance. One tightening occurs at the locked door and the descent into darkness, followed by the choice of the glowing book, but each resolves without trade‑off. The cost at closure is mostly a renewed commitment, not a price paid. Tension remains aesthetic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (achieve alignment) is signaled early and escalates through accumulating decoded pops to the instruction and decisive act. The tightening is primarily textural: density increases until it resolves into a single tone syncing with his heartbeat. The “double‑edged sword” warning and the glass crack hint at cost but don’t force a hard trade‑off. Tension remains internally coherent and grows, if gently, under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres through the accumulative ritual of naming; the chant grows, the aurora forms, and the emotional cost mounts. Escalation is tonal and imagistic rather than adversarial, but it narrows toward the decisive act of speaking the lover’s name. Visible price is internal—letting the burden become a bridge—credible at this length. Slight softness arises from the absence of real hindrance or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and coherent, and escalation reads as a cadence tightening toward alignment. The meaningful turn occurs when irregular droplets settle to a steady pulse and the metal “remembers,” narrowing options to patient continuation. The felt price is chiefly endurance and the risk of shattering faith; no strong reversal or explicit loss limits peak tension. Resolution is protagonist‑driven rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is articulated, and escalation occurs via the sequence of photographs culminating in the public reading. However, pressure remains low: no counterforce or credible loss tests commitment, and options are rarely narrowed. The resolution doesn’t require a difficult trade‑off; it’s acceptance rather than a contested turn. The cost is largely reputational/communal and implied.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens as the ritual intensifies from static flame to pulsing, hiss, exposure, explosion, and ingestion. Escalation is driven by Selene’s methods (channeling starlings, arranging shards), with one decisive deepening at the shard-to-lips beat. The cost remains mostly symbolic—her surrender to awe—so tension never bites hard. Still, the cadence shift at the end credibly reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: keep trust intact under storm pressure. Tightening arrives when he chooses to climb higher to revise the harness after transmission failure; the radio’s late “Hold fast” reweights the effort. The felt price is mainly ongoing duty and exposure rather than a specific sacrifice on the page. Escalation is modest but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled early (Kael’s affect and the clone’s fate), and escalation centers on a single decisive act (the slice). Opposition is present but yields instantly; no reversal tests Kael’s commitment or forces a trade‑off. Cost is minimal and largely positive; the conflict resolves without enduring loss or narrowed options. The piece reads as a controlled cadence lift rather than a true tightening with price.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (will the seed bloom via designed riddles/airflow) is clear, and escalation occurs as ciphers click toward the gust. Yet pressure is low and largely procedural, with little narrowing trade‑off or visible price; success arrives smoothly once puzzles are solved. The lack of a concrete cost keeps tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (revive household laughter) are established early and tighten when the hourglass empties and the “blade of sound” escalates into a vortex before softening. Pressure is mostly internal and environmental; resistance is low but the accumulative intensification and method shift provide a meaningful turn. Costs are implied rather than sharply dramatized. The resolution stems from his chosen method.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—engage the pendant and its risks vs. preserve the archive—tightens once the cultist door risk is introduced. The guardian’s agency drives the deepening (ritual approach, refusal to rush, then opening a wing). The price of waiting is stated rather than pressured in-scene; no hard loss tests the stance. Still, the cadence shift around the pendant’s adoption reads as a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the dominant stake (revive the crozier to seize agency) with a clear tightening at each penny drop and the second, riskier elixir. The successive attempts provide real escalation, and the final eruption reweights options. Still, prices paid are light—no visible loss or renunciation beyond patience and effort. A touch more tangible cost would heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes (revival vs decay) are signaled and the pressure deepens from private tuning to public broadcast, but opposition remains soft and largely conceptual. The most meaningful tightening is the shift from interpreting to broadcasting, which broadens consequences but doesn’t foreclose an option or exact a cost. The perigee clock adds urgency without testing resolve. Satisfying, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (recovering the ferry and sealing time-slips) are clear, but escalation is smooth and largely unopposed. The primary tightening is the radio’s tone initiating the reveal, with no counterforce or complication. Choices don’t foreclose options with a visible price; success arrives without trial. As a result, tension plateaus quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering connection’s texture) is signaled and accumulates through pattern intensification and spatial transformations. Pressure coheres via density increases (eruptions → dissolution → bridge), but price and foreclosed options remain gentle. The crossing is a meaningful tightening, yet without a tangible sacrifice or resistance the stakes feel cerebral. Resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (learning to navigate the abyss by starlight) is legible, but pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested. The test vessel’s success does not force a trade‑off or visible loss; the tightening is more tonal than tactical. Agency is present in method selection and symbolic acts, not in a hard choice under fire. The result is resonant but soft on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular—save a fragile voice—and escalate via a clear tightening (signal intensifies, leads to hidden source, demands synchronization). The price is more conceptual than visceral: taking on the “weight of incidental heroism” rather than risking body or reputation. Agency drives the turn at the alcove and the decision to vow stewardship. A touch more friction or sacrifice on the page would deepen the cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are coherent (risk of being stranded; moral duty to the forgotten) and signaled early, with one meaningful tightening at tide apex. However, pressure never bites back—no setback or forced trade beyond the quiet choice to bury the codex. The danger reads more declared than tested, reducing felt cost. Resolution is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (halt the loop before it overwrites her mind; reclaim her life), and escalation occurs through the ritual’s deepening to the shard’s chime and the ghost’s error. However, pressure rarely bites: no setback or trade‑off tests her commitment and the solution unfolds smoothly. The price paid is mostly conceptual (admitting miscounted beats) rather than a constrained loss. Effective but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and single: bind the echo tunnel and preserve a language’s texture. Pressure tightens via the flock’s pattern and the diamond’s activation, with the decisive sealing as the cost. However, there’s little resistance or reversal; progress is largely linear and ritual-competent. The conceptual price is strong but the on‑page struggle feels low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (transmute sorrow/bitterness) is clear and escalates through intensifying phenomena. The tightening turn arrives with the vine‑raised phone and the arrowhead’s shatter, which forecloses a tool and commits the narrator. Pressure is mostly internal/atmospheric; danger remains low, so the felt risk is modest. Resolution reads earned but comfortably achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (beauty vs. regime control) is clear, and pressure tightens at the statue’s ultimatum and the shell’s activation. Escalation is largely one decisive intensification rather than a layered trade‑off; opposition softens quickly once the note spreads. The price is more symbolic than visceral, muting consequence. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres: a surveillance pass becomes an actionable test of Milo’s plan, and he escalates by unleashing the storm to create a window for the truce. The second drone’s arrival provides a quiet deepening rather than a new obstacle, keeping tensions low. The price paid (using the storm, risking interception) is present but not strongly felt. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the scene could bear a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain largely textural—can silence be turned into motion—and escalate gently via discoveries rather than trial and consequence. Singing triggers responses (gears, fog, hidden compartment, choir), but there’s little narrowing of options or visible price paid. The descent is a deepening, not a pressured trade‑off. Closure is earned tonally, not through sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (reawakening analog memories without disrupting patrons) is signaled early, and pressure mounts via intensifying field to the luminous projection. However, escalation carries minimal risk or trade‑off, and no option is clearly foreclosed. The tightening is primarily textural, not price‑driven. Resolution is earned but soft on consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled (retrieve/translate the runaway dream), with one tightening via the sunrise window and the decision to release the cipher to the wind. Pressure remains gentle; conflict is largely internal and unopposed, with limited cost or narrowed options. Lio’s netting of light is a pretty beat but offers minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (free the trapped idea) is legible, and there’s one meaningful tightening when the wind reveals the groove and forces the careful twist. Escalation remains gentle; disorientation and fear never quite press him into a costly trade‑off. Resolution is protagonist‑driven but consequence is largely symbolic. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (restore collective memory), but pressure rises gently; solutions meet little pushback. The meaningful deepening (sextant shards reflect the mushroom constellation) shifts options yet doesn’t close off an alternative. Resolution is protagonist‑driven but consequence costs remain abstract. One concrete loss or risk would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—ending the library’s reversible exile—is established early and pursued through a tightening pattern (tea → time → altar). Escalation is present but gentle; there’s little counter‑pressure beyond timing and fragility. The artifact’s shattering supplies a small, felt price, yet consequences carry minimal risk to the protagonist. The arc remains satisfying but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are consistently announced (preserve wonder) but pressure is gentle; the storm resolves through effortless song and does not exact a price. There is one real tightening—responding to the traveler with a gift that commits the orchard’s magic outward. The escalation reads as increase in lyric density rather than narrowing options. Consequences feel hopeful and broad, with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—grounding the drowned—sharpens as she confronts each knot; the sanctuary’s hush thickens, pressing toward stillness. Escalation is primarily rhythmic/density‑based; the net’s collapse into a single thread provides the key tightening. The price is gentle, not acute, so tension remains low‑temperature. Still, agency clearly drives the turn and the end forecloses unrest.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (reopening the whispered chapel) is clear, and pressure coheres around the technical–empathetic task of alignment. The meaningful tightening is the decision to overlay the torn map and sync raindrops across decades, which reweights options and produces the portal insight. However, the on‑page price paid is subtle; there’s little risk or loss beyond emotional exposure. Tension is steady rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear but pressure is mostly internal; escalation comes through the intensifying motif work (untangling → playback → personal note → shatter). Agency is steady and reflective, with one meaningful deepening when the transmission plays and Mort reciprocates. The felt price is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than a narrowed option set, keeping the tension quiet. Effective for a lyric mode, if not gripping in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (give the ghost a voice/connection) is clear, and the lightning sequence provides a coherent tightening: first imprint → ghost’s plea → aligned rhythms → final encoding. Pressure remains gentle; the price paid is more lyrical than sharply felt, so escalation reads as intensification of pattern rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (retrieve and release stored joy) is legible, but pressure is low and largely unopposed. The path unfolds without a credible obstacle or trade‑off, and no option is foreclosed beyond gentle endurance. The tightening beat (unlocking the diary) functions more as permission than test. The ending resolves without a visible price or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal (memorializing, proving remembrance) and signaled early; escalation occurs via a density shift when the comet appears and the inscriptions accrue. The pressure is coherent but remains largely contemplative; few options are foreclosed beyond the vigil’s endurance. The final move (recording then leaving) is earned but not hard‑won. Emotional cost is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (finish the mural before demolition) is signaled early and coherently tightens via the hush/noon deadline. The meaningful turn is the final coin press into wet pigment just before the fall, narrowing options to one last act. Cost is explicit: the building collapses; risk is borne in the choice to keep painting. Stakes remain intimate but felt, with internal resolve braided to external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are legible (harness light without draining the ship), but escalation is largely smooth and unopposed. The tightening (halo appears, then intensifies as she completes the chalk line) lands, yet no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. Pressure is accumulative rather than contested, leaving a satisfying image but limited tension. The result is pretty, not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure rises via density and cadence: the glow, the mirrored chamber, the unlocking, the ripple into a temporal corridor. Stakes (repairing time/learning its rhythm) stay coherent but the opposition is gentle; risk and trade-off remain abstract. The key tightening is the unlocking/engagement that triggers the hall’s transformation. The price reads as ongoing duty and solitude more than acute loss.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (collective hope/resource sharing) are signaled but conflict is low-friction; there’s no true resistance to lifting or timing the bell. The only tightening is the nebula’s peak, a soft clock rather than a crucible. Resolution arises from communal assent rather than tested trade-off. The effect is lovely but lacks a visible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure accrues via density and cadence: approach → placement → turning → seam → whisper, culminating in the world’s pause. The stakes (a borrowed pause of time) concentrate into a single decisive intensification at the hush’s thickening and the lantern’s vow. Explicit opposition is minimal, so tension rides on pattern and timing rather than resistance; within the chosen lens, that escalation reads coherent. The cost is largely borne as responsibility and endurance rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (guide travelers before frost locks the nut) is clear and escalates via time pressure and the birds’ circling. The meaningful tightening is the approach to the stump under a ticking clock, culminating in placement. Cost is present but primarily conceptual and ongoing (the orchard remains cursed; role cycles). A sharper on‑page risk to the protagonist in the peak moment could have heightened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming separation into connection—tightens via the insight and on-page making of the bridge. Pressure is primarily internal, with limited jeopardy or friction during execution, so cost feels modest. The cadence shift from contemplation to communal impact provides the needed deepening. The final return with the chrysalis cements consequence rather than raising new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accrues via pattern intensification rather than opposition: measuring absence increases luminosity, incision releases energy, and the child’s uncapping completes the cadence. The dominant stake (find the place beginnings start) is signaled and satisfied, but prices and foreclosed options remain abstract. Escalation reads as density and chorus rather than narrowing choices. The ending is earned but soft on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transmute collective remorse) is signaled early, and pressure tightens when tasting spreads sorrow, risking amplification before release. The meaningful deepening is the shift from containment to catalyzed dissolution with the coral’s cracking. The cost is legible and environmental, though a more explicit threatened failure or time pressure could heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—healing the city by bridging silos—tightens via the chime transforming the grain elevators’ talk into chorus, prompting workers to act. However, resistance is negligible; escalation is a steady swell rather than a pressured narrowing. The decisive agency is clear but largely untested. The felt price is modest, mostly expended as effort and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (forge a bridge to the canyon’s memory) and tension increases via responsive canyon and tremor. The meaningful tightening is the tremor plus the risk of shattering the fragile bridge, prompting her recommitment. However, options never narrow into a hard trade‑off, and consequences remain mostly conceptual rather than felt on the page. Escalation is steady but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (secure forgotten combinations) is clear, and the ticking inversion hour provides a single tightening. But external resistance is minimal: the cipher yields without meaningful setback, and the hour never forces a risky trade‑off. Escalation reads as a rise in spectacle rather than cost, so tension plateaus after the cipher resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure mounts via density: each new crack forces fresh study and translation, culminating in the final “sigh” and the grove’s audible response. Stakes remain internal and artistic, with limited counterforce or risk other than failure to coax sound. The decisive intensification is the shift from silent intent to the grove’s shared hearing. Costs are felt but gentle, keeping escalation effective yet not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are signaled (“before the next phase,” repair the covenant), and the pressure coheres as density rather than direct confrontation. The key tightening is the tutor’s decision to speak the phrase and align pieces with stars, which deepens options rather than foreclosing them. Prices paid are conceptual (acceptance of sorrow, exile’s weight) rather than visibly narrowing choices. Escalation is graceful but gentle, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (unlock and “recover” the diary’s truth toward empathy) is clear, but escalation is gentle; alignment occurs without a meaningful setback or trade-off. The key tightening is the frequency alignment leading to the clasp opening, yet there’s little felt price or foreclosed option. Tension remains lyrical more than pressured. Resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes (will Lira cultivate serenity and earn the corpse flower’s bloom) remain largely abstract and unopposed, with escalation expressed as gentle accrual rather than tangible narrowing. The single tightening is the transition from sprout to bloom and the village gathering, but no option is foreclosed or traded. The “price” is patience and enduring a powerful scent. Pressure is coherent but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and the time window adds gentle pressure, but obstacles are minimal and discovery comes smoothly. The key tightening is the decision to release the tip, trading immediate utility for planetary stewardship. Emotional and tactical costs register but lightly. Tension is steady rather than climbing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—neutralize lingering storm energy—stays coherent, but pressure rarely tightens. The curve pointing to the tower is a meaningful deepening; after that, resistance is minimal and the release happens almost at a whisper. Options don’t visibly narrow, and no trade‑off or loss alters tactics. The result is lovely but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is gentle: the dominant stake (imprinting wonder) faces little opposition, so escalation is mostly intensity of image, not narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs as the cavern “answers,” but no trade‑off is forced. The cost of leaving or of singing is barely felt. Tension stays aesthetic rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure builds quietly from preparation to activation to crossing, with one meaningful tightening at the fissure. Stakes remain largely conceptual (harvesting failure insights), and costs are implied rather than felt in-scene. Agency drives every turn, but no option is decisively foreclosed beyond her acceptance of a new mission. The thunder’s final chord gives a satisfying, if gentle, pressure release.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is focused (discover the theorem of emotion), and escalation is a density increase: ambiguous line → infusion → echoing verses → bodily alignment → object rupture. The decisive tightening arrives with the halo cracking, which both rewards and prices the pursuit. Pressure is largely internal and aesthetic rather than antagonistic, keeping costs conceptual rather than concrete. One more constrained choice under pressure would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain gentle: inspiring wonder is a worthy aim but faces minimal resistance. The shepherd and girl scenes resolve without friction, and the “hidden chorus of spirits” signals intensification without testing him. The final turn into legend is resonant but not earned through escalated pressure. Costs or foreclosed options aren’t made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepens as perception shifts from visual to visceral to kinetic (engine). The escalation is mostly a steady intensification rather than a test with risk or reversal; no live option is sharply foreclosed beyond the comfort of prior assumptions. Agency drives each beat, but the absence of meaningful resistance or trade‑off limits pressure. The final vow registers cost conceptually, not through loss enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular and legible: get the message across at a personal cost. Escalation is gentle but coherent—each puzzle click knits sound back, culminating in the pedestal decision. The cost is more atmospheric than sharply dramatized, yet it reweights the final image. No antagonistic force, but coherent pressure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—gain the means to rebuild—arrives early and persists, with one meaningful tightening: the barter of memory to open the tunnel. However, there’s little friction after that; acquiring and applying the silk proceeds without real opposition. The cost is legible but not escalating under pressure, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and deepens with the discovery of the sealed log. However, escalation lacks resistance; each step succeeds without meaningful obstacle or tradeoff until the shard’s final shattering. The decision to stitch realities is a real tightening but reads low-pressure. Consequence lands, but pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (preserving a chain of hope/safety) is clear and the lamp’s failure offers a single tightening. Escalation is largely internal and atmospheric, with little forced trade-off or irreversible loss beyond the lamp dying. The pulse is a lovely intensification but risk remains abstract. The resolution arises from a chosen stance rather than tested sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—complete the ritual to redirect the storm and midwife a shadowed dawn—is clear and escalates once via the prophetic symbols prompting immediate action. Pressure remains more aesthetic than perilous; the reef/darkness never counters on the page, so cost is muted. Agency is present (steering, lifting, splitting the beam), but consequences feel largely conceptual. The tightening suffices at this length yet stops short of unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on knowledge and vocation: learning the magnetism rule and committing to its stewardship. Escalation is gentle—discover, read, follow, enact—more deepening than tightening with limited felt trade-off. The key turn is placing the wing on the loom, which reweights options but doesn’t visibly foreclose another path. Pressure remains coherent but largely unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: dismantle the sorrow‑grid without harm, translate witness into peace. Escalation is a gentle deepening (moon rising, mapping connecting yearnings), but resistance is minimal and near-frictionless; no option is foreclosed beyond time and attention. Agency is present in the steady, methodical unspooling, yet the felt cost remains soft. The cadence shift lands, but tension never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes (revive a night‑bound realm) are high but pressure is soft; escalation is a steady swell without reversal or narrowing trade‑offs. The spirits’ arrival amplifies scope rather than testing resolve. The vow adds a price, but it arrives after largely unopposed progress. Strong accumulation, limited contest.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to face and reframe a past mistake—tightens from attic hesitation to the blank-book mirror test. The decisive deepening is his spoken admission, which reconfigures access and meaning (the key to the deepest chamber). Pressure remains internal and cohesive under the accumulative lens, but the price reads more contemplative than constrictive. A touch more friction in the moment of admission would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes remain gentle and internal; the discovery of the loaf and decision to share it provide the sole meaningful tightening. Pressure does not intensify beyond a deepening of ritual significance, and no option is starkly foreclosed. The offering to the empty chair is a lovely turn but does not carry a visible price beyond solitude and the bread’s consumption. Escalation is coherent but subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: awaken the slide/secure meaning against oblivion. Escalation is a measured tightening—frequencies shifting, glow intensifying, a final settling that culminates in the pulse. The price is borne as an ethical/psychic weight rather than a material trade-off, which keeps tension refined more than fraught. Earned, if gentle, progression.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the truce—tightens when the lock cracks and the scout appears; the decisive trade‑off is the lantern toss that buys hush at the price of darkness and brief rule breach. Escalation is mostly linear and protagonist‑driven, with a single meaningful turn. The scout beat ends swiftly, limiting felt jeopardy and aftershock. Still, the cost carries into the charged closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on understanding a phenomenon; pressure coheres via convergence and the live “election” altering conditions, but the opposition is gentle and largely atmospheric. One meaningful deepening occurs when the forest’s decision shifts humidity and redirects the compass. Agency is mostly attentional and ritual rather than risked action, keeping costs subtle. The escalation reads as density increase rather than threat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (unlocking creativity) are legible early, and the mirror‑alignment beat is a meaningful tightening. The piece lacks real resistance; solutions appear with little contest, so cost feels light. Still, the internal and external conflicts braid enough to sustain tension, and the final stroke forecloses a before‑state. The escalation reads as density and cadence rather than reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (honesty as a force against a poisoned world) escalates coherently, but opposition is soft and solutions arrive with minimal resistance. The refusal of the council and the puzzle assembly are pressure points, yet neither extracts a concrete on‑page price during the climb. The final activation of the vent is earned but relatively frictionless. Tension functions more as wonder‑driven discovery than hard conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure accumulates via ritual and witnesses, but escalation is gentle; no meaningful option is foreclosed beyond ongoing silence and care. The key “tightening” is tonal rather than tactical, culminating in his promise. Stakes remain abstract (preserve wonder) with little test beyond weather’s cooperation. The final stance crystallizes without a clear visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early (prevent uncontrolled burn/contain chaos; resolve static). Escalation tightens once via the shift and sensor warning, and Vira’s tactic (miniaturization) narrows options before initiating the burn. The resolution is earned and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, though risk feels largely managed and the tangible price minimal. Tension hums more than bites.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—solving the mystery by listening and channeling it for community—remains gentle, with little counterforce. Escalation is primarily a deepening of pattern (sound → letters → exhibit → visitors → child) rather than narrowing options. The cost and pressure never quite bite, so tension stays low. The final beat is tender but not risked.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (transforming vulnerability/liberating the lab) is clear, but pressure rarely tightens against her; obstacles soften into ritual. The key turn (singing to the dice revealing the crystal) feels assured, with minimal resistance or trade‑off. The emotional price is implied rather than pressed. Tension is atmospheric more than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are singular—uncover the fate of discarded memories—and escalate through a pattern intensification rather than confrontation. The main tightening occurs when the spiral appears and the chamber responds, leading to the slab and release; agency drives each step. Cost remains soft (a weight in the lantern, quiet awe), so pressure feels meditative rather than urgent. A sharper trade‑off or foreclosed path would raise tension.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and the pressure coheres, but escalation is gentle: thrumming → glyphs → lattice → sealing. There’s one clear deepening (the wing emitting glyphs and forming a lattice), with the brook’s slowed flow as confirmation. Opposition or trade‑off is minimal, so cost remains soft. Agency drives resolution, but risk feels managed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is emotional/intellectual access and trust, but pressure remains low; the sugar problem is a charming detour, not a tightening. The key “turn” is Liora’s offer that converts an errand into a ritual—elegant but soft. No option is foreclosed with visible cost; risk stays conceptual (a pact of lies) rather than enacted. Escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through deepening twilight and the shell’s iterative verses, culminating in the dawn merge. Stakes remain primarily internal but are clear and escalate via density and time pressure. The visible price—the shell’s silence and relinquishing night’s teachings—lands, though conflict stays low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal—can she transform forgery from blade to balm and forgive the unfinished. Pressure coheres via the live clock of dripping water and the hidden script reveal; escalation is modest but present. The key’s melting forecloses a path (continued unlocking of the past) and tightens her vow. Still, opposition remains gentle; the price is more renunciatory than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding and releasing echoes before dawn stills questions) is signaled and carried. Escalation proceeds via progressive disclosure to a single intensification: entering the cavern, facing the lattice, and choosing to sing and join the shells. Agency resolves the problem; coincidence (hidden cavern) is prepared by the webs tightening. The price is emotional and vocational rather than perilous, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (salvage purity) is signaled early and tightens when the dream lattice coheres into a window and the tactic shifts to embedding a final cameo. Escalation remains gentle and conceptual; the price is implied endurance and surrender to a communal repair rather than a hard trade‑off. The amber pulse and her departure suggest momentum but not sharpened peril. Coherence holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (appreciate hidden effort) remains largely internal and aesthetic; pressure escalates via density rather than narrowed options. The primary tightening is the decision to ritualize (mend memory with the whisk) and the return the next night, but no trade‑off is truly tested. The whistle eliciting a response reads as confirmation, not a costly turn. Stakes stay gentle and unthreatened.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. corporate lie; locating the stillpoint) is clear, but pressure escalates minimally. The puzzle aligns, then the diamond resolves the weather; there’s no credible reversal or foreclosed option beyond patience. Agency drives the turn, yet the price is light and opposition absent. Tension remains steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are legible early (forge allegiance/new dawn) and escalate through patterned intensification. The storm functions as pressure, but resistance is largely atmospheric rather than oppositional, and options rarely narrow with visible cost. The climax—coils sparking, painting the clouds, and public allegiance—lands, yet feels achieved without sacrifice. Tension is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (bridge generations via sound) is clear, with one meaningful deepening as the child arrives, forcing the shift from private curation to public teaching. Pressure escalates texturally rather than causally, moving from solitary gathering to communal sharing. The price—surrendering solitary ownership for stewardship—is present but understated. No hard reversal, yet the cadence shift reads as a live narrowing of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (protect the Heart from weaponization) and pressure coheres through the tuning and descent. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than reversal; options narrow at the vault and again with the calibration choice. The cost is more ethical than perilous; no strong antagonistic force or tangible loss presses her beyond competence. Still, the calibration to “heal, not harm” forecloses a path with clear implications.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she earn patience through methodical attention) tightens toward the moon’s apex. The low hum and compass alignment provide the decisive intensification; the “crack of release” marks cost and shift. Pressure is coherent but remains mostly interior and gentle, limiting the felt risk. Still, the escalation reads purposeful and culminates in a stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and deepens via the empirical discovery chain. Pressure escalates once (the humidity/flicker pattern pointing to hidden infrastructure), but resistance is low and solutions arrive without credible friction or trade-off. The final act is protagonist-driven, yet the absence of a tangible price or narrowing option set keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to intervene and “restart” a symbolic heart—is clear and tightens modestly through the decision to replace/adjust and the precise act of insertion. Escalation is more devotional than tense; obstacles remain minor and internal. The light-triggered beat provides a soft intensification rather than a hard trade‑off. Costs remain conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—ring the unheard bell—is clear but doesn’t bite; escalation mostly reads as aesthetic intensification rather than narrowing options. Transliteration and approach work on the first try with limited resistance; the acid sea’s threat stays atmospheric. There’s no substantive trade‑off or loss to sharpen the peak. The post‑ring shift toward the “next mystery” deepens scope but doesn’t increase cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (resurrecting the lost crew/logs; decoding deletion) and tighten once through the deliberate lie and discovery of the checksum. However, obstacles fall quickly after each attempt, with limited visible sacrifice or foreclosed options on the page. The ethical risk to her position or the network’s pushback is implied rather than dramatized. Tension functions but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—restore the shard/beam to guide the lost—is clear, and pressure coheres as she commits to the mirror method. Escalation is a gentle deepening (reflections/advice to alignment) rather than a true narrowing under risk. Little is foreclosed and opposition is absent; the price paid is mainly attention and resolve. The steadying of the beam reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to move toward death or inhabit endings with acceptance—tightens through the volunteers’ collective gesture and the wind’s crescendo. The on‑page cost is a quiet renunciation, not a forced trade‑off, but it reads. Escalation is rhythmic rather than event‑driven, consistent with the chosen lens. A slightly clearer pressure point before the final realization could have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether he can transmute a mismatched love into living terroir; pressure coheres but stays low‑temperature. A meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to plant the scrap and later to let it dissolve, foreclosing possession. The cost is felt but understated, with no external antagonism. Tension is steady rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual (preserving wisdom’s echo), with minimal counterforce or risk; pressure deepens once at the prophet’s arrival but never tightens into a trade‑off. The conjuring is smooth and uncontested, and the villagers’ inquiry resolves without friction. The final choice to depart is earned but not costly on the page. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (can the ritual mend communal pain?), but pressure escalates gently rather than through a narrowing of options. The main tightening is the villagers’ arrival and the feather reveal; no credible alternative or loss forces a trade‑off. Emotional cost surfaces in tears and exposure to memory, though consequences remain largely positive. The result is affecting but low in contest and price.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (decoding growth’s pattern) is established early and deepens when light resolves into memory. Pressure accrues texturally; there’s no adversarial force, but the realization reweights options and prompts the offering. Costs remain mostly conceptual/emotional, with limited narrowing of choices on the page. The single tightening beat suffices but is not strenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve a vanishing self/echo—tightens as he enters the center, touches chalk to fog, hears the aging hum, and chooses to record and later inscribe. Escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. The visible price is an acceptance that he cannot trap time, only trace it. Pressure is coherent but remains elegiac, not acute, which keeps the heat just below peak.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is coherent: convert relentless spin into usable purpose. Escalation arrives via the precise alignment beat timed to the leaf’s sound; the chime signals the narrowing of options. The reversal—hand slowing by routing excess to the telescope—feels earned by his restructuring. Stakes skew conceptual and could read abstract, but the pressure tightens convincingly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (a flawless goodbye) is clear and the pressure coheres through the ritual’s build and the approach of death. Escalation is a density increase (cadence tightening) rather than a turn, culminating in the last breath and keepsake division. Cost is present (letting go) but the path is unresisted, with no meaningful trade‑off or reversal testing Mara’s commitment. The tension remains gentle, not sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is conceptual discovery, and escalation is gentle: ritual intensifies to doorway, then chamber. Opposition is minimal and mostly procedural; no strong trade‑off or live option foreclosed on the page. The tightening exists but the felt price is muted. The key beats still cumulate to a clear turn.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (mend the substitute body / narrow the “cleft in certainty”) is clear but faces little resistance. The tightening is a gentle cadence change—aligning bones to the final click—rather than a foreclosing trade‑off. Consequences are largely asserted as possibility rather than tested under pressure. The ending’s choice to keep the tooth hints at cost but doesn’t force a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are singular and coherent (can she make light without fire?), with a measured tightening as she polishes, arranges, chants, and finally completes the spiral. The decisive act of placing the final shard functions as the turn. Still, pressure remains low; the felt price and narrowing of options are more implied than contested. The piece sustains tension through cadence rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure builds through density rather than opposition: following the drip pattern, choosing to seed stones, then sacrificing the pendant to wake code. Stakes remain intimate and coherent; the decisive intensification is interface activation and memory rewriting. The felt price remains gentle, limiting bite in the peak beat. Still, agency drives the turn and resolves the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stake is singular: honorably binding fleeting hopes against a resisting narrative current. Pressure coheres and modestly escalates (denser mist, louder closing pages, current trying to pull words away). The price is implied endurance and ethical risk, but on‑page consequence remains light—no option is explicitly foreclosed beyond fatigue and continued vow. Resolution derives from her agency but lacks a sharp trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake (restore rites) and tightens as the moon rises and the melody is calibrated, culminating in the pollen cascade and vow. Escalation is primarily rhythmic and imagistic rather than adversarial; there’s no counterforce beyond timing. The cost reads as ongoing duty rather than a tradeoff on the page. Earned, if gentle, deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (will she successfully seal and commit to its upkeep) is present and coherently deepens through the ritual to the vow. Escalation is subtle under the accumulative lens: the flare and cascade of light intensify the commitment rather than narrow options sharply. The cost—ongoing tending—lands, but there’s little on-page resistance or loss beyond endurance. One decisive tightening rather than a turn keeps this just under the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes cohere around restoring rhythm to capture echoes; escalation is a density increase rather than a fight—studies, substitution, the hum, then the library reframing. The primary tightening is the leap from missing tooth to resonant crystal, which narrows options meaningfully. Pressure remains gentle; no hard trade-off is paid beyond time and a conceptual reckoning. Still, the cadence shift and resulting conduit feel earned by Corin’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible and the pressure coheres, but escalation remains gentle and mostly ritualistic. The “final alignment” and the air compressing into a crystal are the key tightening beats. Visible price is limited to patience/stillness; there’s no reversal or hard trade-off. Resolution derives from her agency but faces little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stake: transform grief into a usable form. Pressure tightens through the on‑page making: discovering sap, choosing to press glass, and creating the lantern, with a cadence shift as she leaves. The cost is acceptance over spectacle—“loss can be a tool”—and foreclosing the roar’s performative past. Escalation is quiet but clear for the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: secure a restorative memory via negotiation. Pressure tightens through the accumulative ritual—each story shard adding weight to the ghost, culminating in the trade via the spinning wheel—so the pact cannot be hand‑waved. The cost is legible (she surrenders regrets into stewardship and accepts ongoing duty). Escalation is more tonal than oppositional, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (revival) is signaled early, and escalation occurs via system reactivation, but pressure remains gentle; success arrives without a visible price or serious narrowing of options. The schematic “maze” hints at ethical stakes yet doesn’t force a trade‑off on the page. The beacon activation is a satisfying beat but not contested. Tension is more contemplative cadence shift than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (making peace with the abandoned dream) is signaled early; the meaningful tightening is his decision to inscribe the crystal and claim the project. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, consistent with the accumulative lens. The cost—renouncing guild strictures and embracing sentiment—is felt but soft, with limited on‑page resistance. Still, the single chime acts as a credible culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is signaled (unlocking mechanisms of city and myth), and the frozen lock provides the lone concrete obstacle. Escalation peaks at the mechanical solution; thereafter tension diffuses into reflection without added cost or narrowed options. The price of his stance remains abstract, so the final resolve feels low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes remain intimate—preserving methods through attentional endurance—and the main tightening is the fulgurite activating and the vow to keep vigil. Pressure builds texturally rather than via reversal, consistent with the lens, but there’s limited sense of risk or foreclosed alternatives. The “weight of centuries” lands as cost, yet it’s gentle and mostly conceptual. Still, the choice to become a daily custodian marks an earned trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual (honor absences, enable healing), and pressure is gentle; opposition is atmospheric rather than active. The primary tightening is the shift from witnessing to effecting (reviving the rose) leading to renewed commitment. There’s little felt price or foreclosed path beyond continued solitude, so escalation never quite bites. The turn is graceful but low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restore beauty in a mechanized world—is coherent and tightens once with the assembly/placement choice. Escalation is gentle; there’s little jeopardy or trade‑off beyond commitment and belief. The hatch functions as a clean intensification but avoids visible loss. Resolution is driven by his agency, though pressure never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on whether compassion can transform a destructive inheritance, but pressure is gentle and unopposed. The meaningful tightening is the graft itself and the coin’s response, yet there’s no credible risk of failure or visible price. Villagers arrive to bless rather than test her stance. The escalation reads as a steady deepening of mood rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—free the memories—tightens through the symbol‑trail and the hinge “sticking,” culminating in the careful unstick. Escalation is present but soft; failure consequences remain abstract, and the resistance never credibly threatens to stop her. Agency drives the turn, but the felt price is modest. The cadence shift at the opening beat works, if without a hard foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (light without fire), and escalation occurs as sonar reveals war‑shadows, testing her vow. The tightening is a commitment choice—she continues despite troubling revelations. The cost is felt but largely conceptual; no option is foreclosed beyond the renunciation already stated. Tension stays coherent but never bites deeply enough to feel perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent—can Eliam translate collective grief into form—but pressure escalates gently through accumulation (migration phases, growing spiral) rather than friction. The decisive tightening arrives with the final wave and heart-shaped ribbon prompting the monument’s design. Costs are implied rather than dramatized. The resolution is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (restoring balance) is coherent and signaled early; the meaningful tightening is acting precisely in the pendulum’s pause. Escalation is mostly a deepening of ritual rather than a narrowing of options; cost remains abstract. The resumption of swing is earned by agency, but tension never bites hard. Still, the cadence shift at the hum → tremble → resume is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal and consistent but pressure is soft; the work unfolds without friction or meaningful risk. The key deepening is the revelation of Marlowe’s map and the circle insight, which reweights meaning rather than tightening options. No adversarial force tests commitment beyond attention and care. The result feels serene rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (avert famine) is clear, but pressure tightens only modestly; skepticism and weather threat are mostly narrated past. The modeling turn is the single deepening beat; after that, execution succeeds without on‑page setbacks or trade‑offs. Costs and foreclosed options are underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reviving a silenced city) is signaled early; escalation comes through the signal’s arrival, the crowd’s gathering, and the precise alignment to catch the chorus. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara chooses to amplify and publicly play the pirate broadcast. Prices are soft (exposure, holding a secret for future nights), so pressure reads more ceremonial than risky. The cadence shift lands, but with limited felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and clear (capture a fleeting emotion before it dissolves); pressure escalates via density and cadence: hush, incantation, chair’s stop, light, crystallization. The decisive narrowing is her choice to align mask with powder and then to dissolve the powder, accepting loss for truth. Opposition is largely ambient rather than active, but the textural build suits the chosen lens. Cost is felt in the chill and in relinquishing the “mirage of safety.”

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—choosing a narrative that will shape civic memory—is clear and tightens with the cog’s “sync,” culminating in the decision to preserve both. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals; the decisive turn is internal but coherent. The price (foreclosing the pursuit of a single truth) is implied more than viscerally felt. Still, the agency at the end is unmistakable (ciphering, documentation).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (reviving vanishing arts/unlearning hatred) are signaled and the pressure coheres through music drawing participation. Escalation is a gentle deepening rather than a sharp turn: first chord → crowd softening → child/veteran join. The price is conceptual (commitment to a long process) rather than on‑page sacrifice. A credible tightening exists but remains low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—coaxing the knowledge seed to sprout during the alignment—is clear and escalates with the sky’s “zenith” and the seed’s burst. The tightening reads as a cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options; risk and consequence remain low. The pruning metaphor provides a thematic trade‑off, but few on‑page obstacles test commitment. Resolution feels earned but lightly taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around restoring the tower’s wonder; turning the key is the meaningful tightening that deepens options. Escalation is mostly discovery rather than conflict; coincidence (drone emergence) reads as a consequence but the price paid is low. Agency drives revival but not a hard trade-off. Stakes are clear yet soft.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are internal and coherent, but pressure remains low; escalation appears as a widening field of hush rather than narrowing options. The key tightening—placing the shard and witnessing its spread—deepens meaning without forcing a trade‑off. No major reversal or cost that forecloses a path. The resolution is fitting yet comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reconfiguring ossified certainty—stays abstract, with limited pressure or trade‑off shown on the page. The main tightening is the choice to route memory through a known weakness and later knit it with light, but escalation remains gentle. Costs and foreclosed options are implied rather than dramatized. Resolution reads earned within the lyric frame but never truly tests the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (transcending confinement via a logic-driven machine) is signaled early and deepens as the staircase “quivers” and reconfigures. Escalation is more density/response than dilemma; there’s little forced trade-off on the page. The cost is primarily conceptual—accepting imperfection—rather than a tangible loss. Still, the tightening from repeated rolls to the rupture and final landing reads as a legitimate intensification in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible (will her work rouse strangers) and tightens once: the sunrise threatens the spell, then Jiro arrives to test it. The pressure is gentle—no hard trade‑off, and the price (fatigue, anonymity) stays mostly tonal. Still, the Jiro beat deepens the stake rather than resetting it. A slightly clearer felt cost at peak would raise urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible (reviving arts vs. cultural extinction), and pressure builds via symbolic acts culminating in the amphitheater’s opening. Escalation is gentle and primarily tonal; there’s little on‑page resistance or trade‑off testing Liora’s commitment. The cost is largely conceptual rather than felt through a hard choice. Still, one meaningful tightening occurs under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (initiate the engine) is legible and achieved, but escalation is mostly linear and unopposed. The meaningful tightening—realizing the stone is a conduit that activates the gears—arrives, yet no option is foreclosed with a visible price. External resistance (sea, rust, age) never materially tests his plan. As a result, tension and cost remain modest at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unbosom fear—tightens via concrete moves (placing the clasp, paradox flare, speaking “vanish”). The escalation is coherent: each attempt intensifies pressure and narrows options to a command that forces a reveal. The cost is primarily conceptual (future burden) rather than immediate harm; the emotional trade-off could be sharper. Still, agency drives the peak turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and benevolent—prove harmony by transmuting obstacles—so pressure never tightens into a consequential trade‑off. The amber shift prompts a deeper dub, but no option is foreclosed and no visible loss occurs. The finale’s dissolve is beautiful but low in cost. Escalation reads as intensity modulation rather than a narrowing path.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (avoid fossilization by contacting watchers) is legible and tightens once through the mosaic/hidden passage. Escalation is primarily deepening of pattern density rather than hard external resistance; the “price” remains abstract. Mira’s agency drives each turn, but no live option feels meaningfully foreclosed beyond a worldview shift. Tension reads steady, not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (rescuing truth from noble lies) is signaled early, but pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten. Obstacles (rust, decay) are symbolic rather than constraining; the letter cooperates, and the environment yields. The decisive turn (glow intensifies, ivy recedes) occurs without a forcing cost or narrowed options. Resolution is protagonist-driven yet lightly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds texturally: crossing into cold water, planting notes, ink bleeding, culminating in a personal vow. The dominant stake (preserving memory) tightens once but lacks a clear on‑page price or foreclosed option. Absence of a concrete antagonist or reversal keeps tension quiet yet coherent. The cadence shift at the vow lands, just shy of unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—preserving knowledge and validating origins—are clear, but pressure escalates gently rather than decisively; obstacles yield without resistance. The hypothesis and cipher deepen options, yet there’s little felt cost or foreclosed path during the descent or vault scene. The council’s agreement arrives without friction, reducing tension at a potential pressure point. The ending is earned but the journey lacks a palpable squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief) is clear and coherently escalates through the ritual’s phases, with the noon shadow as a live clock. Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens rather than reverses; the decisive tightening occurs as the basilica hums and lifts, reweighting cost and hope. There’s no explicit antagonism or blocked attempt, but the piece earns its turn via density and cadence shift. The felt price—beauty that burns with loss—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are dominantly internal—will he risk merging with the pool—and escalate through a clear tightening: discovery → amplification → commitment. The decisive act (palm toward fissure) is protagonist‑driven. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, which mutes intensity slightly. Still, pressure remains coherent to the closing reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“decode the frequency of belonging”) and encounter little resistance; the mechanisms awaken without obstacle. The single tightening beat is the lever pull, which swiftly succeeds. Pressure does not force a tradeoff or foreclose a live option; consequence is mostly aspirational. Tension operates more as wonder than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes center on uncovering a withheld truth to relieve guilt, with escalation via the search, alignment, and the humming activation. The key tightening arrives when carvings resolve into a phrase and the watch hand triggers the hum; it’s clear but not grueling. Cost is internal and somewhat cushioned by a swift path to redemption. The pressure remains coherent but rarely corners the narrator into a painful trade‑off beyond admission.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—a risky exchange that must overcome past failure—reads early and holds. Escalation is modest: apology and offering tighten into agreement, with the rope drop signaling commitment. Opposition is soft; the counterpart’s assent comes without a real test, muting jeopardy. Emotional cost is present but not sharply priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (will he recommit to forward motion despite regret) is clear, but escalation is gentle; pressure deepens more by cadence than narrowing options. The kayak launch proceeds without a complicating hitch, so commitment is not materially tested. The compass settling provides a small internal tightening. A concrete trade‑off or minor loss would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (kindling empathy/redemption) is present, and pressure coheres through successive discoveries toward the choice to surrender the baseball. Escalation is gentle; the mirror’s admonition is a soft turn rather than a hard test. The cost (letting go of a comforting relic) is clear if modest. One meaningful tightening is present; no antagonistic pressure limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconnection beyond death) is clear early and tightens at the hand‑to‑antler touch. The escalation is primarily internal; the decisive acceptance of a bodily cost provides a single meaningful deepening. Stakes stay intimate rather than perilous, which keeps tension lower but coherent. A sharper hesitation or near‑refusal beat could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (soothing the twins via reclaiming time) is clear, and escalation occurs via density: opening the lid, widening crack, ascending cloud stair, and the final anointing. Agency drives each step, with the internal renunciation as the price. Still, pressure remains gentle; there’s no significant reversal or foreclosed option beyond the internal bind. The cost is felt but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (unlock a realm of healing through compassion) are clear and escalate via density and cadence rather than reversals: intention aligns, shimmer intensifies, seam trembles, vow catalyzes the crack. Agency drives resolution—no force, only stitching and the vow—but opposition is largely atmospheric (sorrow pressure) and rarely bites back. The cost is felt but gentle; options don’t narrow sharply beyond the ritual working. Still, the single meaningful tightening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on Mara’s renewal/understanding; pressure accumulates via the jar’s trembling release, the volcano’s pulse, and the fisherman’s prophecy. The tightening is more cadence shift than hard trade‑off, but the choice to release and reframe her path is earned. Costs are modest and internal rather than externally coerced. Still, the beat structure convincingly deepens rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (ignite a quiet revolt), but escalation is gentle; no credible resistance or narrowing of options tests commitment. The tightening occurs mostly through decoding logistics rather than moral or physical risk. The cradle activates without a setback, and consequences arrive smoothly. This limits tension and the felt price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can she harness the dust to reweight fate—arrives early and coheres. Escalation is a density increase (stones → spiral knots → ignition) rather than sharp reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The tightening turn is the placement of the final red stone that triggers the hum and flame. However, the price paid remains mostly obligation, with minimal on‑page resistance or risk to narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—releasing suppressed truth into a receptive world—tightens via the 23‑minute countdown and the storm’s volatile backdrop. Escalation is mostly cadence and density rather than narrowed options; the ring and “falling open” of the envelope provide the single meaningful intensification. Costs and trade‑offs are understated; no option foreclosed beyond the chosen ritual. Tension holds but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure escalates through the duel’s rhythm toward the philosopher’s final alignment move. Stakes are primarily conceptual (victory reframed as shared insight) and therefore read as elegant but soft. The final turn is agentive and earned by the established method (coded angles), though the on‑page price is low. A single decisive tightening lands; no deeper trade‑off is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on building beauty from anarchy, but pressure rarely tightens; opposition is ambient rather than embodied. The “guard’s tin” promises danger yet yields no on‑page risk, and the plan proceeds without a true test. Escalation is a density increase, not a narrowing of options. The result is moving but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—wresting a moment from fate—is signaled early and tightens as night approaches. Escalation tracks through the night‑gate, the arbor constriction, the compasses’ dimming, and the decisive step/encore. The price is legible (loss/repricing of time via the clock; surrender of guidance as compasses become stars), though pressure is largely internal. The earned turn comes at nightfall with the doorway and performance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres around time (pre‑monsoon) and process (translation under doubt). Tightening occurs as her luminous doubt crystallizes into resolve, culminating in the incantation; the sprout is a meaningful turn. The cost is prospective—the storm may still test and perhaps drown the shoots—charging the final pose. A sharper on‑page obstacle could have intensified the squeeze, but the scale fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—releasing the island’s sorrow—is signaled early and deepens via the ritual’s steps as the compass responds. Escalation is a steady density increase rather than a sharp turn; the needle’s quiver to cerulean and the second knot provide the key tightening. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; little is foreclosed beyond carrying regret forward. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives the outcome.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict is a compelling internal struggle between grand, dramatic science and a quiet, humble empiricism. The stake—Mara's scientific worldview—is clear. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively as observations mount over weeks, forcing her stance to crystallize. The cost is legible in her final relief and "confession of humility," showing a clear path has been foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—Elya's spiritual and professional survival—and deepens it effectively. The pressure is quiet but coherent, escalating from loss to a challenge of navigation and discovery. The discovery of the luminous glass shards is a well-executed deepening, changing her options and raising the stakes from mere rebuilding to transcendent creation, with the cost of her past work felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—rectifying the "heavy tide" of traumatic silence. The pressure deepens decisively when Mara activates the device, a point of no return that forces a confrontation with her memories. The cost of vulnerability is clear, and the resolution is earned through this act of agency, transforming her stasis into a new kind of strength.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—giving rest to the dead—is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively under the Accumulative/Textural lens, intensifying through the physical struggle against the environment rather than through plot twists. The final choice to place the last shard in an "impossibly thin slice of air" represents a meaningful peak of effort, and the cost is felt in Marlow's final, ambiguous dissolution into his work, which lands with poetic force.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.8)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. While stakes are declared (starvation vs. border patrols), the antagonistic pressure is never dramatized on the page. The plan is implemented without complication or setback, resulting in a static conflict where the community's success feels assured rather than earned against tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—releasing unused love—and escalates pressure effectively through an internal, metaphysical conflict. The tightening is well-handled: Milo must not just find the reservoir but actively transform its contents. The resolution is earned entirely through his agency (the focused breathing and exhale), and the consequences are made visible in the transformed environment, satisfying the stakes with a clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the conflict builds effectively. The dominant stake—feeling the texture of time—is tested and resolved in the climax. The arrival of the child provides the necessary catalyst, deepening the stakes and triggering the final transformation of the maze. The cost is explicit and thematically resonant: the photographs (fixed memories) must disintegrate for Mara to achieve her goal, making the resolution feel earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes—staving off mass famine—are exceptionally high, but the on-page conflict lacks commensurate pressure and escalation. Mara proceeds through a linear sequence of tasks with a competence that is never seriously challenged, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned against genuine opposition. The legendary "guardians" are mentioned but never manifest, deflating a key source of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—capturing the sound of broken trust—is compelling and consistently pursued. The conflict escalates texturally, deepening as Mara collects more absences and the device becomes more complete. The final chord provides a resolution with a legible emotional cost, fitting the accumulative structure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent. The chief conductor, the primary point of interaction, acts as a guide rather than an obstacle, providing Lira with the keys to her success without any resistance. The stakes, while conceptually grand, are never tested by genuine opposition, resulting in a narrative with progression but no escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—finding a meaningful way to contribute amidst global collapse—is entirely internal. The story successfully deepens this stake by juxtaposing the grand scale of the melt with Mara's minute, patient actions. The "tightening" occurs when she abandons the illusion of control, a choice that redefines her approach and carries the felt cost of accepting a slower, more fragile path to safety. The lack of a more acute on-page test or external pressure keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant internal stake—Mara's fear versus her need for authenticity—is clearly established and tested. The conflict escalates effectively when the vial requires a specific, emotional price ("the betrayal of the self I had hidden"), shifting the challenge from a puzzle to a personal sacrifice. This is a meaningful deepening that forces a climactic choice. Mara's agency in stepping onto the lever and accepting the transformation provides a clear, earned resolution with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—charting a void that refuses containment—is compelling and established early. The story achieves a sufficient deepening of pressure for its length, culminating in the singular moment when the mapping becomes possible. The oracle's agency is clear, and the resolution carries a palpable conceptual cost, fulfilling the requirements for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a compelling internal stake—the search for the origin of thought—and escalates it through a single, decisive action. The robot's agency in devising and executing the experiment provides a meaningful tightening. The cost is made beautifully legible through the melting violin and the profound, permanent shift in the robot's perception of its duties.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—overcoming the town's mistrust—is clear, and the narrative deepens as Mara moves from the tickets to the theater. However, the conflict lacks significant pressure or opposition, resolving through a magical, unopposed action. The resolution feels preordained and is achieved without a visible sacrifice or trade-off, which diminishes the tension and the weight of the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—mending the broken pact between gardener and garden—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict escalates texturally, with each polished marble increasing the garden's response, which serves as a meaningful deepening of pressure. The resolution provides a clear alteration in the relationship, and the cost (the acceptance of duality) is legible in the final beats, making the earned victory feel substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story builds tension effectively around a single, high-concept stake, focusing all pressure on Lira's decisive action with the lever. While the conflict is intellectual, Lira's agency is central, and the strange, atmospheric consequences serve as an earned and fitting cost that redefines the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing the ghost's melody—is clearly established. However, the conflict lacks meaningful escalation; Mara faces a puzzle, not an opposition, and solves it with relative ease. The absence of any significant setback, trade-off, or lasting personal cost for her success keeps the tension from truly intensifying, making the resolution feel more like a magical event than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—finding the weight of a truth—is established early and pursued with focus. Under an accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively as Mirela moves from observation to physical interaction with the data (smudging) and the instruments (adjusting the barometer). The resolution is earned, with a legible cost being the acceptance of the truth's weight, which reconfigures her future actions.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central conflict, while internal and conceptual, is clearly defined and escalates effectively under the accumulative lens. The pressure deepens from environmental awareness to a focused analysis that culminates in a decisive internal shift. The protagonist's agency drives this intensification, and the cost—internalizing the confession's weight—is made unmistakably clear in the line, "Mara felt its pressure settle into his own ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—psychological renewal—is clear and effectively deepened through the journey. Escalation works well under the Accumulative lens, with the increasing density of silence and physical narrowing of the tunnels creating coherent pressure. The resolution in the obsidian refuge feels earned, and the cost of temporary self-dissolution is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is gentle but coherent within the chosen lens. The dominant stake—whether Liora can forge a connection between the listeners and the earth—is signaled early and intensifies at the moment of eclipse. Liora's agency is clear as she initiates and guides the experience, and the positive resolution is earned by her actions. The lack of significant opposition or a more tangible cost keeps the tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The metaphysical stake—understanding the displaced axis—is signaled early and escalates with beautiful precision. The pressure deepens as the historian moves from interpreting texts to physically interacting with the silo's resonance, a meaningful turn that raises the stakes from intellectual curiosity to ontological discovery. The resolution is earned entirely through his agency, and the final image lands with the felt cost of profound, world-altering knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the writer can transform his art into a vehicle for liberation—is established and pursued consistently. The tightening occurs when he moves from accidental prophet to deliberate orchestrator, a choice with the clear cost of unleashing uncontrollable secrets. While the pressure is primarily internal and atmospheric, it effectively escalates the conceptual stakes toward the irreversible climax.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—averting "possession" by either shattering or sealing the veil—is established early and tested directly. The conflict deepens effectively under the accumulative lens as the ritual's intensity grows and the anchor's pull increases. The priest's agency in the final beat, directing the echo "like a spear," provides a decisive and earned resolution with a clear cost (the risk to his soul).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant internal stake—transforming longing into art—is clear and pursued with protagonist agency. The escalation, an intensification of focus culminating in the "Conduct" command, fits the accumulative lens perfectly. The story is kept from a higher score because the opposition feels abstract and the risk of failure ("Before exhaustion hits") is stated but not dramatized, making the victory feel more inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—conquering an internal labyrinth—is signaled early but never feels tangible. The pressure is conceptual, and the primary "escalation" is a moment of realization rather than a tightening of options or a choice with a clear, painful trade-off. Because the "cost" of accepting his fractured selves is framed as the key to victory, the central conflict lacks genuine friction or a sense of potential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—overcoming emotional numbness—is signaled early and pursued with clear agency. The conflict escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens, moving from coaxing silence to confronting it head-on. The decision to play the songs forward marks a decisive tightening, forcing a trade-off that has a visible cost: the dissolution of her protective apathy, which is earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—delivering truth across the quarantine—is established clearly. The pressure builds atmospherically, and the tightening occurs when Elara's lateral thinking uncovers a new path, foreclosing the option of inaction. The cost is felt in her continued isolation and the uncertainty of her message's fate, which appropriately charges the quiet ending. The escalation is internal and subtle, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant internal stake—understanding scent-induced sorrow—is established early and tested directly. The pressure deepens decisively when the vial is uncorked, transforming the abstract question into an overwhelming sensory experience. The cost is made palpable as Arlen grieves for collective, not just personal, history, and his final choice to "catalog every aroma" represents a meaningful and earned renunciation of his old, simpler goal.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—discovering the texture of time—is maintained, and the narrative deepens toward the final choice. However, the pressure feels low because the "impossible choices" are presented as philosophical hypotheticals rather than conflicts with dramatized, immediate consequences. While the final choice has a stated cost, the preceding dilemmas lack the visceral tension needed to make the escalation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is a compelling thematic struggle against despair and silence, with the stake being the possibility of creating beauty from ruin. The pressure deepens texturally rather than escalating causally, which is appropriate for the chosen lens. The final choice to play feels earned, and the cost—embracing the world's unfinished state—is legible in the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—successfully creating the counterfeit emotion—is clear and pursued with focus. The conflict is primarily a procedural one, with pressure building effectively through the accumulative sensory details of the process. The resolution is earned, and the conceptual cost (her detachment) is legible, but the story lacks a sharp, unexpected reversal or trade-off that would have elevated the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict or stakes. Mara's path is frictionless; she faces no opposition, no difficult trade-offs, and no risk of failure. The central desire to return the locket is never seriously challenged. The narrative unfolds as a pleasant sequence of events rather than an escalation of pressure, and the resolution, while emotionally resonant, is not earned by overcoming any tangible obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake: Arlen's need to "graft herself onto community." The conflict is a subtle, collective one against the "luminescent ache" of isolation. Pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens, culminating in a choice that redefines the community's task from a finite search to an infinite process of creation. The cost is the acceptance that kinship is a fragile, ongoing duty, which is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story establishes a clear, if abstract, stake and escalates pressure through an intensification of magical phenomena, fitting its textural lens. The core weakness is the lack of a tangible trade-off or price at the climax. Because Mira achieves her goal completely and the "cost" is not viscerally felt, the conflict's resolution lacks the final turn of the screw that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reframing ambiguous loss—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates texturally, culminating in the moment the vibrations translate loss into numbers, which serves as a meaningful deepening of knowledge. However, the conflict is almost entirely frictionless. The resolution is achieved without facing any significant opposition, setback, or trade-off, making the final "pulse of hope" feel less earned than it could be. The cost remains too abstract to create high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story effectively builds pressure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The dominant stake—becoming visible by channeling memory—is clear, and the conflict against obscurity intensifies through sensory details like the reel's faint pulse and the echoing resonance. The flickering lights of the outage provide a consistent source of urgency, and the final choice to step forward is earned with a legible conceptual cost: taking on the city's collective grief.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of meaningful stakes or escalating pressure. The conflict—a leaf's reluctance to turn green—is entirely observational and passive, creating almost no tension. The resolution arrives without the character having to overcome significant opposition or make a difficult trade-off, flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a potent dominant stake: Mara's intensely personal art versus the island's communal renewal. The offer of the exchange provides a single, effective tightening that forces a costly choice. The resolution is earned through her agency, and the price—the loss of her canvases—is clear and felt. The conflict is primarily thematic and internal, which is handled well under the story's accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake is clear and there is a meaningful deepening of Lira's understanding that serves as the story's key turn. However, the conflict lacks palpable pressure; tension is declared ("the air thickens with anticipation") rather than dramatized through opposing forces or a credible risk of failure. The gentle, inevitable unfolding of events prevents the stakes from feeling truly high.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is clear, and the story deepens it by expanding from a solitary to a communal effort, and finally to a legendary quest. However, the on-page pressure is minimal. The archivist faces no significant opposition or risk of failure; the fishermen readily provide fragments, and the final call is answered without hesitation. The conflict remains an abstract contest against absence rather than a tangible, pressing struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear stake—finding the fortress—and escalates pressure through a series of thresholds. While not a traditional conflict with an antagonist, the progression of locks and mysteries provides a coherent tightening of focus. The final choice to accept the role of conduit is driven by the protagonist's agency, and the cost—a commitment to an endless, extraordinary task—is made legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s internal struggle between skepticism and wonder—is clear and deepens with each revelation from the tile. The escalation is textural, not causal, and culminates in a decisive internal resolution. The cost is the forfeiture of pure logic, which is made legible in her final feeling of "rare peace," a trade-off that feels both earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—overcoming existential ennui—is established immediately and escalates effectively through a deepening of mystery rather than external opposition. The "spatial mutiny" provides a meaningful pressure point that forces the immortal to choose between stasis and engagement. The resolution is driven by his agency in seeking an answer, and the cost—the dissolution of his former self—is made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—political asylum—and escalates pressure through the accumulative weight of the room’s sorrow. The single, decisive deepening occurs when the "dense fog" allows the ink to activate, a turn enabled by the protagonist's specific agency ("waiting actively"). The resolution is earned within the story's logic, and the cost is felt in the transformation of her personal legacy and internal doubts.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a coherent, if subtle, stake: creating meaning and connection in the face of profound silence. The conflict deepens effectively, shifting the protagonist's motivation from personal collection to a future-oriented act of bridge-building for the silent town. This single, decisive deepening provides sufficient escalation for the story's length and textural mode, with the cost of solitude felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—a quest for meaning in an erased existence—is established early and deepens effectively. The discovery of the poison label provides a significant tightening, shifting the protagonist from passive collector to active interpreter. The climax, driven by the high tide, feels earned and resolves the existential conflict by transforming the protagonist's core vulnerability into a unique strength, paying off the stake with a resonant conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—decoding the riddle of myth's endurance—is epistemic but effectively dramatized through Selene's interaction with the observatory's artifacts. The pressure deepens as the cello's hum rises and the ledger is discovered, forcing a re-evaluation of her quest. The cost is clear: she must abandon her "myth-busting" search for a single origin point in favor of a more fluid, artistic understanding of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing privatization—is signaled clearly, but the escalation of conflict is summarized rather than shown. The process of community reorganization, the story's central struggle, happens off-page, so the pressure never feels immediate or visceral. The resolution is achieved too easily, with the investors seemingly defeated by a mural, and the protagonist pays no visible price for her victory, undercutting the story's tension and the stakes' perceived danger.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a single, poignant stake and escalates pressure effectively through the inexorable sunrise and the chemical timer. This countdown serves as a powerful deepening of the initial situation, forcing the climactic action. The cost—the loss of the object's living presence in exchange for its permanent memory—is made tangible and directly informs the story's melancholy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes—the successful repair and its larger implication for autonomous navigation—are clear and compelling for this quiet story. Pressure escalates texturally, with the sounds of the departing ship providing a rhythmic deadline that deepens the scene's tension. The final image makes the cost of her success clear: her work enables journeys she will not take, a price paid in continued, solitary craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story signals its central stake—discovering and sharing the world's origin point—and escalates pressure through an accumulation of coherent, mystical signs. The tightening occurs when Mara deciphers the message, which transforms abstract signs into concrete knowledge. The cost of this knowledge is made palpable in the final lines, framing her new responsibility as both "terrifying and hopeful," a price paid in psychological weight rather than physical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the central stake—restoring balance—is clear, the conflict is one-sided and lacks tension. The tuner's success feels preordained, with no tangible obstacles, moments of potential failure, or meaningful price paid for the victory. The escalation is a smooth accumulation of success rather than a genuine tightening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    The initial stake of survival ("battery waning") establishes clear pressure, which meaningfully tightens when the temple demands a price, forcing a trade-off. Mara's choice to let the beacon fade is an active renunciation that forecloses a path. However, the core conflict feels resolved too easily; her fear simply dissolves into "calm resolve" after the vial's use, lessening the sense of an earned victory over a persistent internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—overcoming a legacy of false warnings—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The key turn, realizing his purpose is to guide others rather than save himself, provides a meaningful escalation of purpose. The resolution is earned, and the cost of accepting his past is clear in the final shift to peace.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—repaying a metaphysical debt—is established early and remains central. Under an accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively as each awakening brightens the bead, culminating in a powerful intensification: she must not just nurture, but sacrifice herself. The final cost, her very being, is unambiguous and paid on thepage, making the resolution feel earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin by defying old laws—is established, but the conflict remains largely abstract. The antagonistic force of the "old guilds" provides no on-page pressure; they appear only at the end, already defeated. Consequently, the escalation is a gentle accumulation of success rather than a tightening of tension, and the cost of breaking "broken precedents" is never viscerally felt, making the resolution feel soft.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of conflict and escalating pressure. The stakes—restoring faith—are declared but never face a genuine on-page test or opposition. Mara's journey is an unopposed success, which makes the resolution feel predetermined and low-impact; the potential danger suggested by the vanished scholars never materializes into present tension for her.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—successfully completing the ritual to mail the letter—is clear. However, the conflict is entirely procedural, a question of process rather than a struggle against a meaningful obstacle or internal resistance. The pressure never feels acute, and the possibility of failure is never truly felt, which limits the tension and the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story signals the dominant stake—the looming coup—early and builds pressure effectively under an accumulative lens. The conflict deepens not through reversals, but through the increasing specificity of the conspiracy's details, from a vague threat to a specific ledger and finally the falsified votes. This intensification forces the protagonist's hand, and her final action carries a clear, on-page cost, making the resolution feel consequential and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—the weight of unsent letters—is effectively externalized through the ritual. Pressure escalates texturally, with the spirits' song and the scale of the magic intensifying coherently. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency, and the cost of release is legible, making the final sense of peace feel earned rather than given.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—translating trauma into healing—is established early and tested. The narrative intensifies effectively when the anesthetic kicks in, serving as a meaningful deepening of pressure under the accumulative lens. The resolution is earned through the translator's agency, and the cost is made legible in the final, bittersweet ache she carries.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central stake—reviving a sorrowful place—is clear, but there is no meaningful conflict. The artist faces no opposition, setback, or internal struggle. The "knowledge network" provides a solution without any cost or effort, and the fog is a passive condition, not an antagonist. The resolution is achieved without any escalation of pressure, making the victory feel predetermined and emotionally inert.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story escalates its internal stake—certainty versus curiosity—by deepening the density of its fantastical phenomena, which is appropriate for the Accumulative lens. Lena's agency is present in her choice to engage, and the resolution involves a clear, stated cost. The stakes remain purely abstract and lack visceral weight because the initial state of "certainty" is an un-dramatized premise.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes—protecting freedom of thought—are high but remain abstract. The immediate conflict is well-realized when Dr. Mirabel's entrance creates a tangible threat of discovery. However, this pressure dissolves too easily with her immediate, unconflicted decision to join the rebellion, making the resolution feel convenient rather than hard-won. The cost is legible but lacks visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the poet's mission to transform pain into beauty—is signaled early and held consistently. The discovery of the postcard provides a meaningful deepening, focusing his general longing onto a specific goal: the "blossom armistice." The final resolution feels earned under the accumulative lens, with the cost of ages of sorrow being paid off in the triumphant, healing glow.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against oblivion and finding purpose in sorrow—is established immediately and held taut. For an accumulative story, the escalation works by deepening the emotional stakes rather than through causal turns. The arrival of the traveler is the single, decisive test of the caretaker's efforts, and the cost is legible in her final acceptance of the unending cycle of loss and preservation, which forecloses any hope of a final "victory" over forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake—restoring trust—and escalates the pressure by deepening the complexity of the task, which is an effective strategy under an Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned directly through the protagonist’s agency, and the final choice to accept the new vellum comes with the legible cost of ongoing duty. The conflict is primarily restorative rather than oppositional, but it is coherent and compellingly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the central stake is stated, it remains an abstraction. The core conflict is not dramatized on the page; Mira faces no tangible opposition, setback, or difficult trade-off in her task. Because the pressure is theoretical and the solution is implemented without a visible struggle or cost, the final harmony lacks the weight of an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—balancing loss and renewal—is signaled early and deepens with the discovery of the meteorite. The escalation is textural, accumulating meaning rather than external threats. The cost is legible and earned in the final image: accepting the "inevitable wilt of memory" is the price for creating a tangible, lasting map of her reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear initial stake (finding the exit) and deepens it effectively into a higher-stakes quest for understanding. The discovery of the hidden corridor serves as a meaningful tightening, foreclosing the simple path of escape and forcing a confrontation with the maze’s true nature. The cost is legible in the child's final, transformed identity as a guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—Aria's quest to learn the "rhythm of belonging"—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure escalates effectively when she must use the ancient instruments, representing the peak test of her communion. While the conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, it deepens coherently toward a resolution with a felt, if not physical, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—discovering why paths disappear—is established immediately and remains the focus. Pressure deepens appropriately for the textural lens as Maren gathers clues, culminating in the test at the fissure. The resolution is driven by her agency (placing the final seed), and the cost is legible in her acceptance of a permanent "hopeful sorrow," a nuanced price that redefines her purpose and forecloses a simpler, less complete understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    While the central stake—proving order can be drawn from chaos—is philosophical, the story creates a compelling escalation of intensity. The progression from one bishop, to two, to the addition of ink and then music, effectively deepens the performance. The cost is the fleetingness of the "perfect fragment," a subtle but legible price that makes the performer's ongoing quest meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—achieving a unique artistic ambition—is clear and compelling. The conflict is appropriately internal for the story's mode, focusing on Lira's need to "fledge her own limits." The pressure escalates through a steady, ritualistic intensification rather than external reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly, and the cost of success is a profound, earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—Mira's search for peace amid "unsettled thoughts"—is low and entirely internal. Under an Accumulative lens, there is no meaningful increase in pressure or density; the ritual proceeds smoothly to its intended conclusion without complication or resistance. The resolution is not earned against any opposition, making the conflict feel static and the final shift in perspective predetermined rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Maren's attempt to transform her pain—is clear. The escalation from a private ritual to a public act provides a meaningful deepening of her commitment. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal, and the villagers present no resistance, only acceptance. The lack of external pressure or a more tangible trade-off makes the resolution feel less hard-won, softening the potential impact of the cost she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—revitalizing communal hope—is established early and pursued consistently. The conflict is primarily conceptual, pitting Arin's methodical inquiry against a mystery. While the pressure builds effectively through the trial balloon experiments, the final resolution lacks a tangible cost. The "unsettling" of the old council is mentioned but not dramatized, making the victory feel intellectually satisfying but emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—understanding the walls' dreams—and deepens it effectively under an accumulative lens. Lira’s agency drives the discovery, and the climax provides a meaningful reweighting of her quest. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the "legacy's burden" is transformed rather than paid for, making the price of her new understanding purely conceptual and less viscerally felt than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—persuading the mirrors—is clear, and the "hush before the bells" provides a ticking clock that creates some tension. The conflict is entirely external and metaphysical, with no internal opposition from the protagonist. The resolution feels preordained rather than hard-won, as the painter's success is achieved with an unwavering grace and no visible setbacks or trade-offs, lessening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—achieving peace—is clear from the start. The escalation is textural, deepening the ritual's solemnity rather than introducing causal turns, which suits the chosen lens. However, the conflict feels low-friction; the chieftains' capitulation seems inevitable, reducing the sense of a genuine, hard-won victory against entrenched opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo—is established early and pursued with meticulous focus. Pressure escalates through the environmental constraint of waiting for the thunder's lull, a perfect tightening beat for this textural story. The immense cost of the manufactured drought provides a powerful counterweight to the delicate, personal nature of the goal, making the final resolution feel complex and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central conflict—the individual against systemic conformity—is effectively externalized in the struggle to unlock the sanctuary. The escalation, driven by the protagonist's deliberate actions, builds texturally as each echo is freed. The final resolution is earned by her agency, and the cost—her vanishing from the world she changed—gives the victory a poignant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully dramatizes a high-stakes internal conflict. The central pressure is not external but philosophical: how to tell stories ethically. This stake is signaled early and deepens through Selene's deliberate, ritualistic actions, culminating in a decisive choice. The final epiphany serves as a meaningful tightening, forcing a renunciation of control and making the cost—a more vulnerable mode of creation—unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, poignant stake: honoring the forgotten against the forces of time and indifference. The pressure is effectively deepened by the timeframe of the monarch migration, creating a single, powerful point of intensification as the last butterfly passes. Lira’s agency is clear, and the resolution is earned through her actions, with the cost—her continued, lonely guardianship—resonating strongly in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory to achieve personal redemption—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates coherently through the delicate, high-stakes ritual of reconfiguring the rope. The resolution is earned directly through Mara's agency, and the arrival of the traveler provides a final, meaningful deepening of the stakes, demonstrating their persistence into the future.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict succeeds under its Accumulative lens, with pressure intensifying through the storm, the seal's humming, and the protagonist's ritual focus. The central stake—understanding the paths—is tested and resolved in a single, decisive deepening of knowledge. The resolution is earned by the character's action, and the cost of this new understanding is clearly established in the rewritten directive.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant to ensure the people's prosperity—is signaled clearly. The pressure is well-defined by the "fleeting window" between regimes, providing a coherent reason for the urgency. The central conflict is more situational and internal than external, but the story executes a meaningful deepening of Nabu's commitment, culminating in a choice with a visible cost (the new pact symbolized by glyphs).

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—releasing the monks' resentment—is clear, but the conflict lacks significant escalation or pressure. Mara’s plan succeeds with a frictionless ease that undermines the tension; there is no counter-pressure, setback, or moment where the plan might fail. While the final cost for the wanderer is felt, the path to it lacks the feeling of a hard-won victory against genuine opposition, making the resolution feel more inevitable than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—capturing a communal dream—and escalates pressure through the successful execution of the ritual. Under the accumulative lens, the intensification is effective. However, the conflict lacks a true counter-pressure or moment of near-failure, as the environment is entirely collaborative, making the protagonist's victory feel somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s need to find a renewed purpose—is effectively externalized in the desire to mend the quartz. The pressure escalates well from a small, tangible problem (the ribbon) to the larger, symbolic one (the eyes). Protagonist agency drives the resolution, but the conflict feels low-friction; the solution presents itself without significant struggle or a costly trade-off in the moment, relying on a conveniently available toolkit.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a strong, coherent intellectual stake: understanding the paradoxical nature of nonlinear inheritance. The pressure effectively deepens when the great-grandmother's vision reframes the cameo from an object to be filled into a key to be used, narrowing the protagonist's options and forcing a new approach. The final resolution is directly driven by the protagonist's choice to accept the paradox, and the cost—a permanent shift in his perception of reality—is clear and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the library—is signaled early and escalates effectively from an intellectual puzzle to a direct confrontation with a supernatural obstacle. The tightening occurs when Selene must use a piece of her only clue to solve the puzzle, a choice driven by her agency that carries a clear cost. The conflict is resolved through the protagonist's specific skills, making the victory feel earned and consequential within the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is clearly established, but the story suffers from a near-total lack of conflict or escalation. The protagonist proceeds through her tasks unopposed, with all necessary tools at hand, making the resolution feel preordained rather than earned through struggle. This absence of pressure or a meaningful tightening before the climax is a significant structural weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear metaphysical stake—resolving the paradox of the impossible door—and pursues it with focus. The protagonist's agency drives the entire resolution, from identifying the key (the seal) to performing the climactic action (reweaving the rope). The cost is made tangible in the final beat as the tower's mechanism stills, successfully paying off the escalation with a permanent consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring quiet—is established immediately and pursued with unwavering focus. The arrival of the energy beings creates a coherent pressure that is resolved through the protagonist's direct agency. The final cadence shift from a "storm of resonant frequencies" to a "bloom of hush" represents a meaningful turn, with the cost of perpetual vigilance providing a satisfying sense of earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story signals its dominant stake—a philosophical quest for meaning—and successfully deepens it. The rekindling acts as the initial test, while the arrival of the caravan provides a powerful escalation, transforming the stakes from personal validation to communal survival. This progression feels earned and reweights the final image with a clear, albeit hopeful, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story builds pressure effectively around a single, dominant philosophical stake: the nature of identity. The escalation is a deepening of understanding, driven entirely by the protagonist's agency as he tests his conjecture. The final resolution carries a clear, felt cost—the shift from personal grief to a more impersonal, collective purpose—making the internal conflict and its resolution satisfyingly complex for this textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a strong, coherent internal stake—defying hopelessness—and escalates pressure texturally rather than causally. The intensification of ritual (chanting, preparing the knot) leads to a climactic choice driven entirely by the protagonist's agency. The cost is felt in the final paragraph's commitment to an ongoing struggle, providing an earned, if quiet, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the conflict is superb. The dominant stake—understanding the pause—is clear, and pressure deepens through the accumulation of tangential clues rather than direct confrontation. The shift from predicting words to feeling intention is a meaningful deepening of the stakes, resolved with a subtle cost that feels appropriately scaled to the story.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Lio's internal struggle against confinement—is established early and tested in the climax. Under an Accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively when Lio's agency leads to the realization that purity requires restraint ("limiting exposure"). This choice creates an unmistakable cost: he cannot have all the silences at once, forcing a trade-off that enriches the resolution and gives it weight.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—creating a profound, comforting silence—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict is primarily textural, pitting Lira's deliberate actions against the ambient noise and internal agitation. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively towards the climax where the vial bursts, marking a decisive intensification. The cost is legible in the spent vial and the self-discipline required, resulting in an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most critical failure. While a dominant stake is signaled—claim the throne before sunrise—it is never tested. There is no opposition, no obstacle, and no moment of meaningful escalation or pressure; Mina's success is a foregone conclusion. The time limit of "sunrise" exists as a label but creates no tangible tension, resulting in a conflict that is entirely static and a narrative devoid of dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming the metaphysical "suffocating darkness"—is established early and pursued with focus. Pressure escalates effectively under the textural lens, culminating in the keeper's decision to burn his bridges, an act that meaningfully tightens the stakes by foreclosing the option of retreat. This choice makes his final step through the threshold a committed, costly action, earning the story's quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to trust a new form of promise after being burned by an old one—is established early and effectively deepened. The escalation works well for the textural lens, cohering as a series of invitations that force a stance crystallization rather than a chain of causal events. The protagonist's agency in the final choice is clear, though the felt cost of the resolution is somewhat subtle, residing in the conditional nature of the diamonds.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a hidden truth—is signaled early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict is primarily internal and textural, escalating as Lian must trust his intuition against the silence. The final revelation provides a meaningful deepening of the stakes, shifting his goal from recovery to reinterpretation, and the cost (accepting a shameful truth over a noble lie) is clear and felt in his new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is the knight's internal conflict between his withdrawn nature and a new sense of purpose. Pressure escalates atmospherically, culminating in the choice to "unsnap the lock," a decisive act that deepens his commitment. The cost is clearly dramatized in the final beat: the dissolution of his solitary self into a new, connected existence. The escalation feels more like a single, decisive deepening than a gradual tightening, but it is effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is Amelia's internal quest for meaning, which is well-established. However, the conflict lacks significant escalation. The primary source of external pressure—the bureaucracy—is represented by a supervisor who capitulates instantly, dissolving tension rather than heightening it. The resolution feels earned for Amelia's internal state, but the lack of a robust test makes the victory feel soft.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—igniting resistance against indifference—is established early and decisively addressed. The escalation is a single, powerful deepening of the conflict rather than a series of turns, which perfectly suits the accumulative lens. The climax is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost is made legible in the final beat, solidifying the stakes as real and lasting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing a fiery apocalypse—is established early and provides a grave undertone to the quiet action. The central conflict is resolved through the protagonist's focused agency, with the performance serving as a sustained deepening of pressure. The cost is legible in the "weight of every unspoken promise," making the final peace feel earned and fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the forest's message—is established early and pursued consistently. The conflict escalates effectively under the accumulative lens when the leaf ignites and enhances Lira's senses, a meaningful deepening of her capabilities and the stakes. The final resolution is earned through her actions, with the cost of her transformation making the victory poignant and substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s internal conflict between control and uncertainty—is established early and tested throughout her journey. The pressure deepens effectively when she must pass through the waterfall, a physical risk that escalates her conceptual quest. The resolution is earned within the story's accumulative logic, but the conflict lacks a strong opposing force, making the final choice feel more like an inevitable acceptance than a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—understanding the weight of a name to redeem a broken object and self—is established early and pursued with focus. The escalation during the delicate repair process functions effectively within the story’s accumulative design. The conflict’s power is diminished by the same weakness affecting the plot: the resolution is earned through action but lacks a discernible cost, softening the stakes’ ultimate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—healing the spirits' sorrow—is clear and intensifies effectively. The pressure builds texturally from discordant grief to an internal "luminous ache" in Mara. The climax, where her joke turns sorrow to laughter, represents a decisive deepening of her method, and the cost of her taking on the initial grief is felt. The resolution is directly tied to her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—transmuting trauma into a formula for mercy—and escalates the pressure coherently. Each act of "bracing" against the violet light represents a meaningful deepening of the conflict, with the cost being the endurance of remembered pain. The resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist's agency in choosing to endure this process.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stake—honoring overlooked histories by unsealing a memory—is clear and poignant. The story executes a meaningful deepening when the patterns converge and the ritual succeeds. However, the conflict lacks friction or a sense of potential failure; the narrator's success feels preordained, making the process feel more like a beautiful demonstration than a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and escalates pressure effectively as Mara moves deeper into the circus's secrets. Her agency drives the investigation forward. However, the resolution feels unearned because it relies on a convenient and illogical plot device (the elevator circuit) rather than the protagonist overcoming obstacles within the established constraints, which deflates the tension at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—compressing eternity—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict deepens effectively when Mara decides to use the "bottled whisper," an act of agency that leads directly to the climactic "rupture." The cost is the destruction of an illusory perfection, a conceptual price made tangible on the page, resulting in a well-earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—using the shard to spark a cultural renaissance—is clear and compelling. The plan's execution provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. However, the external conflict with the "elders of the opposing camps" resolves too easily; their arguments are "softened" by the atmosphere rather than overcome by a direct challenge, which lessens the sense of a hard-won victory. The cost is legible in Lira's "burnished sorrow," but the opposition feels more like a premise than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the potential drowning of the village in sorrow—is established immediately and remains the focus. Pressure escalates via a simple ticking clock as midnight approaches, which is effective. The conflict lacks a significant reversal or complication; Alder's success, while earned through his skill, feels inevitable, which lessens the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—to find a place beyond explanation—is signaled early and escalates beautifully under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pressure deepens not through an antagonist but through the increasing strangeness of the environment, forcing a stance crystallization in Mara. The climax, where she steps onto the water, is a decisive choice with a clear cost: the surrender of her old, empirical worldview and the literal loss of her guiding tool, which earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—Mira's artistic struggle to capture historical interconnectedness—is clear and well-suited to the textural drive. The conflict intensifies effectively when the lantern's visions present her with overwhelming complexity. Her decision to create the compass sculpture is a decisive act of agency that resolves the tension, and the cost (committing to a more demanding, endless process) is legible in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—Mara’s need to reckon with a question—and it's signaled early and held throughout. The story achieves a meaningful deepening of this stake through the climactic vision, which reconfigures her understanding and resolves her internal conflict. The cost is legible and felt as she sheds her "lingering winter," fulfilling the requirements for a strong accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering a silenced history—is established early and remains the central focus. The story presents a linear sequence of obstacles, but it lacks genuine escalation or a meaningful tightening of pressure. Mara overcomes each challenge without facing a difficult trade-off, a moment of near-failure, or paying a tangible cost, which prevents the conflict from building to a truly tense and earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear and compelling internal conflict: an earned, truthful revival versus the temptation of easy magic. The pressure escalates through the sheer imaginative labor required of the alchemist, and the resolution is earned by his unwavering commitment to his difficult method. The cost—a perpetual duty to tend the town's memory—is visible and gives the ending its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding the prophecy's meaning for the city and Harel's duty—is signaled early and deepens effectively. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating as Harel realizes the prophecy is not a simple warning but a "map of emotional currents" tied to his life's work. The final reinterpretation of the prophecy is a decisive turn that reweights the stakes from destruction to preservation, with the cost being the burden of this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reopening the ancient covenant—is established immediately. Pressure escalates texturally as the vortex forms and the environment transforms, culminating in a clear climactic moment.

The cost is metaphysical but legible, resulting in an earned resolution that satisfies the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—a delicate technical procedure against a deadline—is well-defined and sustained. The stake (achieving a new form of listening) is clear, and the ten-minute wait for the glue provides a tangible point of tension. The successful outcome is earned through the protagonist's patience and precision, making the resolution feel deserved, though the pressure remains controlled rather than escalating to a higher level of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal conflict is well-defined: the janitor’s yearning to transform vulnerability into strength. The dominant stake is spiritual and existential. The narrative deepens effectively when the janitor moves from passive empathy to an active vow, which is the story's pivotal turn. The tremor and luminescent ribbon provide a tangible consequence, confirming the stakes are real, and the cost of empathy is clearly established as feeling the "sorrow and triumph" of each star.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear, abstract stake (preserving unspoken words) and successfully deepens it into a concrete choice to honor the covenant. The escalation is textural, culminating in a moment of understanding that forecloses the option of speaking. The cost—the eternal burden of silence—is palpable and earned by the protagonist’s final, quiet action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the capsule's purpose before the "last grain of sand slipped through"—is signaled early and drives the narrative. The pressure escalates as a deepening of knowledge, which fits the Accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a palpable trade-off; the threat of the hourglass dissipates, and Mara achieves her goal without a visible price, which keeps the conflict from reaching its full potential intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the poet's internal quest to "harmonize discord"—is clear. The "sudden gust" provides a recurring point of pressure that deepens his philosophical stance, forcing a trade-off between a desire for stillness and an acceptance of flaws. While the conflict is coherent for the story's lyrical mode, its repetition diminishes the sense of escalation, making the pressure feel cyclical rather than mounting towards a final, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The initial stake—a six-month deadline that reads like a death sentence—is high. However, the pressure fails to escalate meaningfully. Mara's unwavering calm keeps the tension at a distance, and the conflict is resolved by a magical intervention that converts the council off-page, rather than by a choice made under direct pressure. The resolution lacks a felt cost, softening the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—Arin's quest for understanding versus the scholars' passive awe—is established early and tested. Pressure deepens effectively when the tower's vibration responds directly to Arin's experiment, forcing a re-evaluation of his methods and worldview. This turn is driven by his agency, and the cost (the loss of his detached skepticism) is made legible through the dimming of the amber.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming life from the ashes of war and ecological death—is signaled early and held consistently. The conflict deepens effectively when the gull's call confirms the "submerged concord," a key turning point that shifts the coachman's effort from hope to certainty. The cost is historical and vast (the dead reef, the fallen empire), which provides a powerful, poignant weight to the small, successful act of renewal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Rook's search for renewed purpose—is clear, and the story achieves a meaningful deepening of this stake by its conclusion. However, the conflict lacks tangible pressure or escalation. There are no obstacles, trade-offs, or opposing forces, which keeps the tension at a low, consistent level rather than allowing it to build toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict is compellingly internal: a struggle against despair to find meaning. The stake—whether the protagonist will find a path forward or remain lost—is signaled early and consistently held. The pressure deepens decisively when the sketched constellation aligns with the compass, providing a "glimpse" that transforms the protagonist's knowledge and crystallizes their resolve. This turn effectively escalates the internal stakes from hope to commitment, with the cost being the embrace of a solitary pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—amending the curse—is established early and pursued relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abstract stake—memory versus oblivion—is successfully dramatized through concrete, symbolic action. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which suits the story's mode.

This escalation and its associated cost are legible and earned by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a powerful, singular stake: Lira’s need to define home against the crushing erasure of the mountain. The escalation is purely internal but potent, tightening decisively when "remembering becomes painful." Her choice to push through this pain by pressing the feather deeper is an act of agency that directly leads to the climax, with the emotional cost of confronting trauma being clear and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central, internal stake of self-forgiveness is established immediately and tested directly. The narrative successfully deepens the conflict by forcing the protagonist to confront specific memories—the pawn, the queen—as he navigates the labyrinth. The resolution is driven by his decisive internal action at the crystal altar, and the cost is the surrender of his long-held rage and regret, which is made legible in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stake—achieving collective forgiveness—is established early and pursued with clear agency by the protagonist. The conflict deepens effectively under the accumulative lens as the poetry session gathers momentum, intensifying the emotional pressure. The final resolution feels earned through Mara's actions, and the cost is made explicit on the page ("a piece of herself," "acceptance of loss").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—fulfilling the promise to find "temporary eternity"—is signaled early and effectively tightened when the abstract quest becomes a concrete task with the discovery of the key.

The resolution is earned through the character's direct action and subsequent internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)

The final appearance of the ships provides a powerful, earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    A clear dominant stake is established, and the confrontation with the smugglers provides a meaningful tightening point. However, the resolution feels too swift and lacks a tangible cost for the protagonist or a convincing struggle from the opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant internal stake is signaled early and resolved. Under an Accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies effectively toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of meaningful conflict or stakes. The central question—will the experiment work?—is answered with an immediate and frictionless "yes." There is no sense of risk, no opposition, and no escalation of pressure; the process unfolds exactly as planned. The resolution is achieved without a cost paid or a difficult trade-off, which diminishes the narrative tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's need for atonement—is powerfully established and tested against a firm deadline (the felling of the trees).

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cosmic stakes are established early and remain the dominant focus. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict intensifies through a clear progression of ritualistic acts, each deepening the protagonist's engagement with the temple's core.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central conflict consists of solving a series of puzzles, but the execution lacks tension. Mara solves each cryptic scrawl with ease, facing no setbacks, false leads, or moments of genuine struggle.

The pressure is static, progressing linearly from one solved clue to the next without any meaningful tightening or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)

    The dominant stake—unsealing the embryo to reshape tradition—is clear and compelling. The pressure escalates to the ritual's climax, where Anara pays a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully dramatizes a philosophical stake—the quest for knowledge—and deepens it through the ritual. The pressure builds not through external opposition but through the intensification of Kael's perception until he becomes part of the phenomenon he is studying.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—exposing a city-wide scandal—is established early, but the on-page pressure remains low.

    The central stake—resolving the "lilac unease" to find meaning—is well-defined and consistently held. Pressure escalates texturally rather than causally, which suits the story's mode. The creation of the mandala represents a decisive action that forces a resolution, and the cost (shedding assumptions) is legible, making the final state of calm feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a grand, civilizational stake but lacks immediate, tangible pressure. The conflict is entirely atmospheric and internal, with no external opposition or risk of failure presented on the page. While the protagonist acts to resolve the stake, the path to the solution is frictionless; he senses the answer, finds it, and implements it successfully. The lack of a meaningful test or trade-off weakens the escalation and makes the resolution feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—the ghost's yearning for a final encore to mend time—is established effectively. Pressure escalates well through the performance in the orchard, a clear deepening of the conflict under an Accumulative lens. The resolution is weakened because the final turn depends on the convenient arrival and action of the shopkeeper, which softens the impact of the protagonist's own struggle and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving neural resonance without a drug—is clear and consistent. Pressure deepens when Mara commits to the "true test" without external cues, creating a meaningful tightening. However, the conflict remains largely intellectual, with a low sense of risk or tangible cost for failure. The final breakthrough feels more like a successful-on-the-first-try experiment than a victory won against significant opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes, while metaphysical, are clearly established and pursued. Under an Accumulative lens, the conflict escalates effectively through a steady intensification of the magical phenomena, culminating in a powerful release. The protagonist's agency drives this process, and the cost—the transformation and release of the fossil—is a direct consequence of her success, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy—is clear and drives the narrative. However, the conflict unfolds more as a puzzle being solved than a struggle against opposition, which keeps the tension moderate. The escalation is a gentle deepening of knowledge rather than a sharp tightening of options, which is appropriate for the textural mode but lacks visceral impact. The resolution is earned by Mara's actions, but the personal cost is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the spy's quest for internal redemption—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict escalates through the deepening commitment to a mystical process, culminating in a non-physical but potent climax. The final choice to step into the pass is an act of agency that pays off the internal struggle with a visible cost (letting go of the past).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—resolving the "palimpsest promise"—is established early and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the tension effectively deepens through the device of the ticking rain gutters, which serves as a metronome counting down to the release.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)

The resolution is earned, and the cost—her perennial commitment—is visible in her final promise to the vines.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—awakening the library—is clear, but the conflict lacks pressure. There is no significant opposition, obstacle, or risk of failure dramatized on the page; Mira's method works precisely as intended. While the story posits a cost (her former isolation), the struggle associated with this transformation is absent, making the resolution feel preordained and diminishing the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Mira's search for connection—is clear, but the pressure is entirely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—community cohesion versus fracturing—is clear and consistently tested. The tricksters' false solar flare alarm provides a meaningful tightening point, where Mara’s agency directly averts disaster and demonstrates the cost of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story effectively establishes and escalates the primary internal conflict (claustrophobia vs. adventurousness) against the external goal. The tightening is palpable when the cavern walls begin to move, forcing a direct confrontation with the explorer’s fear in a moment of high physical stakes. The cost is legible, shifting from a physical price (risk of being crushed) to a conceptual one (the responsibility of new knowledge), which aligns with the story's aims. The resolution feels slightly too neat but is earned by the preceding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—resolving the cold cases and reawakening empathy—is clear. The discovery of the child's name on the ribbon provides a solid deepening of the conflict, making it personal. The escalation works within the story's magical-realist logic, but the final resolution is granted by the environment rather than seized through a costly trade-off, which slightly softens the impact of Mara's agency at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—activating the pixelated amnesty—is signaled early. The escalation is not one of rising action but of deepening commitment and convergence, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—decoding the inscription—is clear, but the conflict's pressure is low.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the frozen confession—is clearly signaled and maintained. Pressure escalates effectively through the ritualistic process, fitting the Accumulative lens with a single, decisive intensification. The resolution is earned by the druid's agency, and the cost is legible in the permanent transformation of the seed. The conflict's power is slightly diluted by the late, convenient introduction of the lost amulet, a secondary resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: unlocking the eclipsed covenant. Escalation is handled deftly through the Accumulative lens, deepening the visionary's understanding of the stakes from a pact of power to a duty to dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a new purpose beyond haunted ambition—is established early and tested through Lira's experiment. The escalation is accumulative, deepening when the seed reacts to her method, which validates her theory and opens a new path. This turn effectively forecloses her old, static purpose of preservation and forces the new, riskier choice of cultivation and sharing, with the cost of leaving the arbor's sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—preserving wonder in a world stalled—is established effectively. The pressure intensifies not through external threats but through an atmospheric deepening of quiet despair.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the fate of the floating city—is signaled early and effectively tightened by the coffee stain reading. However, the final confrontation deflates the pressure.

This lack of a final test for Elara's choice makes the resolution feel less like a victory against formidable odds and more like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—saving a spark before oblivion—and pursues it relentlessly.

The conflict is simple but executed with powerful coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stake—finding contentment—is well-established and the narrative builds coherent pressure toward the ritual that resolves it. The "tightening" is a crystallization of resolve rather than a causal escalation, which fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abstract stake—turning a rigid decree into a living conversation—is effectively dramatized through symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—discovering the color of sound—is established immediately and remains the focus. However, the story lacks meaningful escalation or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—finding purpose in a collapsing universe—is established early and remains the focus. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies effectively as Silas decodes the coins. The final instruction provides a meaningful tightening that forces a choice, and the resulting alignment carries a clear, philosophical cost that is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming nameless grief—is signaled early and escalated effectively. The deepening occurs as each named monster makes the “echo of sacrifice pulse louder,” intensifying the pressure on Lira’s own unresolved sorrow. The resolution is driven by her agency in naming her own loss, and the cost—the release of her identity as a mourner—is legible and earned in the final luminous ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external stakes are cosmic but grounded in a clear goal, and the escalation is steady and appropriate for the accumulative lens. However, the conflict lacks a true tightening or reversal; the process is slow but uninterrupted, and failure never feels like a present danger. The protagonist's "brittle devotion" is never forced to endure a crisis, making the resolution feel more inevitable than earned against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—expunging a communal myth—is well-defined and carries emotional weight. Escalation occurs as a deepening of knowledge through the photographs.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is clear and drives the narrative. The ritual provides a procedural escalation, and Selene's agency is constant.

Without a moment where failure seems possible or a sacrifice is required, the tension remains atmospheric rather than visceral, making the final victory feel pleasant but not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving trust—is established early and felt throughout. The pressure escalates appropriately when the radio fails, forcing the protagonist to act. However, the resolution is weakened by the aforementioned causal gap; because the protagonist's action (fixing a buckle) is not logically connected to the problem's solution (restored radio), the earnedness of the climax is compromised, resting on symbolism rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Mara’s living puzzle will succeed—is clear and effectively maintained. Pressure escalates methodically as the participants solve each cipher, with each success representing a step toward the climax. This linear accumulation of pressure is appropriate for the story's lens, and the final surge of air leading to the bloom provides a satisfying, earned resolution. The cost of failure is implied rather than viscerally threatened, slightly softening the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—restoring lost joy by combating a personified silence—is established early and pursued relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—the alchemist's agency against a "stifling destiny"—is established early and effectively externalized in the struggle to vivify the crozier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the city's rebirth—is clear, but the conflict lacks immediate pressure or escalation. The opposition is an abstract concept (decay, scholarly assumption) that Selin overcomes with professional competence. There is no on-page reversal or moment where her plan is jeopardized, making the resolution feel preordained. The story builds tension atmospherically but does not translate it into a compelling, high-stakes choice with a visible price for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the vanished ferry and timelines—is established early.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conceptual stake is clear and the narrative escalates by deepening its implications. However, the conflict lacks genuine pressure; the protagonist is a master of his craft who never seems to doubt, struggle, or risk failure. His "unsettling calm" and flawless execution of the "rational enchantment" transform a potential struggle into a beautiful but tensionless demonstration, keeping the stakes from feeling visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving starlight navigation to overcome the city’s isolation—is established early and tested directly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict between creative life and mechanical order is established immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming absence into presence—is clear and deepens thematically. However, the conflict is entirely atmospheric and lacks tangible opposition or the risk of failure.

The pressure escalates effectively for an Accumulative/Textural piece, deepening the mystical process until it culminates in the projection. Mara's agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—capturing a runaway dream—is established early and deepened effectively under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—freeing an idea from fear—is established immediately and remains the focus.

The narrative deepens this stake effectively, moving from the internal act of creation to external tests: the storm and, more significantly, the traveler's plea. The pruner's decision to give away a sprig is a decisive turn driven by agency, demonstrating a commitment to spreading wonder rather than hoarding it, which provides a satisfying and costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The stakes—grounding restless spirits to calm their grief—are established immediately and held in sharp focus. Escalation operates texturally, with each undone knot deepening the accumulated silence and intensifying the ritual's effect, which is a masterful application of the Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned through Elara’s sustained effort, with the cost of her "lucid unrest" transforming into a palpable, story-wide calm.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a strong, singular stake: to interpret the silence of the map's tear. The conflict is conceptual and atmospheric, escalating through a process of accumulation rather than direct opposition. The key deepening occurs when the protagonist's methodical alignment of images forces a new understanding, a moment of agency that changes knowledge and redefines the "problem" as a solution. The cost is emotional—acknowledging centuries of loss—which is fitting for the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes and deepens a single, coherent internal stake: understanding and achieving "letting go." Pressure builds texturally through the act of untangling, culminating in the transmission which forces a stance crystallization. The cost—the acceptance of his own end and the shattering of the globe—is legible and appropriate for the accumulative design, making the resolution feel earned within its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—the need for connection between the organic and the digital—escalates cleanly through three distinct stages, driven by the protagonist's agency. The stakes deepen from a hopeful attempt to a direct dialogue and finally to a full synthesis. The final cost, a mutual transformation into a permanent, shared state, is legible and earned, providing a satisfying resolution to the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    A clear thematic stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is established early and effectively deepened by the discovery of a concrete path to its resolution. Protagonist agency drives the escalation. However, the conflict's resolution feels somewhat frictionless; the "ache of the spire's sorrow" is melted into "pervasive contentment" a bit too easily, slightly diminishing the felt cost of the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully portrays an internal conflict with clear stakes: the struggle to find meaning in loss. Pressure deepens effectively not through external events but through a focused intensification of the character's internal process, making the final resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—completing the mural before the noon demolition—and maintains coherent pressure through this deadline. The conflict is effectively intensified by the ticking clock, forcing Lira to work with measured precision. Her final act of pressing the coin into the mural is a decisive choice that crystallizes her stance against her limits, with the building's collapse serving as a powerful, on-page cost that makes her artistic defiance resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear stake—charting a new beacon for navigation—but the conflict is low-pressure. It functions as an intellectual puzzle that Lira solves without significant setbacks, opposition, or rising tension. The introduction of the "life-force" risk is a good attempt at raising the stakes, but it is overcome too easily to create meaningful escalation or a palpable sense of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—mending broken time—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively from a search to a delicate, high-stakes act of repair. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's specific agency (using the key, whispering the prophecy), and the cost is legible in the final feeling of nostalgic duty, successfully foreclosing any path other than continuing his lonely work.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.1)
    This category represents a critical failure. The story contains no discernible conflict or meaningful stakes that are ever at risk. The villagers' success is a foregone conclusion, and the narrative simply depicts the frictionless execution of a plan. The absence of any opposition, internal doubt, or external pressure renders the concept of escalation moot.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—pausing the world’s relentless ticking—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict is primarily atmospheric, escalating through the single, decisive intensification of the lullaby ritual, which is a valid structure under the textural lens. The resolution is earned by Elara’s direct action, and the cost of her success is made clear in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—completing the ritual before the frost—and escalates pressure effectively. The tightening is felt as the caretaker approaches the altar, with the birds' humming growing louder. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated in the deliberate, ritualistic act, and the cost is legible not as a physical loss, but as the profound emotional price of temporary, "graceless" redemption, which aligns perfectly with the story's textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal conflict—Mara's struggle with failure—is well-established and drives the narrative. The central stake of redemption is clear. The story features a strong deepening moment when the insight from the foam changes her options. However, the external resolution ("cured fractures in bridges across the region") is reported rather than shown, which significantly lowers the felt tension and makes the ultimate success feel abstract and less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conceptual stake—finding the origin of stories—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict escalates through a deepening of knowledge rather than a conventional reversal, which fits the story's textural drive. The vendor’s action of ‘incising’ the map provides a clear pivot, and the resolution is earned with a visible cost: his purpose is fulfilled and dissolves, fundamentally changing his state.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—healing the collective, contagious remorse—is established immediately and remains the focus. The pressure escalates effectively under the textural lens when Lir's tasting begins to spread the sorrow, causing the pavilion to crack. The climax is driven by his agency, and the cost is legible and poignant: the destruction of the ancient pavilion in exchange for a fragile, uncertain peace.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—healing the city—is established, but the conflict remains an abstract background concept. There is no on-page opposition, complication, or resistance to the librarian's plan. Because her agency is unopposed and her success is immediate, the story lacks tension and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through overcoming pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake and escalates pressure effectively through the tremor. This event tests the protagonist's resolve, forcing an on-page choice that reaffirms her goal at a moment of tangible risk ("the stone could fracture"). The conflict successfully translates an abstract goal into a visceral, engaging sequence with a legible cost of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake (finding combinations) and uses the "hour of inverted gravity" as an effective temporal pressure that tightens the narrative. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and unique abilities ("prism mind"), and the cost—a lifelong commitment to vigilance—is made legible in the final paragraph. The escalation is concise but impactful for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can empathy be made audible in a silent world?—is signaled early and remains the focus. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively as Auris decodes each crack, turning the process into an escalating act of translation. The cost is the vicarious processing of the sculpture's "pain," which is a potent idea. However, the conflict is entirely internal and unopposed, lacking any external friction or risk of failure beyond the metaphorical weight of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully establishes and deepens a dominant internal stake: finding purpose in exile. The pressure escalates texturally, culminating in a decisive internal shift when the tutor reinterprets the covenant. This turn is driven by his agency and carries the cost of accepting sorrow as a permanent guide, making the final stance feel earned and resonant under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    A clear dominant stake—recovering the diary's contents—is signaled early and resolved through the protagonist's actions. The pressure escalates atmospherically as the frequencies are tuned. However, the conflict lacks a palpable sense of risk; the protagonist's competence is never in doubt, which keeps the tension from feeling truly sharp or the outcome uncertain. The cost is conceptual and delayed until the final vow, rather than being felt during the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—Lira’s quest for serenity—is established, but the conflict lacks significant tension or escalation. The outcome never feels in doubt, as Lira executes her plan with perfect patience and foresight. While the passage of time provides a form of pressure, the absence of any real risk or internal struggle makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and resolved. The inverted hour provides a frame of pressure, and the discovery of the artifact presents a clear tightening point where Mira must decide what to do. However, the conflict lacks significant opposition or setbacks; Mira finds the object with relative ease, which keeps the tension from escalating to its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—dissipating the storm's lingering energy—is clear and the pressure builds effectively through the survey. However, the resolution lacks a proportional cost or struggle. The "singular convergence" is resolved not by a difficult choice or clever application of science, but by a whisper, releasing the pressure in a "gentle sigh." The conflict deflates rather than resolves with earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder—is abstract and lacks immediate, tangible opposition, resulting in low tension. Under an Accumulative lens, the song provides a single, decisive deepening of the initial state. However, the conflict feels more like a ritual performance than a struggle, and the cost (the world's unawareness) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, limiting the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear, internal stake—redefining guardianship—and escalates pressure through a coherent ritual that deepens that stake. The protagonist’s agency is central to the resolution, and the climax provides a meaningful shift in her understanding and purpose. The cost, the burden of her new knowledge, is felt and gives the ending its gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully builds pressure around a highly abstract, internal stake: proving a theorem of emotion. The escalation is handled not through external opposition but through an intensification of sensory and conceptual input, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly. The climax provides a decisive deepening of the stakes, reframing her finite goal into an infinite one, with the cost of her original tool and the acceptance of a perpetual quest being unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—to spread wonder and honor a legacy—is established early and tested through two encounters of escalating significance. The courier's agency drives the plot, moving from rekindling a shepherd's spark to unlocking ancient knowledge for a young girl. The final cost, his absorption into myth, is a fitting consequence of his success, providing a poignant resolution that feels earned by his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual and emotional stake and successfully deepens the pressure through a focused intensification of the central ritual. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's direct agency, and the conceptual cost—the new weight of responsibility—is made legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—sending a message to overcome the "raveling silence"—is established immediately and remains the focus. Pressure deepens effectively when Mara accepts the necessity of sacrifice, which represents a meaningful intensification of the cost. The final act resolves the conflict through her agency, and the price paid (the bead's dimming, her personal loss) is visible on the page, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming internal failure to find resilience—is signaled early and remains the focus. The plot provides a single, meaningful escalation where the blacksmith must confront his past to proceed, and the cost is paid on the page. This direct link between the internal stake, the external obstacle, and the price paid makes the conflict feel earned and resonant for this story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering a withheld truth—is signaled early and escalates effectively when the protagonist finds the trapped crew, raising the stakes from knowledge to action. The final choice pays off this escalation with a clear, costly action. However, the pressure feels somewhat theoretical; the protagonist faces no direct opposition or significant setback, making the path to resolution feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict operates on a strong, internal axis, with the dying lamp externalizing a threat to hope itself. The stake is signaled early and deepens meaningfully from Marek's personal nostalgia to a protective vow for all sailors. The protagonist's agency in performing the ritual directly confronts the pressure, and the cost is made unmistakable in the final beat as a persistent, carried ache.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—shaping a new dawn—is established early and tested by the ritual's demands and the fleeting timeline ("before the tide erases our chance"). The escalation is a clear deepening of the ritual's power, as the beam becomes a "living serpent." The cost is legible and paid on the page: the old world is gone, and the new one is defined by a permanent "shadowed elation," a clear trade-off that redefines hope.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central conflict is almost nonexistent. The stake—to learn why people magnetize stories—is intellectual, and Lira faces no opposition, obstacle, or meaningful trade-off in her quest. The answers and tools she needs are presented to her without cost or struggle. This lack of escalating pressure makes the resolution feel inert, as nothing was truly at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—transforming the labyrinth's sorrow—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure escalates texturally as Eli engages more deeply with the dream-data and the grid's hum. The resolution is driven by his agency, and the cost is legible in the easing of his own sorrow, but the conflict lacks a moment of genuine doubt or a significant tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Pressure escalates texturally, from the first notes of song to the arrival of the spirits, which creates a feedback loop enabling the climax. The final release is a decisive deepening of Lira's commitment, with the cost of her permanent guardianship made clear, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant internal stake—reconciling a past mistake—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure deepens when the curator directly challenges the recluse, forcing a confession that acts as the key turning point. The resolution is earned within the story's symbolic terms, with the cost being the dissolution of his isolated sanctuary in favor of engaging with the world, a clear trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is entirely internal, focused on the dominant stake of finding sanctity in the mundane. The discovery of the warm bread provides a meaningful deepening of this stake, raising the possibility of a tangible connection to the past. The climax—sharing the bread with an empty chair—is a quiet but decisive act that crystallizes the character's stance, with the cost being a poignant acceptance of loneliness alongside peace.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are compellingly philosophical: conjuring meaning against oblivion. Pressure escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens, with the meticulous process and the fading external world creating a palpable sense of urgency. The resolution is earned through the chief's sustained, focused agency, and the cost is made tangible as the vows settle on her, not as a burden but as a "map"—a beautiful reconfiguration of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the "truce of hush until sunrise"—is established early and tested directly through Lila's agency. The conflict escalates cleanly from a strategic decoy to a direct physical confrontation, narrowing Lila's options and forcing a decisive choice. The cost is clear: the truce is momentarily broken, reinforcing its fragility and ensuring the final victory feels precarious and earned, not final.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The core epistemological stake—understanding the weather carriers—is established early and deepened effectively through the accumulative structure. The pressure builds not through external threat but through an intensification of data that forces a re-evaluation. The resolution provides a clear conceptual cost, as Arin's foundational skepticism is overturned by an undeniable experience.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Lena's internal creative block, externalized as the broken lock—is established early and held throughout. The pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens, intensifying the "auroral sorrow" until the climax. The final choice has a clear, felt cost: sorrow is not eliminated but integrated, which is a sophisticated resolution. The escalation feels more textural than causal, which fits the chosen mode well.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear global stake—the health of the city—but the conflict lacks sustained pressure. After the initial refusal to the council, there is no active opposition. The escalation is a sequence of discoveries rather than a tightening of contested choices. The resolution, a single whispered truth, feels disproportionately simple for the scale of the problem, making the earned cost feel more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against an abstract "fading"—is established but remains static. Under an accumulative lens, the story deepens this stake rather than escalating it, but there is no discernible moment of intensified pressure or a meaningful tightening. The conflict lacks a tangible test, rendering the tuner's endurance emotionally level rather than hard-won within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Vira’s internal static—is clear, but the external pressure used to test it is underdeveloped. The threat of a "controlled burn escape" is introduced only to be immediately neutralized by Vira’s decision to perform the burn herself, deflating the tension. This lack of sustained opposition or a meaningful escalation means the resolution feels managed rather than earned through struggle against mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the mystery to achieve healing—is clear, but the pressure lacks intensity. The conflict is primarily atmospheric, with the "intruding" commuters serving as the main external pressure point, which is brief and easily overcome by retreating to the courtyard. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned against significant opposition, and the cost (fading world noise) is more of a desired outcome than a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Selene's mission to transform vulnerability—is signaled early and tested under pressure. The rising tide serves as a simple but effective tightening mechanism, forcing her to enact her solution. The resolution is earned by her agency, and the cost of her success (the loss of her private sanctuary) is felt, creating a satisfying, albeit quiet, escalation arc appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of lost memory—is established early and pursued with focus. The narrative deepens effectively when the coffee grounds provide the key, forcing a decisive action from the protagonist. The resolution is earned through Mara's agency, and the cost is felt in the initial grief for the whale, which is transformed rather than erased by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes are cosmically high, the on-page conflict lacks tangible pressure or opposition. The ritual unfolds as a smooth, successful procedure without any sense of imminent failure, doubt, or external resistance. The escalation is a steady deepening of quiet rather than a tightening of contested stakes, which significantly lessens the story's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to a hidden form of knowledge—is signaled early and undergoes a meaningful deepening. The conflict pivots from an external interrogation to an internal acceptance of a paradoxical pact. The cost is legible and compelling: the protagonist must abandon their direct, controlling approach for a long-term, vulnerable apprenticeship built on trust.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal stake—transforming trauma into strength—is clearly signaled. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds as twilight deepens, creating a deadline for Lira's ritual. However, the escalation lacks texture; the conflict remains static until the final, abrupt resolution. The cost of her transformation is a reframing of past suffering rather than a price paid in the present, which lessens the impact of her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—forgiveness and resolution—and escalates it by introducing the legacy of the ancient scribes. This deepens the meaning of Liora's art and leads to a decisive ritual. The cost is legible in the consumption of the magical key, making the resolution feel tangible, though the contradiction noted in Q2 slightly dulls its final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—understanding the nature of echoes—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates texturally as the character gathers revelations, which deepens her resolve and draws her toward the story's core mystery. The final confrontation is with knowledge itself, and the resolution is earned through her persistence. While the pressure is more atmospheric than visceral, it coheres perfectly with the story's accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—to salvage a "pure essence"—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict escalates well under the Accumulative lens, shifting when the protagonist realizes she cannot simply release the essence but must orchestrate its return. This creates a meaningful tightening of her tactics, and the cost is the new, active journey she must undertake, which is made legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict is a quiet, internal pursuit of understanding, which is a valid stake for a textural piece. The shift from passive observation to the active ritual with the whisk provides a meaningful deepening. However, the stakes lack visceral weight; the cost of failure is never felt, and the conflict remains at a uniform, low pressure throughout, particularly as the second night simply reaffirms the success of the first without new complications.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of the stillpoint—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Pressure escalates effectively as night falls and the puzzle intensifies, leading to a climax that redefines the stakes. The final cost, Mira's newfound guardianship, is legible and earned by her actions, providing a solid, if linear, escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story signals its central stake—forging a "variant allegiance"—early and escalates pressure effectively under its accumulative lens. The meaningful deepening occurs when the visionary transitions from passively listening to actively harnessing the storm ("bind the darkness in copper coils"), which directly leads to the climax. The cost is the permanent rejection of the old world's power structure, made visible in the final image of the people below swearing allegiance to the new dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the poet's quest for redemption—is clear and tracked. The conflict deepens texturally as he collects more sounds, which aligns with the story's lens. However, the resolution feels unearned as it lacks a significant on-page cost; redemption is achieved through a fulfilling, frictionless process, and the final challenge of sharing the sounds is solved by the convenient appearance of the child, not by a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from a significant disconnect between its declared stakes and the dramatized conflict. The threat of the "storm-born seekers" is introduced as the primary motivation, yet they never appear, creating no tangible opposition or pressure. The on-page conflict is a solitary technical puzzle, which Elara solves methodically, resulting in low tension and no meaningful escalation of the core threat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal stake—sculpting patience from impatience—is signaled early and escalated effectively under the textural lens. The intensification is precise: the moon's apex triggers a surge in the viaduct's magnetic field, forcing Elara's moment of alignment. The resolution is earned through her active waiting and attention, and the cost of "unyoking" her restless yearning is made palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing future deaths by mapping and stopping the seepage—is established immediately. The conflict escalates through a deepening of knowledge when Mara connects the lantern's flicker to the humidity, shifting the problem from a general survey to a specific hunt. This turn is driven by her agency and leads directly to the resolution. The cost is the emotional and psychological shift into "fortified vulnerability," a credible price for moving from detached observer to active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central stake—the revival of a symbol of redemption—is well-established, and the pressure escalates from contemplation to physical intervention. However, the final resolution lacks a sufficient test or cost. The conflict is resolved by a convenient external event (the sunbeam), which dissipates the tension and removes the need for the characters to overcome a final, difficult obstacle through their own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell to satisfy the yearning algorithm—is established immediately and pursued relentlessly. Pressure escalates texturally rather than causally, culminating in the precise navigation required to brush the bell. The resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist's unique agency ("she engaged the transliteration protocol"), and the cost is the immediate renewal of longing, which cleverly redefines the nature of her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stake—solving a cold case—is immediately clear and deepens into a profound question about digital existence. The conflict escalates through Lia's direct agency when her fabricated post proves the system is hiding something, a perfect turn under the Causal lens. The resolution carries the undeniable cost of transforming her professional duty, making the stakes feel permanently reweighted and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring wholeness against the "cold silence of the sea"—is clear. The conflict is primarily environmental and conceptual. A meaningful deepening occurs as the protagonist views the futures in the mirrors, which solidifies her resolve and guides her final action. While the pressure is more atmospheric than oppositional, it aligns with the story's accumulative drive and culminates in a decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively escalates an internal, psychological stake. Pressure builds not through plot turns but through the deepening density of imagery related to endings, consistent with its textural drive. The final re-evaluation of solace represents a significant deepening of the stakes, with a clear, felt cost: the protagonist renounces her quest for self-annihilation in favor of a difficult, engaged acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—resolving the sentinel's internal sense of being "mismatched"—is clear and maintained. The conflict deepens texturally as he commits to the ritual of planting the letter, leading to a resolution that feels earned within the story's quiet logic. The pressure is consistent, though it lacks a sharp, decisive turn, opting instead for a gradual intensification that fits the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is subtle and internal, fitting the story's meditative tone. The dominant stake—the preservation of wisdom and the Keeper's role in it—is established and then tightened by the prophet's arrival. The resolution is an acceptance of his purpose, with the cost being a solitary, wandering existence. While the pressure is more atmospheric than overt, it coheres and deepens effectively under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake: achieving collective healing for the town. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict intensifies effectively as Mara constructs the photo-map, which builds pressure toward the climax. The arrival of the villagers provides a decisive test, and the cost of resolution—the open expression of grief ("tears fell like dew")—is visible on the page, confirming the stake was met.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: Mara's quest to find meaning in the patterns of language. The conflict is subtly but effectively escalated as the enigmatic crystal shifts from a passive object of study to an active respondent. This deepening, where the "chorus of quiet tones" answers her, marks a decisive turn that pays a visible cost on the page—the melting of her "weathered innocence" into a new, heavier resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—the prophet’s need to capture the sound of aging before he forgets it—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating as a deepening of longing rather than a series of external reversals. The climax at the monolith provides a decisive reweighting of the stake, and the final action carries the visible cost of accepting impermanence while still acting to remember.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes—harnessing a physics-defying force—are established immediately and the pressure is sustained by the "trembling walls." The escalation is a subtle deepening rather than a sharp turn, culminating in the moment the hand's spin is transferred. The resolution is earned through the sage's precise action, and the cost is legible in the bittersweet transformation of the "luminous ache."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye versus the chaos of an unmanaged death—is clear. Pressure builds appropriately for a textural piece, through the layering of sensory details. However, the conflict lacks friction; Mara is so proficient in her ritual that no real obstacle or resistance ever materializes, which softens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single, dominant stake is established early and pursued with clear protagonist agency. The escalation is a single, decisive deepening of knowledge when the ritual completes, which feels earned. The resolution comes with a clear cost—the mystery is solved, but the magical potential is now sealed and at rest, foreclosing that specific path of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Mara's internal "cleft in certainty"—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict deepens texturally, with the garden's growing "urgency" and the glowing tooth escalating the scene's magical-realist pressure. The central act of setting the vertebrae provides a meaningful turn, narrowing Mara's doubt with each click, which is a perfect execution for an accumulative structure. The cost is felt as an internal shift, an earned resolution of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict is a quiet, internal meditation rather than a struggle against external or internal opposition, which fits the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is clear and deepens as the ritual progresses. However, the pressure remains low and static throughout; there is no moment where the outcome feels genuinely uncertain or where a significant trade-off is forced, which limits the tension. The cost is conceptual and legible but lacks visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—reframing grief—is well-defined and deepens effectively. The discovery of the pulsing interface provides a meaningful point of intensification, forcing a proactive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the internal struggle against creative doubt—is signaled early and remains the clear focus. Pressure is built not through causal turns but through a steady, accumulative process, which is perfectly suited to the chosen narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake—the restoration of the valley's traditions—and builds pressure through the ritual's progression toward the harvest moon's zenith. However, the conflict feels low-tension because success feels preordained; there is no moment of doubt, error, or genuine struggle to overcome. While the escalation is texturally effective, the lack of any credible risk of failure mutes the stakes' visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes—successfully sealing the starlight—are clear and personal. Under the textural lens, pressure deepens effectively through the patient, ritualistic action, culminating in a single, decisive turn when the flash-paper ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether the harvest of echoes is possible—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict is a compelling intellectual puzzle rather than an external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—to unbind the grotto's trapped sorrow—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Pressure escalates not through an antagonist but through the precise requirements of the ritual, such as the need for absolute stillness ("a whalebone reverie of stillness"). The climax is the successful transmutation, a resolution earned entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost is legible in the transformation of grief into a "song of release."

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—transforming grief—is established immediately and deepens effectively through the physical act of carving. The pressure is accumulative, culminating in the decisive choice to seal the sap, which physically and emotionally forecloses the past's raw power.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—reconciling with a past self—is established immediately and deepens effectively through the collection of regrets. The negotiation with the ghost serves as a clear tightening of pressure, forcing a trade-off between holding onto pain and gaining clarity. The resolution is driven by Mara's agency, and the cost—accepting her eroded ambitions—is made explicit and felt in her tears and her final promise.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the conceptual stake—resurrecting hope from decay—is established, the story lacks meaningful conflict or escalation. The protagonist faces no tangible opposition, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs; every attempt succeeds without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates through an accumulative process of memory and atmospheric influence, culminating in the scribe's decisive agency: choosing to inscribe the crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of lies—is clear, and the external conflict with the lock serves as a metaphorical test. The story achieves a single deepening of stakes when the seeker's goal shifts from understanding to actively salvaging truth. However, the escalation is weakened by the implausible resolution of the physical conflict, which makes the subsequent epiphany feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central conflict—preservation against the "modern tides" of oblivion—is subtle but masterfully sustained. The stakes are deepened effectively under an Accumulative lens, culminating when the decoded knowledge is revealed to be ready for sharing, not just storage. This shift from preservation to dissemination is an excellent intensification, and the cost—the "weight of centuries" and the burden of eternal vigilance—is felt and directly tied to his success.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict is a compelling, if abstract, struggle between oblivion and remembrance. The stake—the possibility of healing—is established early and deepens effectively when the traveler revives the rose, a key intensification. The final acceptance of his endless work makes the cost of this healing clear: a solitary, unending pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is established early and pursued with focus. The story achieves a meaningful escalation through textural intensification, particularly in the prince's determined, trembling efforts to build the cradle.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a strong internal stake: transforming an inherited legacy of pain into a source of healing. The pressure builds effectively under an accumulative lens, culminating in the "coin's song," which serves as the decisive deepening of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating the memories—is clear and consistently pursued. The conflict tightens effectively at the climax when the box's "ancient reluctance" manifests as a physical sticking force, providing a moment of direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story's central stake—to share light without fire—is established early and held throughout. The conflict escalates not through external opposition but through a powerful deepening of emotional cost, particularly when the sonar echoes return with "shadows of forgotten wars." This intensification forces the protagonist to press on despite the sorrow, demonstrating agency and making the final serene glow feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—understanding collective grief—is well-defined and deepens throughout the narrative. However, the conflict is conceptual and lacks immediate, tangible pressure or opposition. The resolution is achieved harmoniously without a significant trade-off or visible price paid by the protagonist, which keeps the stakes from feeling viscerally high.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring a metaphysical “shared balance”—is abstract but consistently held. Pressure builds effectively toward the key moment: the "rare silence" during the pendulum's pause functions as a meaningful tightening of opportunity. The resolution feels earned within the story's magical logic, and the cost (the endless nature of the work) is clearly established, giving the ending its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is established early and pursued relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the kingdom's survival—is established early and remains the clear focus. The conflict escalates effectively when the predictive model generates specific, high-pressure constraints (delayed thaw, silverfish). The protagonist's agency directly addresses these threats, leading to an earned resolution where the cost is the risk and effort of an unprecedented plan.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—overcoming the city's "story famine"—is clearly established. However, the conflict is frictionless. Mara faces no significant obstacles, risks, or setbacks in her quest to transcribe and share the music. The resolution feels preordained rather than won, as the declared stakes are never truly tested by opposing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a potent, non-traditional conflict: the protagonist versus the ephemeral nature of emotion itself. The dominant stake—crystallizing a feeling—is clear from the start. Pressure escalates through a palpable deepening of atmospheric and ritualistic intensity, culminating in a decisive act where the cost of success is the loss of the "mirage of safety."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, potent internal stake early: how the past will be remembered, which dictates the future. The pressure deepens effectively when the cog's rhythm suggests a synthesis is possible, forcing the protagonist to abandon their initial binary conflict. The resolution is driven by the protagonist's intellectual agency, and the cost—relinquishing the certainty of a single championed narrative—is legible and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—healing division through art—is clear and established early. The story shows a meaningful deepening when the townspeople's tension loosens. However, the resolution feels too swift and frictionless; the "hatred that had once bound them like iron chains rusting away" dissolves with a single performance, lowering the sense of earnedness and the scale of the cost paid for such a significant change.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—creating beauty from ruin—is signaled early and pursued relentlessly. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict intensifies effectively through the stages of the ritual, culminating in the celestial alignment. The key "tightening" occurs when Mara commits the seed to the memory-broth, a point of no return.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: Mara’s internal quest to restore wonder. The pressure escalates when she acts on the secret of the box, a choice that meaningfully deepens the conflict from passive sorrow to active hope. While the resolution is driven by her agency, the external pressure is low, and the final cost is a recontextualization of past loss rather than a new, tangible price paid in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and sanctifying—is established early, and the conflict deepens effectively as the "hush" radiates and transforms the neighborhood. The protagonist shows agency in initiating this process. The primary flaw is that the resolution is achieved without a meaningful trade-off or on-page consequence; the stakes are resolved too neatly, lacking the friction of a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—Nuance versus Certainty—is effectively dramatized and escalated. Pressure deepens as the statue's influence spreads, with the shift from rigid silence to a "thrumming with possibilities" marking a clear and earned intensification. The final state of the garden makes the stakes and their resolution feel tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is primarily conceptual but escalates effectively. The story features a single, powerful deepening when Aric redefines the problem, shifting from overcoming the flaw to integrating it.

The stakes are abstract but consistently held and powerfully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether a quiet act of kindness can bridge the chasm of urban anonymity—is established early and well-defined. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal (hope vs. indifference). Jiro's arrival and subsequent memory provide the necessary deepening, confirming the stakes and proving Mara's efforts are not in vain. The cost is her exhaustion and solitude, which makes the resolution feel earned, though the external pressure remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—cultural amnesia versus the struggle to remember—is well-defined and sustained. Pressure escalates effectively through the accumulation of silence and sorrow, culminating in Liora's decisive action.

The cost is felt emotionally, making the stakes resonant and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—activating the impossible mechanism—is signaled early and pursued with clear agency. The conflict escalates logically as the clock maker combines the yoyo's cipher with the hunger stone's power, creating a meaningful tightening of pressure. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("step beyond fate's design"), and the resolution lacks a clearly dramatized or felt cost, which lessens the impact of the protagonist's victory.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—to unbosom fear—is clear and receives a meaningful deepening when Mara turns the curse back on itself. The conflict escalates effectively through atmospheric intensification. The final bargain makes the ultimate cost of success explicit and personal, providing a strong sense of consequence that forecloses the possibility of a simple victory.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that obstacles can become instruments—is philosophical and consistently maintained. The conflict escalates effectively for a textural piece, with the changing clouds prompting a "deeper dub" and a "finale," which constitutes a meaningful deepening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes conflict—the city’s potential extinction—and escalates it effectively through a single, meaningful deepening of knowledge at the mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—rescuing truth from a noble lie—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating as Arlen moves from theoretical understanding to direct confrontation with the letter's contents. The deepening of his understanding serves as the key turn. However, the resolution feels too smooth; the noble lie dissolves "not as a betrayal but as a transformation," which somewhat mitigates the sense of a difficult price being paid for the reclaimed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central conflict—Mara’s personal rebellion against oblivion—is established early and deepened effectively. The stake, preserving memory, is intangible but made concrete through her ritualistic actions.

The story demonstrates a strong command of a quiet, internal conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    The primary stake—tracing honest origins—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation or opposition. Mara formulates a hypothesis and is proven right; she presents her findings and is immediately supported. There is no significant pressure, reversal, or cost associated with her quest, making the resolution feel preordained and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—the processing of grief—is internal yet carries immense weight, intensified effectively through the ritual's progression. Escalation works as a deepening of the "luminous torment" rather than a narrowing of external options, which is perfectly suited to the accumulative lens. The story culminates in a choice to complete the process, with the cost being the painful, relived memories required to achieve a temporary, hard-won peace.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a purpose beyond grief—is clear and compelling. The pressure escalates as the protagonist moves from observation to direct interaction with the "unused pool," a choice that forecloses his previous state of being. The cost is a profound and permanent transformation, making the resolution feel earned within the story's metaphysical framework.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=2.1)
    This is the story's most significant failure; there is a near-total absence of conflict, stakes, or escalation. The goal is achieved via a simple, unopposed procedure. The stakes—"missing pieces scattered through time"—are cosmic and abstract, with no tangible, on-page consequences for failure. Without pressure, obstacles, or a meaningful test of Lira's capabilities, the narrative reads as a placid demonstration rather than a compelling story.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—quelling the protagonist's conscience—is signaled early and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the journey to the shore and the sifting of memories serves as a meaningful deepening of the conflict, forcing a direct confrontation. The protagonist’s agency in undertaking the journey leads directly to the resolution, and the cost of this confrontation is felt, foreclosing his past of deceit.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving a peaceful exchange to redeem a past failure—is established early and remains central. The pressure is primarily atmospheric and internal, deepening effectively when the protagonist offers the box, a choice that makes him vulnerable and alters the dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming the paralysis of regret—is established early and tested throughout the journey. Within the Accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies effectively as the physical act of paddling forces a confrontation with his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's quest for empathy and redemption—is established early. Pressure deepens effectively, moving from the abstract concept of choice (the baseball) to a direct confrontation with the self (the mirror). While the external conflict is minimal, the internal journey features a meaningful deepening that forces a final stance crystallization, with the cost of accepting the past made legible in the end.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond with Arion—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure escalates effectively through the sensory intensification of the ritual. The final transformation pays a clear price, foreclosing Liora's purely human form. The score is capped because the internal conflict lacks teeth; the stated reluctance doesn't generate significant on-page friction or force a difficult trade-off, making the protagonist's journey feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake is signaled early and deepens effectively through the protagonist's agency. Her actions (unfastening, whispering) intensify the problem before resolving it, a perfect escalation for the chosen lens. The resolution is earned at a visible cost, foreclosing a path of personal grief.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming universal grief by opening a new dimension—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which is appropriate for the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—understanding transformation—is abstract and internal, and the pressure remains largely atmospheric. The key turning point, the fisherman's arrival, feels like an external gift of information rather than an earned escalation driven by Mara's agency. While the story deepens its theme, it lacks a meaningful tightening of stakes or a choice that carries a visible, felt cost, making the conflict feel low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—sparking a revolution of ideas without violence—is compelling and well-defined. The pressure of the blackout provides a coherent constraint. However, the escalation feels more like a puzzle being solved than a heightening of stakes with tangible risk; the garrison’s turn is presented as an inevitable, frictionless outcome of the cradle's activation, which lessens the feeling of a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a potent internal conflict—fear of a fixed future versus the drive to shape it—and escalates it toward a single, decisive action. Placing the final stone is a point of no return that pays off the setup with a visible cost: her curse is not removed but transformed into a continuous, weighty responsibility. The stakes feel both cosmic and deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are primarily internal and conceptual—the rarefying of collective sorrow—which are effectively externalized by the storm and the ticking timer. The pressure deepens as the timer counts down, leading to a clear climactic moment. The protagonist's agency drives the ritual, and the cost is the successful transformation of overwhelming pain into navigable reverence. The conflict is coherent and well-managed for this textural piece.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict is abstract but coherent, escalating texturally rather than through traditional plot reversals. The stakes—turning questions into destinations—are consistently held, and the duel provides a clear intensification culminating in the final move. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which fits the story's philosophical aims, but this abstraction keeps the felt pressure from reaching its highest potential.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—creation against chaos—is clear and compelling. The stake is effectively established and deepened as the solitary act of rebuilding attracts a community. While lacking a traditional antagonist, the pressure of the "shattered world" is coherent, and the escalation is felt through the growing scale of the rebellion, culminating in an earned resolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict succeeds by intensifying pressure through atmospheric and temporal constraints consistent with an Accumulative lens. The stakes—defying fate—are established early and tested by a clear deadline ("until the horizon invites night") and environmental opposition ("the tide of clouds swelled... to seal him away"). The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the cost is made palpable in the final, lonely bow to his own echo.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—awakening the seed before the monsoon—is established early and held under consistent pressure. The escalation is a superb example of internal deepening appropriate for the lens, where doubt is converted into resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—releasing the island's sorrow—is signaled early and remains the clear focus. Under an Accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively as the ritual progresses, with the compass's response marking a clear intensification of pressure.

    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of overcoming fear escalates through a meaningful deepening in decoding the notes, narrowing options with the lever's threat and forcing stance crystallization at the vial's price. One visible cost—the betrayal confession—charges the ending, but pressure feels more symbolic than visceral, with coincidence in the shell's appearance complicating without fully resolving. Agency via adaptive outwitting drives the turn, yet stakes remain somewhat abstract in the mythic leviathan fragment.

    Dominant stake—turn pain into beauty—stays coherent, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical. One tightening: postcard blooms and sea pauses. Cost is conceptual (eternal caretaking) yet never manifests as a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore trust after silence”—is signaled early and tightens via each decoded glyph. One meaningful deepening: the knot-glyph’s release narrows options by binding her to perpetual guardianship. Cost is legible in the final pledge. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harmonize preservation vs. progress—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened once: the chain’s binary pulses force a single calibrated water flow that forecloses both extremes. Escalation is accumulative: each tremor, pulse, and refracted letter deepens the cost of imbalance. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and geological.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the echo of lost songs”—is signaled early and escalates through each flight; the cost is the slivering of the meteorite and the irreversible dispersal of its song. One meaningful deepening: from attic isolation to city-wide chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—guardianship of thresholds—emerges late but is signaled by the mother’s earlier lesson. Pressure deepens through sensory density rather than causal reversals; the corridor reveal tightens options once. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence) rather than visceral, yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened by the dawn deadline. Pressure escalates through accumulating luminous layers rather than causal reversals; the final fade-out crystallizes the cost of transience. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, aligning) rather than decisive, but the stance crystallizes with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightened by each seed’s conjecture. Escalation is Accumulative: hues accumulate until the mosaic reweights the stake. The final seed’s placement is a decisive act that forecloses the option of leaving the rift open. Cost is visible in the rose-colored sigh and the perpetual wandering that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving order can bloom from chaos—tightens when the ink forms an X that dictates the improvised song. The cost is the erasure of that fragile order by the tide, a felt forfeiture that narrows future possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—crafting the unfading verse—tightens when the moonstone speck melts into glowing ink; the act forecloses pure solitude, yet the cost (exile transmuted into universal conduit) is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden worth—drives escalation toward renunciation without an explicit antagonist. Cost is felt in page-space cost of refracted wasted light and clothed nets; single tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal hope—is signaled early and escalates through each trial balloon; the festival proposal tightens options by making the sky a living ledger. Cost is visible in the council’s initial unsettled reaction, though the personal price to Arin remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover what walls dream—escalates through each film-guided probe; pressure tightens when the corridor exhales thunder, forcing Lira to decide whether to keep the dream private or share it. Agency is renunciation: she accepts communal stewardship, paying with the personal weight of history. Cost is felt in the ash-warm spine.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes—“persuade mirrors to show possibilities”—are signaled early and tighten as the hush thins. Pressure is atmospheric rather than causal; the bell’s toll releases the vision but does not force a trade-off, so escalation feels gentle, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the clans lay down swords?”—is signaled early and tightened once when the first chieftain steps forward. The cost is visible in the blades surrendered and Lira’s tear. No false reversals; pressure accretes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will he preserve the bird’s echo at the price of engineered drought. Single escalation: the wind’s pause sharpens the moment to crack or relent, tightening option space. Agency stays his each step; resonance lands the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—break the city’s lullaby—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each untangled thread adds sonic density until the chorus erupts. Cost is conceptual—her own disappearance—felt in the final image. Agency is continuous; each loosened filament is a deliberate act that narrows her remaining anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether stories can be told without exploitation—surfaces early and tightens once when Selene reimagines puppet strings as lifelines. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the pressure deepens but never truly threatens her, so escalation feels cerebral rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and escalates through each loop of rope; the act of re-weaving narrows options (rope must be sacrificed to its new pattern) and exacts the cost of perpetual vigilance. Agency remains with Mara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—tightens through dream-interpretation and the seal’s activation; the storm’s approach supplies coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vortex lifts the seal, foreclosing return to stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (cosmic promise for people) narrows when numbers + sky alignment force irrevocable pact. Cost felt in visible violet light-bride—qualifying tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—release resentment—signaled early; pressure tightens as each monk’s touch forecloses the option of clinging to grudges. Agency is mostly Mara’s, but the monks’ collective thaw lacks individual cost; the wanderer finally pays with his kneel and promise. Escalation is steady but gentle, fitting the pacifist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“recapture the dream”—holds throughout; pressure intensifies via each breath-synched beat, culminating in the renunciation to stand guard rather than leave. Cost (anchored feet, eternal promise) is legible on page under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—mending generational rupture—tightens when the ribbon snag triggers the quartz repair plan. One clear escalation beat suffices; the chime’s resonance marks the irreversible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—inherit nonlinear knowledge—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: surrender linear life to receive map. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible forfeiture on page. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“save knowledge never learned”—is signaled early and escalates through each discovered void; the tightening is intellectual rather than visceral. The final act of recording the portal’s coordinates in the diary forecloses Selene’s return path, but the price is more conceptual than palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering verses to reach the garden—is signaled early and tightened once when the ink river demands a dive. Cost is visible (immersion in centuries of solace), though escalation is single-note rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stake of rendering absence legible is signaled early; pattern pressure tightens as each re-weave chimes. Yet the tightening remains cumulative rather than forcing a decisive trade-off; no on-page loss (of the seal, rope, or opportunity) beyond the abstract “door gone—time stilled.” Missing a visceral narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—restoration of cavern calm—signaled early and escalates through amplified auroras, then one clear tightening as the stone is set. Escalation is purely reactive; protagonistic agency is mostly receptive, not a trade-off that narrows other viable paths. Cost arrives as aftermath rather than decision consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences carry meaning—tightens through the prism alignment beat, narrowing options to one precise star path. Cost is visible (custodian’s solitary vigil amplified by travelers’ arrival), yet escalation is single-arc rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping collective memory—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: shadow length aligns with crystal’s strongest whisper, tightening the ritual’s stakes. Cost is conceptual (endless archival duty) rather than visceral, but legible in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—escalates through each spark that completes the mosaic note. One decisive intensification: the burst that reveals the glowing tile, narrowing options to perpetual return.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the texture of the pause between rival clans—is signaled early and tightened through sensory accumulation rather than overt confrontation. Agency is the chronicler’s attention itself, which forecloses the path of prophecy in favor of witnessing; the cost is the surrender of predictive authority. Pressure deepens via pattern rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collect pure flavors of silence—signaled early. Escalation: each filament risks contamination unless exposure is limited to one breath, tightening tactics. Hourglass of inverted gravity forces decisive micro-choices. Cost paid in the vanishing filaments and the irreversible warmth of the doll.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—delivering calm—is signaled early and deepened by the vial’s amber-to-silver turn. Escalation is tonal, not causal: pressure rises via imagery rather than narrowed options. No visible price is exacted from Lira, so the tightening feels gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stakes—“find the stair before sunrise”—compress options with each exfoliated layer. One clear tightening: mural sigil narrows infinite orchard paths to a single fissure. Cost is paid in seized time and ascending memories tugging sleeves, but sunrise also hard-boils into immediate digital gold code, shrinking every beat to a terminal cadence. Causal lens grants sufficient agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—darkness must learn to breathe—tightens by image accumulation: each tap shrinks retreat, burned bridges erase return. The decisive turn is crossing the threshold without the ring; cost is etched on the page in “loaded quiet, dense with the breath of countless unseen eyes”. Pressure grows continuously and forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate pressure into diamonds without repeating pyramid betrayal—escalates via mushroom pulse and glitch texts. One decisive tightening: securing the bolt crystallizes both diamonds and moral stance. Cost is legible in the conditional endurance of the gems.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth retrieval versus risk of shame—signaled early and tightened through audible pattern search; one deepening beat at floorboard lifts and closure. Escalation flows under Accumulative pattern: each vibration layer reweights knowledge cost until scroll is inevitable. No coincidence resolution; protagonist agency drives every step.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is early and clear. Escalation arrives as density tightening: every motif (moss, script, chorus) increases physical-ethical pressure until armor dissolves. One felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring forgotten children—tightens once when the supervisor agrees to display the button, foreclosing the option of continued neglect. The escalation is driven by Amelia’s curated evidence, not coincidence. Cost is present but diffuse: institutional change rather than personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—broadcast truth against indifference—tightens once when Mara commits to the key-turn; cost is the regime’s inevitable reprisal, sensed but not yet enacted, satisfying the single intensification rule under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent firestorm via coded prophecy—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each whispered note tightens the hush until the code unspools. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the saxophonist’s perpetual exile into fog. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the forest’s message—is signaled early and tightens once when the first leaf ignites the dust, forcing Lira to seek the underground spring. Escalation is Accumulative: each monument and reading increases the grove’s claim on her. The cost is present (bodily transformation, irreversible sync) but could be more viscerally foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten once: the compass cannot lie, so the act of following it either leads to revelation or abandonment—and every yard deeper is irreversible. Cost is clear: the greenhouse and her old repair ethos are left behind; she returns carrying ember, not gears.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the coin and her own fragmented identity—is signaled early and tightened through each calibrated action. One meaningful deepening: the crack widens only after the dragon’s name is spoken, forcing a live trade-off between perfect repair and irreversible self-imprint. Cost is visible in the cooled seam that now anchors her future obligations.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—turn grief into mirth—is signaled early and tightened when Mara risks her own ache to release the joke. One clear escalation: the joke’s burst forces the luminous laughter that reconfigures the gorge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a calculable mercy via own remembered pain—starts early and tightens through each violet flash. Each revelation demands payment of searing light: a visible cost that raises price under the Accumulative lens. The meaningful pressure deepening is the acceptance that mercy equals remembering pain instead of erasing it; this crystallizes in the climactic equation and the forest’s withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—honoring histories via fragment—reiterates early and tightens once the paintings converge. Escalation achieved through density increase and cadence shift under Accumulative lens; cost is lens fragment’s dissolution. No further reversals; single meaningful deepening sufficient. Agency is perceptual, framed as translation act rather than combative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover what ceilings hide—tightens via dust-pattern analysis and spectral tug. One decisive deepening: the attic diagram reveals the alcove, foreclosing ignorance. Cost is felt in the ledger’s brittle pages and the ghosts’ chorus. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake crystallizes quickly: destabilizing a “perfect system.” Mara’s agency drives escalation via frost-spiral press run, which triggers the rupture. Tight enough at short length.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether the shard will heal or fracture the community—tightens once when the mirrored rain transforms dispute into collaboration. Cost is visible: Lira’s private shard and the elders’ surrendered certainties.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“light stolen by midnight”—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking tower; Alder’s agency drives the repair. Yet the cost is more luminous than visceral, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the place where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightened when the compass steadies in the vortex. Escalation is Accumulative: each psychometric pulse and water-glow deepens the cost of knowing. Final surrender forecloses further pursuit with felt conceptual price. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: turn raw storm-arch into vessel for communal memory. Escalation is accretive: each lantern projection tightens the weave until tableau choice forecloses solitary sculpture path. Cost is conceptual—shared stories over lone authorship—but could be more viscerally felt. Agency remains Mira’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled early and tightens once through the prism vision; the cost is the surrender of her lingering winter. Agency is present but the tightening beat is more perceptual than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—liberate erased histories—is signaled early and tightened through each beat: parley, debris cipher, lagoon decryption. Pressure escalates via scarcity (only kelp and shells to bargain) and risk (submerged crystal). The final broadcast narrows options—Mara cannot remain neutral—yet the felt cost is more communal than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—revive the town via memory—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accumulating recollection; each remembered name/song tightens the weave. The tightening is a deepening, not a reversal, but the cost (lifelong vigilance) is felt. Agency is interior; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the preservation of emotional signature versus the tower’s inevitable fall—is clear early. Escalation arrives as the prophecy naming the future archivist tightens the responsibility loop, but agency remains cerebral, never forcing a visible trade-off on Harel. Conflict stays elegantly internal, yet lacks a palpable, page-level price outside the conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reopen the covenant—signaled in paragraph two. One decisive intensification: the spiral bursts outward, scattering shards of time that settle on the phoenix’s wings, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the “cool imprint” left on Mira’s cheek and her whispered surrender to borrowed time. Agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“favor listening over noise”—is signaled early and tightened through the sensor calibration; the zero-hour microclimate surge forces the first true test, narrowing options and exacting the cost of relinquishing the old mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: honoring fallen stars through empathic witness. Pressure deepens via accumulating star-paths and the tremor-response that ratifies the vow. One meaningful tightening—vow crystallizes stillness into duty. Cost is the perpetual night-watch; felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve silence—tightens once: the realization that breaking the covenant would “unleash a scream louder than any wind” forces the choice to endure muteness. Cost is visible in the amber tear that burns the earth. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the capsule’s purpose before the valley’s “last grain”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the urn fragment clicks and the map unfurls, foreclosing Mara’s solitude and charging the villagers with shared custodianship. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than personal injury, but still legible. Agency remains active throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing wind and water through verse—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each stanza thickens the “woven dawns” motif until the surface stills. No visible price is paid; the conflict remains aesthetic rather than urgent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the feather settles, but agency is observational.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: use the countdown as leverage to renegotiate humanity’s relation with the non-human. Tightening occurs as each copper beat makes the orchard an organism that annuls the death sentence. External cost: six months of time; internal cost: perpetual caretaking as orchard conduit. Agency remains active until the last paragraph’s hush when breathing island refutes expiration.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—will Arin choose inquiry over awe—is signaled early and tightened when the alien echo matches the amber’s signature, forcing his reciprocal experiment. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer increases density until the tower breathes. The cost is the amber’s spent glow and the irreversible shift from passive reception to active dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—garden reclaiming battlefield—tightens once when coachman must trust birds to carry pollen; no further escalation, but single deepening suffices. Cost legible in emptied seed cache and irrevocable reef death.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—binding the living to the dead—is signaled early and escalates through each color-revelation. The final tightening occurs when Rook lifts the leaf and the voices flood in, foreclosing his retirement; the cost is the lifelong burden of carrying those voices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating loss toward meaning—is signaled early and tightens through the single beat of aligning compass and constellation; the cost is the irreversible recognition that “true north had shifted but remained true,” foreclosing nostalgic stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—undo the frost-curse—tightens via each swapped chess piece; final queen-for-king exchange forecloses retreat and triggers the thaw. Cost is conceptual (eternal amendment duty) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased gestures—tightens as each missing pawn’s absence becomes luminous. One meaningful deepening: the scroll’s revelation that small acts saved lives reweights the flood’s legacy. Cost is conceptual but legible; agency is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens when the stone’s corridor appears; the final reconfiguration forecloses reliance on nightly substitution. Cost is legible in the mountain’s slowing heartbeat and Lira’s acceptance of daylight silence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each corridor turn; the pawn-sacrifice memory escalates regret until the final renunciation. Cost is legible but abstract; a sharper physical forfeiture would have lifted it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“forgiveness has a price”—is signaled early and tightened through each refracted echo. The deepening is the townsfolk’s growing participation; the cost is the collective humility paid in shared memory. Agency is diffuse; Mara’s personal price is under-dramatized, preventing higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory pressure (acid, ticking gears). One meaningful deepening: the alchemist’s surrender to narrative as repair forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the acid sea’s momentary ceasefire. Agency is narrative rather than physical, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—keeping the secret of temporary eternity—tightens once when the key is found; the cost is felt in the renunciation of sharing, though pressure is more lyrical than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled early and tested by the fisherman’s compass tug. Escalation is accretive: each pulse of intent tightens the weave of scent and light until the beam answers. Cost is visible in the emptied vial and the silent scream of love she must bear alone. One meaningful tightening suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mapping loss via reverse migration—is signaled early and tightens through each midnight call. One meaningful deepening: the engine’s roar on full moon forecloses retreat, crystallizing the stance. Cost is visible in the censer’s bruised dimming and etched names. Agency remains with the navigator; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—turning private grief into shared spectacle—tightens once when Mara seals the eye; the smugglers’ greed is checked by their own reflection. One meaningful deepening, cost legible in their silence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: give voice to a ghost memory while reconciling his own isolation. Pressure tightens as gaps reveal lyrical “cost lines” and climaxes when he aligns bloom to longest tide-lull. The invisible stranger offers no push-back—conflict is internal—but agency carries.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling the promise by finding the doorway—is signaled early and tightened when Elian places the chip. The creek’s rising acts as a cadence shift, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—end the recurring dreams—is signaled early and tightened when the map appears. One meaningful deepening: the dream is not curse but map. Cost is felt in the orb’s dissolution and her solitary vigil, though external pressure remains largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes—“will the glow anchor or dissipate?”—escalate only once when the shell ignites. The vow to guide travelers is communal, not personally costly; no single character’s option is foreclosed. Pressure is gentle, fitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: converting dreaming chaos into publishable story before life deletes the chapters. One deepening beat forces the realization that nostalgia cannot be captured without dissolving it. Cost is legible: each dream harvest of the fox of mist carries the felt loss of innocence. Tightening occurs when jealousy turns instrumentally into ink rather than mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into healing stories—is signaled early and tightened through ritual escalation. Each beat (dip quill, crystal flare, mist release) narrows options until the scars glow as runes. Agency is Lira’s throughout; coincidence absent. Cost is felt in the feather’s loss and the irreversible glow. Slight reserve: the pressure curve is more accumulative than sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before trees fall—is signaled early; orchard clock tightens atmosphere but never alters tactical options on page. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; no visible price paid until conceptual cost at end. Single deepening when apology sheet descends; no reversal. Agency is ritual, not strategic; escalation is lyrical density, not option reduction. Sufficient for short lyric mode but thin for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure rises texturally—silence intensifies, glyphs spiral, illusions tighten—tying every escalation to the witness’s stance; one meaningful intensification sufficient for this length, but protagonist agency is slightly diffused in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to understand what clocks really measure”—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual of backward counting until the zero-moment reweights knowledge. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is conceptual (abandoning quantification for intuition) and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—secure the farm from unseen intrusion—tightens as the storm test imperils water seepage; the permeable-barrier flex and laser mapping force immediate adaptation. Cost legibility felt in the post-dawn pocketed click’s forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—embracing chance without self-destruction—is signaled early and tightened when Mara risks the unknown stairwell. The cost is felt in the ledger’s new theorem, which accepts her mother’s death as unrecoverable loss. Escalation is single-track but sufficient for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—teaching endings to begin—is clear; pressure coils tighter with each recorded fragment until the last whispered “Thank you” crystallizes cost under Mara's agency. One coherent escalation is sufficient for this word count, though the legible price leans conceptual rather visceral, keeping it shy of the higher band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving small memories via the covenant—is signaled early and deepened through the archivist’s writing ritual. Pressure tightens once: the turning tide physically encroaches, forcing the ledger shut and sealing the renewal. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete; no tool, stamina, or social credit is visibly lost. Sufficient for the length, but the escalation is more cadence than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: “cure for loneliness.” Escalation is a single, deepening arc of cuts revealing the stone and the communal chime, each slice tightening the task and charging the final reciprocity ripple. Pressure coheres; no reversals or coincidences dilute the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—navigate uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and tightened by each musical note that narrows the path. The final pause of constellations forces the decisive step; cost is the surrender of external mapping. Escalation is textural: density of sensation replaces causal reversals, coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the failed experiment—tightens once via the pen’s rewrite; cost is visible in the lingering anomaly echo. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—turning silence into music—tightens as each silent beat risks permanent erasure of self. One meaningful deepening: the moment Arlen lowers the camera and disappears, trading presence for legacy. Cost is conceptual (oblivion) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—redeem fire into preservation—tightens once when the tapestry completes the phoenix image and the bronze box demands a choice. Cost is visible: he forfeits anonymity and former identity to become guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—turn sterile observation into shared dream—tightens through escalating drumbeats that force the staff’s dream-intrusion. One clear intensification suffices; coincidence is avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outlast shouts—tightens once when the radio repeats the phrase. Cost is conceptual (the city’s hidden dialogues re-stitched) but less viscerally felt than required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes—“teach darkness the value of stars”—are declared early but never tested or tightened. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; the weave proceeds unopposed. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. guardianship—tightens when the whale’s call forces Mara to choose between keeping the scrimshaw or releasing it. The cost (loss of talisman, internalized island heart) is legible, though escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—can Mara carve a permissible space for grief inside mandated joy?—is clear early. Pressure is situational and static: the mandate looms, but no beat narrows her options or raises the price of discovery; repetition replaces escalation. The climax reconfigures meaning rather than risk, so the conflict plateaus mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—dissolving boundaries—tightens via the poet’s paraphrase act and the colonnade’s chromatic response. One meaningful intensification; cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—trading awakenings to complete her palette—tightens with each barter; the final ivy-lotus union forecloses further trades. Escalation is accumulative: each hue costs sunrise pigment, narrowing resources. No external antagonist; pressure arises from Selene’s own flawed bargain. Cost is visible: wilted rosemary beside thriving cactus literalizes the price.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—awakening kinship in the artificial mind—escalates through successive chimes that map new synaptic sparks. The tightening is textural rather than causal, and the cost is conceptual (isolation dissolved) rather than visibly paid by the bell-ringer.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether grief can be alchemized into guidance—tightens through each crane’s deployment; the silver thread literalizes narrowing options. Cost is felt in the perpetual duty she accepts, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—mapping hope from collapse—is signaled early and tightens through each measured loop. The final spiral’s break-point offers a visible narrowing of options, though the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unlock forbidden knowledge—tightens once: the historian must abandon rhythmic certainty to reach the prism. The cost is visceral (anguished joy, tears) and alters his future path. Escalation is driven by his agency under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope via recorded memory—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: the mirrored footage tightens the pattern, forcing the act of recording his own hands. Cost is conceptual (loss of anonymity, luminous regret) and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing trust after betrayal—tightens once: each layer shed narrows options until only honest return of the tail-tip remains. Pressure grows via Accumulative density, not causal turns; cost is the exposure of Mara’s complicity. No coincidence resolves; agency is hers.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“learn to read scars”—is signaled early and tightened once when the moss demands the protagonist’s own scar pattern. Agency is present (alignment ritual) but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; tension rises through textured accumulation rather than a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—locating and freeing unused love—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via psychometric visions and the glowing map, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. The final release feels inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped creativity—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each traced star thickens the unheard chorus, tightening the dreamer's exhaustion. Cost is diffuse—fatigue rather than irreversible forfeiture—so pressure feels moderate. Agency resides in endurance, not decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks to regrow forests—is signaled early and tightened once: the reverse tick of the clock forecloses stasis. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the visible cost (guard’s dreamless state, physical toll) is implied rather than dramatized on the page. Escalation is single, decisive, and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the wild frontier of mind—is signaled early and tightened once when the gear’s insertion awakens the engine, foreclosing the option of remaining unchanged. Cost is conceptual (perceptual expansion) rather than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding dormant courage—is signaled early and tightened when the map offers literal paths to it. Escalation is textural: each indirect route adds weight until the cave reconfigures options. Cost is conceptual (facing the self) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency rests with Mira at the latch moment.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—tightens once when the discoloration answers with copper warmth. Agency is collective endurance rather than individual decision, but the price is legible and the lens-consistent escalation suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and tightens via each deciphered fragment until the final exposure strips the specter’s sovereignty. Escalation is causal and embodied: every new clue increases the titan’s agency while narrowing the impostor’s options. The price is the literal collapse of the old order, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why migration paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when the watermark matches the canyon. The tap-echo test is the single meaningful escalation that forces a stance crystallization: the ocean “speaks,” confirming the canyon’s role. Cost is conceptual (reefs’ lost compass) rather than personal, but legible. No false reversals; coincidence complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and tightened when the stone’s hum forces her from observer to catalyst. One clear escalation: dormant engines cough alive, visible cost in the dust-choked air and workers’ wary return. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will tradition evolve or ossify?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Anara must trade memory for communal future. One clear escalation: the vapor column forms only after the last rune is traced, forcing irrevocable choice. Cost (erased lullabies) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake (anchor hope while carrying grief) tightens once via the photograph-smooth ritual that re-weights the stillness concept; absence of antagonist keeps external pressure fiat-light.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can brokenness become canvas?—tightens as each card narrows options toward the necessary darkness. One decisive intensification: the slamming door seals daylight, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the “steady pulse” replacing ache.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why time slows—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each ink pattern reveals the world’s collective pause, narrowing Kael’s options to witness or warn. The cost is conceptual but legible: once seen, the pause cannot be unseen, and history can still vanish.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberation vs. peace—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the councilor “felt the tremor in his marrow.” One decisive intensification suffices; the price is the irreversible scandal and Maren’s personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—protecting the quiet hope amid ruin—is signaled early and tightened when Lira gathers the remaining scraps to reinforce the dome. One meaningful escalation: the boy’s broken compass forces her to convert a petal into a compass of purpose, foreclosing her own retreat. Cost is felt in the communal vow and the elder’s acceptance of historical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens once when the constellations tangle; the cost is the fisher’s surrender of control, visible in the spike’s celestial fire. Agency drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover the hidden ledger—tightens when the console proves the ledger exists and pinpoints its location. One meaningful turn: the cipher unravels, foreclosing denial. Cost is societal exposure, felt through the distant siren and journalist’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens once when the firmware loops collapse into the amber’s lull. Agency is renunciation: she seals the lull beneath the drawer, paying with perpetual custodianship. Cost is visible but could be sharper; the price feels communal more than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming fragmented echoes into coherent silence—is signaled early and escalates through each traced spiral. The tightening is accretive: every grain released raises the cost of further noise. Agency is present yet diffuse; the final hush arrives more as culmination than decisive act. Felt price is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes hinge on transforming civic empathy in the wake of fire; pressure is single, coherent, and escalates through the ritual act. One deepening choice (the communal treading) visibly narrows remaining options and locks in the cost. Emotional stakes are palpable, though political stakes stay poetic rather than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—a last chance to summon hope—follows escalation track: drifting curtains amplify desperation, orchard tightens via audio-compressed echoes, climax locks choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving neural resonance without drugs—tightens when each pulse risks overwriting her own markers. The deepening occurs as the geode’s feedback forces a trade-off: surrender skepticism or abandon the experiment. Cost is felt in the electric tingle that persists after the trial, though the external stakes (peer review) are off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the silent world—escalates via the heat-mapping ritual; each droplet tightens the pattern until the leaf’s glow reconfigures the cave’s silence into song. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible in the final pulse. Agency is present but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“to spin prophecy into raw possibility”—tightens when each catalogued button narrows and finally unlocks the canyon song. One clear inflection: layout of river-shaped buttons triggers irretrievable roar, with a felt price (Mara’s solitary walk on time-sand leaving familiar world behind).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake “fix the shattered trust inside me” and external stakes “reach the hidden glen” weld as interior/external mirror; the narrowing valley passage and pillbox’s final burst tighten choice under cost, clear if slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—distill memory into single stitch—tightens as ticking gutters count down; silence forces crystallization. Escalation is textural (density of fog, cessation of ticks) rather than causal, fitting the lens. Cost is conceptual: surrender of layered past for singular clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—coaxing the oasis to breathe again—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each pulse of thrum and lantern glow tightens the weave of past and present until the hive reawakens. Cost is legible in the surrender of the lantern, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—banishing dread from the harbor’s corners—escalates through textured accumulation rather than sharp reversals. Each planted vine tightens the pattern until darkness “recoils,” a meaningful intensification under the Accumulative lens. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—turning isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened once: the sundial’s placement awakens scripts, forcing Mira to accept partnership with the whale’s memory. Cost is felt in the “brittle awakenings” that risk shattering coherence. Agency is lyrical but present; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether Mira will keep or release the letters. Pressure escalates through sensory feedback—perfume, glow, hum—culminating in the spiral’s pulse. Her agency drives the climax; no coincidence resolves it. The cost is the irrevocable exposure of her ghostwritten secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing chaos sown by cosmic tricksters—is signaled early and tightened when the false solar-flare alarm is neutralized. Agency is clear: Mara’s interference rewrites the signal. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering the key—tightens when the walls literally narrow choice. Spatial mutiny escalates via the compass’s activation, forcing a trade-off between personal relief and legacy. Cost is visible: the explorer’s claustrophobia never fully abates, lingering as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—bringing forgotten victims back into communal memory—is signalled early and gains density through each recovered name. Quarry itself supplies the final twist (crack reveals carvings) which counts as Accumulative/Textural deepening. No visible price paid by Mara herself, limiting escalation score to mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the ancestor’s story—escalates from cataloguing to sealing the nail in concrete; the storm’s low-pressure vortex is coherent pressure, not deus ex machina. Cost is visible: the nail is now literally immobile, foreclosing future retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake – deliver bridge-song to activate amnesty – is signalled early and intensifies toward summit. One decisive tightening: glass-flake trembles to capture the moment. Cost visible (exposure, literal light), yet escalation feels gentle for publish-now tier.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—how to guide wanderers without trapping them—tightens when Maya’s push for expansion meets Arlen’s boundary ethic; the crash crystallizes the cost, forcing Arlen’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Central stake is the decoding of shared burdens; tension mounts as glyphs align with star pulses. Pressure intensifies when each star-pulse is read as an actual navigational cue toward temple entry, narrowing escape routes to “share or fail”. Cost is the implicit open-ended stewardship: eternal decoding vigil, crystallized—tangible, visible on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unbend the frozen confession—is signaled early and tightened through each expanding circle; the cost is the seed’s redirected hunger and the orchard’s transformed stance. One decisive intensification suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“bind dream to duty”—is signaled early and escalates through hedge-scar mapping and portal opening. One meaningful tightening: maze parts only after visionary accepts collective longing. Cost is present but diffuse; stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—filling her inner void by bartering futures—tightens when the amber thread visibly binds both giver and receiver, foreclosing pure self-repair. One clear escalation beat: the root’s shiver after the soot seal shows cost is real and rising.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—purpose after public shame—escalates until the final re-weighing; no reversals, but the tightening beat (ledger entry) forecloses former self-image. Cost is felt, causal pressure aligns with lens. Coincidence remains inert rather than resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition—tightens when the seed’s glow forces Lira to choose between keeping the spirit or letting it go. The single meaningful turn (deciding to descend) carries felt cost (loss of arbor cradle). Pressure escalates via frequency sync, not external antagonist, fitting Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder to stalled time—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no concrete consequence of the frozen clocks is dramatized. The librarian’s agency is real (forging, sealing), yet the cost feels symbolic rather than lived. One meaningful tightening occurs when the key melts, but pressure plateaus rather than peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external force opposes Mara, so pressure is entirely internal and static. The pearl brightens, yet Mara’s options never narrow; she faces no trade-off or risk of failure. The single meaningful tightening is the lavender shift after the first confession, a textural deepening rather than a forced choice. Escalation is present under Accumulative lens but lacks a visible price that alters her tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: self-forgiveness. Escalation is textural—each graffiti line and river murmur layers pressure until the final image crystallizes the cost of chronicling regret. No external antagonist; coincidence limited to finding the poem, which complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—finding the unspoken library—is clear, but pressure plateaus after the alcove opens. Reversals are decorative (glyphs spin) rather than narrowing options. No visible price paid; the cost is poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—dream versus empire—is signaled early and tightens through the dimming promise’s glow. Escalation is textured: each coffee ring and violin note narrows options until the envoy’s stance crystallizes. Cost is the empire’s partial surrender and Elara’s personal grief. No reversal beyond the single decisive act, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“capture the last spark before oblivion”—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each brushstroke tightens the lattice until the emerald flares; the aurora’s fade is the felt cost. No external reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment via forgiveness—is signaled early; pressure deepens through ritual, yet the cost feels internal and diffuse rather than an option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the decree stay rigid?—tightens once when Mara unhooks the knot; the magistrate’s softened jaw shows the cost. Escalation is pattern-deepening rather than causal reversal, fitting Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves; agency remains Mara’s.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—learn to teach vanishing to appear—tightens once: Mira must withhold perception until the grotto grants its lesson. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses to delay sight, narrowing her options to either grasp youth or accept the paradox. Cost is felt in the final renunciation, though the escalation beat could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens through escalating sensory pressure. One meaningful tightening: the pulse aligns with birds’ spirals, crystallizing the invisible map. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of motion) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the worth of quiet brilliance—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each step up the spire intensifies the cost of hiding his glow. Final tightening occurs when he places palm to stone, foreclosing the path of anonymity; cost is the exposure of his once-derided light. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single dominant stake—discover the color of sound—is reiterated and escalated via the library’s color-beats and the binding of the sigil. The tightening occurs when Eli recognizes the visible chord; the cost is implicit but legible in the “next journey” map. No reversal beyond the chord, so escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—alignment with a dying universe’s last frequency—is signaled early and deepens through each decoded pop; the final narrowing to a single tone forces a stance crystallization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: naming fears to redeem nameless grief. Pressure tightens with each crystal consumed; options narrow as Lira’s body lightens toward dissolution. No external antagonist—conflict is internal and existential—yet each naming exacts an irreversible toll. The final aurora is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance via bell resonance—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each drip-counting beat. Escalation is Accumulative: irregular drops → steady pulse → healed rim, each stage narrowing options and raising the cost of failure. The final toll forecloses the path of silence and reopens the river. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and self-generated.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—erasing a false myth—escalates as each photograph tightens the evidentiary noose; the final communal silence is a felt price, though the beat-to-beat pressure is more accretive than sharply intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake (balance mind and heart) escalates under Causal lens: each beat tightens because starling flight narrows flame pulse, amber hiss raises visible price. One decisive intensification: shard spiral redefines stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust under pressure—escalates via tactile revision of the harness; the tightening of each loop narrows options until the radio’s single phrase crystallizes the cost. One decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore feeling vs leave the Duplicate sealed—is signaled early and tightened by the slice. Agency is Kael’s alone; the factions complicate but do not resolve. Cost is the literal breach of containment and the emotional flood that follows. One meaningful escalation: silence → blade → luminous torrent.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding imaginative space—surfaces early and tightens as each cipher unlocks literal breathing room. Yet the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no participant forfeits anything tangible, muting the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring laughter—tightens through escalating sonic attempts; each pull of the cord raises the cost of failure. The final silence after the last echo crystallizes the trade-off: joy is rekindled, but the conductor must disappear, a visible price under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—tightens via each tincture adjustment; agency is iterative and visible. One meaningful intensification: the crozier’s cold flame rewrites the night. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—merging timelines—is signaled early, but escalation lacks tightening; pressure arises from lyrical images more than lived trade-offs, and agency is narrated rather than dramatized through specific decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled early and escalates through each eruption; the final bridge forecloses passive observation. Pressure tightens once, visibly, when the thread tightens and the courtyard appears.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing a voice before oblivion—tightens through three discrete beat-level choices (scanner sync, track, whisper back). Pressure crystallizes when the protagonist renounces anonymity to bear the singer’s song, closing the path with visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover and preserve the codex’s map of invisible currents—is tested by the lethal phase transition. One tightening beat: aligning codex with console triggers dimensional fold, foreclosing retreat until return protocol is whispered. Cost is the permanent surrender of the codex.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming legal existence—tightens when each ink sigil risks overwriting her mind; the ghost’s tally halts only after she accepts the flaw as teacher, a visible price paid in cognitive exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save a dying language—tightens once when the storyteller realizes the price is eternal silence for the living. Escalation is driven by his agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“turn bitterness into a cosmic joke”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the static voice shifts from mournful to mischievous, forcing the protagonist to accept the beast’s laughter as vessel. Cost is the arrowhead’s loss and the irreversible internal echo.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure tightens from “maintain order” to “music becomes forest” via escalating statue threats; heart-driven stakes crystallize in vines breaking metal soil—an on-page tightening with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—deliver truce without interception—is signaled early and tightened when the drone approaches; the storm’s flash is the single decisive escalation that narrows options and forces retreat. Cost is the spent storm and the quiet rain that “washes away old grudges.”

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must decide to follow the staircase. Pressure grows via the intensifying fog and the train’s remembered laughter, but the final cost is more conceptual than visceral. One clear tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the palette’s light must meet sunrise in a single irreversible moment. Agency is present (Mara presses shutter), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Coincidence (Lio’s synchronous epiphany) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—signals early and tightens once: ribbon slip forecloses return of hair. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but filament linger and cosmos acceptance keep pressure intact. One meaningful deepening suffices, escalation legible under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover memories—clear from first line. One escalating beat when floodwater visibly retreats; cost translated into revealed orchard and communal chant beneath wrecks. No secondary reversal, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (restoring the library) tightens via one development moment (tea-leaf geometry reconfiguring closure timing). Missing visible resource cost at 600-word cap keeps it shy of high band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the seed cracks and luminous spores stitch bridges. Escalation is gradual, lyrical, and driven by the pruner’s tending; cost is conceptual (loss of isolation) rather than visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    One deepening escalates cleanly: each loosened knot literally compresses the silence until the last fiber becomes an umbilical cord for the mask. Cost is visible—each spirit siphons a filament of starlight—but the tightening would hit harder if net mechanics (tension, fray, time) were shown rather than narrated. Still meets single-scene pressure standards.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reopening the chapel’s silence—escalates through pattern intensification: matching raindrops across decades tightens the boundary. One meaningful deepening when glyphs appear under overlay. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the last transmission—tightens once when the final strand snaps and the captain’s love is heard. The cost is felt in Mort’s quiet gratitude and the globe’s shatter, though the escalation is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“give voice to coded ghost”—is signaled early and deepened by lightning clock. Meaningful tightening occurs when the press is re-used: fresh tulip grafted to binary plea narrows options; now the mural must sing forever. Visible cost: courtyard as perpetual archive. Agency is one-way; the ghost’s change is the payoff, not the balladeer's.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    A dominant stake—rediscovering protected joy—faces early artifact pressure that escalates: from static diary to active decryption via goggles, each beat narrows choices crystallizes risk; the mirrored ten-floor ascent both times creates clear causal tightening without reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.7)
    Loneliness rises with each cloud audit; the brass telescope itself delivers a measured deepening when inscribed feelings become the closure, but escalation arrives late and single-threaded.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capture the sky before demolition—tightens via the noon deadline; each timed pigment layer is a micro-choice under pressure. No reversal, but the deepening pattern of drying intervals narrows options until the mural’s completion becomes the irrevocable act. Cost is the loss of the library and the safe’s closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—“amplify hope across the orchards”—is abstract and never truly imperiled. Pressure rises only through poetic intensifiers (“brambled hope,” “collective sighs”) rather than narrowed options or felt cost. The bell rings exactly as foretold; no trade-off or loss is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—granting the world one breath—escalates through each revolution of the dial; the tightening is the hush thickening into a veil that forecloses further intervention. Cost is the irreversible loss of that single saved moment, felt in Elara’s vanishing footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers before frost—tightens through the ticking clock; the caretaker’s agency is renunciation rather than rescue. Cost is visible in the orchard’s shudder and the caretaker’s empty hands, though the price feels generalized rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens through each beat. Foam insight forces a narrowing of options: only the river’s lattice will work. Cost is visible in the emptied chrysalis and the spring pilgrimages she must now repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—locating narrative origin—escalates only once: the vendor’s incision releases moonlight that awakens dormant scripts. Pressure is aesthetic, not perilous; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The child’s arrival extends rather than tightens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—alleviating collective remorse—is signaled early and escalates through tactile contagion. One meaningful tightening: the act of tasting/subsuming grief narrows options to release or fracture. Cost is visible (cracking coral, dissipating storm) but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving memory across cultural fracture—is legible from first paragraph. Rising pressure gathers as elevator voices modulate languages, then as physical bridges accrue etched verses. Last paragraph crystallizes communal rather than personal risk, limiting visceral cost; nevertheless, a single decisive tightening (the dawn unison) narrows previous isolation to shared breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—becoming archaeologist of abandoned dreams—is signaled early and tightened when Aria realizes she must revive, not merely catalog. The tremor provides a visible price and risk of fracture; escalation is one clear deepening rather than multiple reversals. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake—guard forgotten combinations—escalates as time tightens to the hour of inverted gravity. The reversal itself deepens stakes by exposing glyphs; cost is visible in the seedlings Liora must now eternally tend. One meaningful tightening is elegantly achieved, no superfluous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—“discover beauty hidden in difficulty”—is signaled early, intensifies through successive celestial-board translations, and crystallizes in a final stance that forecloses immediate reunion; felt cost is exile prolonged, yet escalation remains lyrical density more than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering unheard silences—escalates through frequency alignment, a deepening rather than reversal. Pressure is coherent but diffuse; the cost is aesthetic wonder rather than a narrowed option or forfeiture. One meaningful intensification occurs when the clasp glows, yet it resolves too gently to feel like a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and revisited through scent shifts and communal breath. Escalation is textural: density of perfume, doodles, and hush intensifies until the bloom releases its truth. Yet the tightening is collective; Lira’s personal agency and visible cost remain muted, keeping pressure just below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—securing the orchard’s resilience—escalates through the ticking hour of inversion, narrowing Mira’s options to seize or surrender the tip. The cost is legible: she gives up exclusive control. A crisper articulation of what failure would have meant to her personally would have tightened the screw another notch.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—read the wind or the city stays dead—tightens decisively at the anemometer’s trembling needle and spirals into the tower sigh; no meaningful reversal, yet the pressure folds rather than resolves, satisfying the lens. Missing visceral personal loss holds it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake–certifying wonder–escalates through color-saturation density: each echo demands more luminous breath from the singer. Cost registers as audible diminishment of her stamina in “each toll a prism…split into rainbow chords,” yet the price remains poetic more than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform guardianship through failure-insight—is signaled early and tightened when the seam widens. One meaningful deepening: realization that prior keepers “clung to one path” forces her stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the sealed seam and the promise to “listen to every failure.”

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment’s crack forces Mara to accept endless disorientation as the price of knowledge. One clear deepening; cost is legible in the final cascade of light.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is to germinate wonder before mentor’s ethos fades. Pendant’s vibrations give agency; each activation tightens by using another chance. Cost is felt via pendant’s fading glow—one less miracle remains. Escalation is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is tested in a single escalating beat: prism against frost → luminous bloom → shared grief. The tightening is the irreversible fusion of traveler’s sorrow to Liora’s path, foreclosing her former skepticism. Cost is the burden of carrying that grief forward. Agency is quiet (alignment, whisper, reach) but decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—send the message across impossible distance—is signaled early and escalates through each puzzle piece’s click restoring sound. The tightening occurs when Mara places the bead on the pedestal, foreclosing her own luminosity. Cost is visible in the dimmed bead and her whispered gratitude, though the escalation is more pattern-deepening than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—signaled early; pressure tightens when memory barter is accepted, foreclosing retreat. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover and release the withheld truth—is signaled early and escalates when the log entry reveals the commander’s betrayal. One decisive tightening: Lira chooses to awaken the crew, foreclosing her ability to return unchanged. Cost is the shard’s destruction and the irreversible merging of timelines. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—protecting the anonymous letter chain—is signalled early and tightened by the dying lamp. Escalation is subtle but legible: as darkness swells, Marek’s stacking becomes the single live tactic, narrowing options to memory and weight. Cost: he shoulders custodianship rather than escape; the price is felt rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—shape a new dawn—tightens once when the accidentally prophetic symbols force immediate action; the cost is the irreversible veiling of sunrise. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—why stories magnetize—intensifies through escalating density rather than external reversals; each sun-trail flare tightens the thematic focus to a Charged Poise. Cost remains conceptual rather than embodied, but the reconfiguration is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—relieving the maze’s quantified sorrow—is signaled early and tightened once when each dream-line drawn dims the grid. Cost is visible: the sextant’s waning light and Eli’s ebbing stamina. Agency drives the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and escalates through song-fed light that thaws soil and sky.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—unearthing wisdom in past abandonment—signals early. Pressure tightens when the curator links admission of error to deeper access, but the cost remains largely conceptual; no tangible forfeiture beyond emotional recognition. One meaningful deepening, yet stakes stay interior and low-heat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the sacred from the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accumulation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the loaf is sliced and shared; the cost is the irreversible reduction to crumbs. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“to conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightened by each measured frequency; the final pulse forecloses the option of ignorance. Cost is visible in the weight settling on her shoulders and the corridor of meaning that replaces oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (keep truce until sunrise) is signaled early and tightened by the lantern heist attempt; Lila’s agency drives the decoy and blackout. Cost is present (truce momentarily broken, darkness imposed) yet not viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—decode why people carry weather—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through taste-cascade and compass flickers, but agency remains observational; no decisive trade-off or visible price is paid. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: save the city by restoring truth. Escalation is textural intensification—each aligned map fragment tightens atmospheric pressure; the vent’s roar literalizes the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—is signaled early. Escalation is tonal accumulation: wind quiets, gulls grow silent, shadows lengthen, the final beat sustains the sculpture’s slow heartbeat. Feels like tightening, though a sharper cost would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static—tightens when magnetic shift threatens the farm; Vira’s agency miniaturizes chaos, foreclosing perpetual vigilance at the cost of surrendering the box to the soil.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—“prove that listening heals”—is declared early but never tested under pressure. Escalation is textural: more names, more letters, more gratitude notes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—encode vulnerability as strength—escalates through each coded entry and dance, tightening until the dice unlock the crystal. Cost is visible: Selene relinquishes the dice and the lab itself. One clear deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—learning stone language as living heartbeat—signal appears early. Pressure tightens through the mutual revelation that lies protect truth; escalation is cadence-driven rather than plot-driven, fitting accumulative lens.

    Dominant stake—solitude re-forged into independence—is announced early and escalates via each resonance-structure recording in the ledger; a single meaningful turn occurs when silence must be surrendered to sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—learning to perceive hidden effort—escalates through pattern recognition rather than external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—will ancient shadows become scaffold for hope?—is signaled early and deepened through nightly accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—translating ancestral sound—intensifies through each jar sealed; the tightening is the irrevocable act of gifting a jar to the child, foreclosing the poet’s sole ownership. Cost is visible: he walks into the desert lighter yet lonelier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preventable deaths from seepage—tightens when the hidden conduit is traced and the valve turned, foreclosing further flooding. Escalation is single but sufficient; cost is the city’s control loosening and Mara’s own emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ring the unhearable bell—is signaled early and tightened once: the transliteration protocol converts chaos into vector, narrowing options to a single approach. Cost is conceptual (algorithmic satiation) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

    Dominant stake—recovering the lost crew’s voice—is signaled early and tightens when Lia risks network censure by seeding the lie.

    Dominant stake—reconciling past love with living terroir—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the sentinel plants the ash and feels it “seep into his own skin,” a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—is declared but never tested by an opposing force or a narrowing choice. Pressure remains atmospheric; no beat forces the Keeper to risk or forfeit anything. The conjured clearing appears as gift, not earned reversal. Cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—guiding Mr. Harlan’s final breath—is signaled early; pressure tightens once through the deliberate slowing of chords, but escalation is more cadence shift than causal narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—map the noon shadows—is signaled early and tightened when the doorway appears, foreclosing other research paths.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)

    Dominant stake—capture wonder without imprisoning its source—is signaled early and tightened once: the timer’s first shiver pulls echoes into the jar, foreclosing the option of leaving them wild. The price is the quiet, ongoing labor of tending new jars, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“to unbind the grotto’s sorrow”—is consistently signaled; pressure tightens through accumulating mineral statues.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trading regret for a glimpse of abandoned wonder—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Mara offers the camera wheel.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.3)

    Dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and tightened by each sonar ping that maps corridors and returns fragments of memory. The deepening is incremental rather than a single reversal; the cost is atmospheric rather than concrete. Agency is present but diffuse; the gear’s release is more ceremony than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the shape of intentions—tightens once the tapestry thread reveals Marlowe’s true motive. The gardener’s choice to preserve rather than expose the map narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stake—prevent famine—is clear and escalates via the three-month delay forecast. One tightening beat: the scholars’ skepticism is overturned by on-page success, but the personal price to the cartographer remains muted.

    Dominant stake—crystallize a fleeting emotion—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each powder layer and shard glimmer tightens the emotional vise until crystallization is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—grow a garden of renewal—tightens once when the seed must sprout before alignment ends. Agency is clear: Mara’s pruning and tasting drive escalation; cost is the city’s memories she must metabolize, felt in the final inhale of “old stories.”

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the key turns: the tower’s hum returns, foreclosing the option of permanent silence. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals required. The cost is conceptual (accepting the pause as echo) rather than visceral, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—“arming” the houses with hush—tightens once via the shard’s deployment; agency is gentle but present, though the visible price paid feels lightly staged rather than jeopardizing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—softening certainty with nuance—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each filament of memory adds density rather than narrowing options. A visible price is missing; the garden merely “thrummed with possibilities,” leaving cost atmospheric rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: prove perpetual motion from pure logic. Escalation is textural: each roll tightens the lattice of probability, the staircase’s quiver marks the intensification. Cost is visible—the chipped die’s refusal becomes the stabilizing flaw—yet the price feels more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—rousing strangers through art—tightens when Jiro’s remembered kindness proves the gamble worthwhile. Pressure is accretive, not causal; the courier’s pause is coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens rules.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—cultural thaw versus extinction—is signaled early and tightened when the first loaf cracks open the doors; agency is collective rather than individual, so the cost is diffuse but still legible in the shared dread that “melts like sugar.”

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate”—is signaled early and tightened when the engine coughs alive; the visible price is the hunger stone’s dimming. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early and tightened once when Mara places the clasp. The escalation is driven by symbolic pattern rather than character agency, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—turn obstacles into instruments—is signaled early and tightened through escalating dub iterations. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final cloud cascade demands a deeper dub, forcing a syncopated strike that costs the prophet his momentary communion. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent Shellhaven’s fossilization—is signaled early and escalates through pattern decoding and watcher contact. One decisive tightening: the tunnel opens only at solar zenith, forcing immediate exit. Cost is conceptual—the city’s “lost willingness to listen” is exposed—but could be more viscerally felt on Mira’s body or tools. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—tightens once when Arlen decides to display rather than conceal the letter. The cost is conceptual (loss of the protective myth) and felt in the station’s sudden warmth, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving drowned memory—tightens through each placed note; the final vow is the decisive narrowing. Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the Accumulative lens. One credible loss: the ink itself bleeds away, altering later tactics. No reversals, yet the deepening is sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving the city’s deliberate burial—tightens once when the alternative hypothesis is tested against the drowned scribe’s poetry. The cost is the city’s exposure, but it is felt more by the setting than by Mara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—fold grief into cranes—signaled at 25%. Pressure intensifies toward the moment detached shadow detaches; no false reversals. Final trade-off visible—hope ascending / past descending—creates felt cost on page. Escalation is emotional patterning, one tightening cycle adequate to lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—locating and merging with dormant potential—is signaled early; pressure deepens through successive frequency calibrations that foreclose safe retreat. One intensification suffices; cost is the blistering internal tide he must absorb alone.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightens once when the star trails force a single correct drone path. The lever-pull narrows options irreversibly; cost is the perpetual vigilance Lira accepts. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens without external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—quelling guilt by uncovering a withheld truth—is signaled early and tightened when the carvings align into a moral reckoning. Cost is conceptual (weight of truth) rather than external, satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether past error can be salvaged into a humane exchange. Stakes tighten when the rope is untethered and the pull accepted, foreclosing vengeance. Pressure remains existential credibility rather than physical peril—coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. A visible price is paid (symbolic liberation of self, practical loss of buffer rope).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether the navigator can convert regret into forward motion—is signaled early and tightened through the paddle-stroke mantra and sunrise dissolution. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when “backlash of regrets” is reframed as tide to ride; cost is the emotional labor of that reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reunion with Arion—is signaled early and tightened once: the metamorphosis exacts bodily cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals. The price is felt, though the escalation is single-note rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim lost time to heal the twins’ unborn sighs—is signaled early. Escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than tightening; pressure rises through sensory density rather than narrowing options. Cost is legible only in the cartomancer’s self-erasure at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—open the locked dimension—tightens via each shimmer-stitch; the final seam-crack is the decisive intensification. Agency is present but abstract; the pacifist constraint (no force) shapes tactics, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s quest to feel transformation—is signaled early but escalates via external spectacle rather than narrowing choices. The prophecy tightens the pattern but does not force a trade-off or visible price from Mara herself. Pressure remains atmospheric; no single beat forces a costly decision under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—silent revolution—signaled early; pressure tightens when blackout forces covert action. Escalation is one deepening: cradle activation changes knowledge state of garrison. Cost is conceptual (loss of unquestioning obedience) rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—turning curse into usable foresight—is signaled early. Escalation is a single, intensifying accumulation: each rock tightens the pattern until the violet flame seeds future bluffs. Cost is the perpetual burden of foresight and the flame’s departure. No coincidence resolves; all pressure arises from Selene’s deliberate design.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether 23 minutes can transmute collective scars into breathable wonder—tightens through each tick and thunderclap. The poet’s agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than reversal, but the cost (perpetual burden of the map) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—turning question into destination—is signaled early and reweighted at close, but escalation is more lyrical intensification than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—can beauty outlast anarchy?—is signaled early and deepens through each repaired shelf. Escalation is Accumulative: each sprout raises stakes of discovery. Cost is conceptual (perpetual exposure) rather than visceral, keeping it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—surprise fate with an unplanned encore—is signaled early and tightened by the horizon’s nightfall deadline. Escalation is textural: each compass pulse and reel splice intensifies the density rather than causal reversals. The cost is the arbor sealing him away, yet the escape feels pre-ordained by his “strategically creative” label, blunting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—awaken the seed before monsoon—tightens via each symbolic mapping; the sprout forecloses failure but the price (fragile shoots vs. storm) is more forecast than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single, steadily intensifying stake—diffuse the lingering sorrow—tightens each time the tutor’s knot-tying inches the compass needle; no spurious coincidences and the resolution hinges on his last whispered instruction rather than fate. The cost (personal cerulean regret released) is visible and felt in the final hue shift across the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (microscopic patterns preprocessing reality) tightens via Mara's agency: humidity observations prove dust alters environment. Cost is conceptual—abandoning supernova-scale drama for "garden ghosts"—felt in the final pulse of change beneath her boots.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when frost melts to reveal the path, narrowing options to one hidden route. Cost (fire's destruction) is visible early but lacks visceral felt weight in climax; "purpose" realization feels earned yet slightly abstract without tangible physical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Mara's agency as heat-mapping deepens emotional stakes ("crimson for fear, azure for longing"), narrowing options to vulnerability with visible cost in "smoothing jagged memory into calm line".

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake (rest for the dead) tightens through light pulses that transform spirits' state, but escalation relies more on environmental accumulation than Marlow's agency. Cost is visible (his vanishing) yet one concrete trade-off during reassembly would deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (feeding community) signaled early but never intensify; sanctions pressure stays static. No narrowing of options or visible cost escalation—volunteers succeed repeatedly without complication. "Amplified quiet" concept deepens theme but fails to test Mara's resolve under mounting risk.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen through breathing rhythm (agency-driven escalation), but dominant stake ("free unused love") remains abstractly resolved; visible cost (tear dimming) lacks emotional weight to fully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (dissolving perception to reveal time's texture) remains abstract; no visceral escalation as photograph dissolution aligns with Mara's goal, not a cost. Two distinct issues: stakes never materialize as concrete pressure, and escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten when the piano bench puzzle demands decoding under famine urgency. Mara’s agency drives escalation—lullaby memory to key presses—with cost unmistakable in "chains rusted loose" as the wall falls, reweighting freedom’s price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (transforming broken trust) tightens via forge's "inhaling the void" to produce lullaby, but pressure lacks concrete trade-offs—no option foreclosed or resource lost. Accumulative escalation deepens meaning but avoids tangible cost; "cells divide" timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical clock.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: rose unlocks jar, lilies reconfigure purpose, map reveals chamber. But no opposition or cost—conductor aids her, no trade-off paid. "Heart raced, not for riches" hints at internal conflict but lacks dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (crafting safe zones) is clear early, but conflict lacks tangible pressure escalation—no moment where thawing ice actively threatens her work. The "abandon illusion of control" turn deepens stakes conceptually, but cost remains felt rather than viscerally dramatized until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as decoding method (stunt moves as cipher keys) narrows options, but library's near-collapse resolution lacks sufficient visible cost—the "cascade of dust" feels underweighted against the vial's demanded "confession."

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain poetic abstraction ("charting void") without concrete cost; storm pressure intensifies atmospherically but doesn't narrow options through oracle's agency. Escalation lacks felt trade-off despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (thawing mistrust) tightens through lens projection deepening the town's collective honesty, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; Mara observes rather than actively overcomes opposition under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) tightens through marble polishings narrowing options toward the oak. But "luck gauge" coincidence complicates without raising cost—measurable hum feels unearned. Agency drives escalation, yet the cost ("fragile yet fierce triumphs") lacks concrete on-page manifestation until final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (proving temporal drift) signaled immediately. Escalation via textural deepening: hum → amber arcs → unfurling buds. Cost is conceptual (altered worldview), but stakes remain abstract—no personal risk beyond professional validation. Agency clear but pressure lacks visceral urgency despite poetic intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through textural accumulation (water patterns → shifting symbols), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven friction—Mara discovers rather than earns the solution. Cost is felt ("ghost seemed to smile... fading") yet ambiguous; the ghost's departure lacks concrete tradeoff Mara actively chooses, missing the 8.8+ band guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via sensory deepening (“ink bled, faint lines emerged”) narrows options under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the console’s truth-weight revelation. Agency-driven pressure lacks one concrete trade-off; barometer adjustment’s stakes feel conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (quantifying swallowed truth's weight) tightens through Mara's appraisal method, but escalation feels passive; the radio fragments' "Morse code of fear" deepens knowledge without altering tactics. Cost is felt but not visibly reconfiguring options post-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (seeking regenerative silence) remains abstract; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks narrowing of options. Keeper’s entrance into refuge resolves without tangible cost—centuries erased feels like convenience, not earned trade-off under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes in linking wonder to ordinary magic deepen through the eclipse's approach, but the cost remains conceptual (generational shift) rather than a felt trade-off on Liora's part; pressure accumulates without narrowing her tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes remain abstract despite pattern accumulation. Zero friction in discoveries—no trade-offs, sacrifice, or personal cost for the historian despite the conceptual weight of "last human dream."

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes ("encoding human heartbeats to survive mortality") deepen conceptually, but pressure never escalates—implementation succeeds flawlessly with no meaningful trade-off or narrowed options, violating escalation requirements for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes ("possession completes") lack operational tension; the "clock of possession" isn't a live constraint altering tactics. Pressure accumulates texturally through looping resonance rather than protagonist agency narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (hearing symphonies) signaled early but pressure doesn't escalate through protagonist agency; lake's transformation feels coincidental not earned. Band guardrail violated—no visible price charging final image despite conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes ("conquer labyrinth of self") signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; pressure grows via environmental shifts ("fractured timelines widening") not character choices. Cost ("carry weight") legible but not visibly shaped by prior decisions, limiting high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Quarantine stake signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation; lateral thinking resolves tension without narrowing options or raising cost. Pressure remains static despite atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen organically as scent collage shifts from personal (mother’s death) to universal ("every fragment of history"), narrowing Arlen’s goal to cataloging sorrow. Cost is visceral: tears for lost cities, yet the escalation lacks friction—no active resistance to his new mission weakens the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure (choices multiplying into "tapestry"), but firefly/lantern dilemma lacks tangible consequences, weakening mid-escalation. Dominant stake (time's texture) reweights at closure with undeniable conceptual cost, though secondary pressure feels underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen as violinist transforms silence ("gentle hum that cradled the fire's glow"), but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Conceptual cost legible though tangible tradeoffs absent. Meets one-tightening requirement under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (harvesting sellable emotion) tightens via Mara's ritual, but pressure lacks visible cost escalation; the "weight of half truths" implies conceptual cost yet feels abstract without concrete forfeiture (e.g., emotional toll on Mara) to charge the closure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure (misdelivery → shared grief → community ceremony), but the fishermen's sardine gift arrives as off-stage convenience rather than earned consequence of Mara's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (community connection) signaled early but pressure never coheres—search for tag faces zero resistance, villagers join without friction. Under accumulative lens, escalation lacks deepening: sensory density increases but stakes remain abstract ("shared longing") with no visible price paid. Final softening ache implies cost but doesn't legibly charge the image per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes deepen through the "interrupted cadence" motif, but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs: Mira’s choices face no narrowing options or tactical cost (e.g., borrowing time requires no sacrifice). Agency drives accumulation, yet the absence of visible price—like exhaustion or lost opportunity—prevents cost from being "unmistakable" per the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.3)
    No meaningful escalation: "ambiguous loss" is thematic but never tests the conjurer through concrete stakes. The drip-on-stone "chime" is coincidence, not agency-driven pressure. Dominant stake (understanding emotion's math) lacks opposition or trade-offs; no narrowing of options occurs before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (becoming visible through grief’s acknowledgment) tightens via tape’s activation, narrowing options to conduit-or-invisibility. Agency-driven escalation falters slightly—the reel’s discovery feels coincidental, not earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (observing transformation) is clear but unchallenged; no active opposition. Escalation via accumulation works for lens, but "reluctant" leaf isn't resisting Marlowe, limiting tension depth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (art for convergence) tightens via the exchange, but the cost of surrendered paintings feels abstract when Mara immediately paints the convergence; stakes lack visceral escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (magnifying magic) signaled early, but escalation isn’t driven by Lira’s agency—the cave acts upon her. Cost felt but not through protagonist choice; misses Q4 9+ test’s agency requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (compiling fragments despite absences) tightens through density increase as fragments accumulate, but protagonist agency remains passive reception rather than active choice. "Courage to let gaps breathe" lacks visible on-page cost demonstration per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen credibly from mapping alleys to bearing humanity's hidden narratives; escalation via cold walls and pulsing arrows raises cost, but "fortress" motivation lacks friction—no moment questioning if truth-bearing is worth the burden.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (reconciling doubt/wonder) escalate via tile revelations narrowing Lira’s options, with agency in transcribing; cost—emotional shift to "rare peace"—is legible but lacks visceral tangibility in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (boredom vs. curiosity) tightens through spatial mutiny's pressure—corridors coalesce into tunnel via protagonist's choice to press amulet. Cost legible in dissolved amulet and transformed heartbeat syncing with chorus. Single meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (asylum proof) tighten via grief’s pressure, but escalation relies on coincidence (mourners’ sighs) rather than Mara’s agency; cost is bureaucratic, not personal, missing band guardrail for high 8.0s.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (collecting time textures) deepens via realization about bridges, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; cost is felt yet not earned through meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through the label’s peeling numbers and tide-triggered projections, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—the sea’s rhythm drives change, not character agency against rising opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (how myths endure) tightens via the shell-led ledger discovery, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Selene’s agency is reactive (following clues), not active; cost (accepting truth’s fluidity) feels intellectual rather than visceral, weakening stakes’ emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving carnival soul) tightens through Mira's agency: encoding graffiti narrows options toward community reorganization. Conceptual cost (ongoing gentrification threat) legibly charges the final image, though privatization pressure could feel more viscerally immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: chemical countdown forces the decisive capture moment, narrowing options to "now or never" with felt cost in "grief" as the grain’s vanishing; dominant stake (preserving vanishing history) tightens relentlessly under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via sensory deepening: water’s ripples reveal hidden membrane curvature, narrowing options to the polymer patch. The "slight lag" is a felt price altering future tactics (noted in her data log), with Mara’s agency driving the tightening—no coincidence resolves the tear.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (rivers' origin) deepen through atmospheric pressure, but "after falcon returns" timeframe lacks live-clock tension; agency in Mara's transmitter action feels earned though escalation leans slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (revival) signaled early but pressure never concretely tests commitment; no live option foreclosed or trade-off made. Escalation through rhythmic density works, yet cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt until final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: battery waning forces beacon sacrifice, narrowing options to "share scent or save self." Cost is unmistakable—beacon fade—reconfiguring her goal from capture to release. Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens without coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stake (proving warnings true) tightens via map discovery, yet cost remains abstract; no visible price paid (e.g., injury, exhaustion). Agency in "threading labyrinth" drives escalation, but conceptual redemption lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency as bead placements narrow options toward the fatal sigh, with cost unmistakable in her dissolution. Debt-repayment stake tightens through textural density, though the "final payment" mechanism lacks concrete friction before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (carving reverence from ruin) tightens via the plate’s evolution and guilds’ crumbling, but pressure lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or protagonist-driven deepening. Cost (empty tide pools, broken precedents) is felt but not actively paid; reliance on atmospheric accumulation weakens causal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restoring faith) signaled early, but pressure accumulates without meaningful tightening—no live option foreclosed or trade-off. Cost felt in "cautious calm" but lacks visceral escalation; resolution hinges on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as chalk code intensifies into quantum projection, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; cost ("weight of every chalk line") feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes signaled early (uncovering coup evidence), but pressure lacks escalation—no opposition or tangible trade-offs. Single tightening (decoding baker’s pouch) deepens knowledge, yet protagonist faces zero resistance; flame "obliges" without cost, undercutting agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: evoking letters narrows options from internal burden to external release. Cost (dissolved grief) is legible, but the spirits’ intervention risks passive resolution—mitigated by her embodied act of breathing deep to "evoke buried voices."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes ("unknot fear-laden knots") deepen through coral absorption, yet escalation relies on anesthetic coincidence rather than protagonist agency; "shared anxieties" reweighting lacks tangible tactical cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    No meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens; dominant stake (rediscovering joy) faces no pressure or narrowing of options—fog thins effortlessly, scholars resolve problems instantly, and the artist encounters zero resistance despite "centuries of thick fog" setting.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (certainty vs curiosity) tightens through Lena's brush-tap agency, but escalation leans passive until climax; visible cost in drifting certainty earns high band despite minimal middle development.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (thought taxation) signaled early, but pressure never escalates—Dr. Mirabel's shift to ally feels coincidental, not earned by Lysander's agency. No narrowing of options or visible cost; "battlefield of ideas" remains abstract without concrete test. Conceptual cost lands but lacks tactical reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (converting ache into healing language) tightens when the postcard’s nebulae "burst into full bloom," forcing the poet’s realization that verses are "water" for cosmic seeds. Cost is conceptual: centuries of sorrow transmuted into generational hope, felt in the "dissolve[ed]" lullabies.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving names against oblivion) tightens via the traveler’s arrival, narrowing options to gifting the orchid. Cost is felt in the caretaker’s softened regret—loss persists but purpose crystallizes. Agency is renunciation-focused, though escalation lacks visceral pressure spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through glyph progression from curve to storm-knot, with "time pressed" tightening options; cost is felt in the weight of "renewed covenant," though vague urgency lacks concrete clock pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single dominant stake (preservation vs. progress) tightens via Mira's adhesive-to-binary discovery, forcing trade-offs in valve adjustment. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the elder's shifted stance and "ash settling" as conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten through accumulating paper trails, but escalation relies on external validation (community humming) rather than protagonist agency; the "wilt of memory" cost is legible yet the resolution softens pressure via coincidental chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens via "necessary distances" density increase, but butterfly effect timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics despite strong cost in "shedding weight of loss."

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes ("rhythm of belonging") lack tangible opposition; escalation is atmospheric intensification (fireflies multiplying) not agency-driven. Conceptual cost lands in final image but misses visceral trade-offs required for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (disappearing paths) are clear, but pressure doesn't accumulate organically—the seed method works perfectly on first attempt with no earned reversal or tactical cost until closure, undermining agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes ("ordering randomness") remain abstract—no narrowing of options or visible price paid. Ink washes away harmlessly; performer immediately plans next sequence. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen through pressure of "slipping through invisible cracks," but cost of fledging remains abstract until ink application; escalation lacks one visible pre-climax price for 8.2+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (finding value in mundane) remain abstract without visceral escalation; pressure stagnates as passive observation. "Before everything shifts" implies time pressure but lacks live-clock consequences, failing to narrow options or generate trade-offs under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (translating pain) is signaled early, but pressure never escalates beyond internal reflection; the town square resolution arrives without prior tactical shifts or earned cost demonstration in the ridge scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (revitalizing faith via equations) tightens through balloon releases, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Arin observes patterns rather than adapting tactics. Cost remains conceptual (communal hope) without visceral forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen organically from discovery to communion, but climate shifts lack causal pressure; the "shared responsibility" shift feels earned though the cost (solitude to shared burden) isn’t viscerally tested until scholars arrive late in the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes ("possibilities") remain abstract despite early signaling; escalation lacks tangible cost or narrowed options, with bell-ringing resolution feeling coincidental rather than earned by painter's agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (redemption’s price) tightens through density increase (firelight to dawn), but chieftains’ resolution feels passive—Lira’s agency drives the turn, yet the cost ("letting go of grudges") remains abstractly stated, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (defying conformity) signaled early with meaningful deepening as echoes accumulate. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure spikes; threads "loosen" passively without visible cost paid during untangling.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stake (ethical storytelling method) tightens when the waning ember forces Selene's agency—"lifted the stick, and the fire's glow brightened"—changing knowledge about puppet strings. Cost is visible in "let the fire die" (sacrificing physical tool) and ash settlement, driving the Accumulative escalation toward conceptual reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.7)
    No protagonist-driven escalation; monarchs' departure happens independently, leaving Lira reactive. Her knot-tying lacks narrowing options or trade-offs—pressure from migration is atmospheric, not causal under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake tightening occurs when rope reconfiguration yields names (Leif/Sigrid), deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost (Mara's solstice commitment) is legible, but escalation lacks a tangible price paid mid-scene beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (paths choosing walkers) deepens via interpreted dreams, but storm pressure remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt. No visible price paid until final image, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.3)
    No tangible escalation: "between regimes" timeframe never tightens decisions (no clock, no consequences), and cosmic stakes remain abstract. Resolution requires zero agency beyond tracing lines; no visible price paid for covenant sealing under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes (releasing resentment) lack protagonist agency—Mara “waits” passively while the box’s magic resolves conflict. No visible price paid; monks’ change feels effortless without trade-offs. Pressure grows texturally but fails band guardrail for 8.8+: no tangible cost altering tactics despite strong conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful—ribbon snag crystallizes the "fragile line between care and chaos," narrowing Lira’s options to immediate mending. Conceptual cost is unmistakable when the breach transforms from "careless trade" to "seed of renewal," reweighting stakes through her earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (understanding nonlinear inheritance) tightens through failed inquiries until bathroom epiphanies force surrender of linear narrative. Cost is visceral when void "flooded his mind with whispers of futures," altering his entire relationship to time with palpable disquiet.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes deepen through Selene’s agency: researching gaps narrows options (third gap → cavern), sacrificing diary pages imposes escalating costs. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via symphony’s cadence shifts ("swelled" at portal) with conceptual cost (knowledge as living sacrifice) unmistakable on final page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes (recapturing sea verses) signaled early but escalation is externally driven—ink river "spills," garden appears without protagonist tradeoffs. Cost ("weight and release") is conceptual but not tied to her actions; diving into ink feels inevitable, not chosen. Agency as attention (cataloging silence) forecloses no path with visible cost, weakening Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under Accumulative/Textural lens: reweaving the rope intensifies density ("low chord that echoed fables of absence"), narrowing options to the final braid.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (quiet vs. storm) signaled early, but pressure doesn’t tighten meaningfully: mapkeeper’s solution feels procedural, not pressured. Cost (perpetual vigilance) stated but not viscerally felt; energy beings’ departure relies on coincidence, undermining agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake ("prove coincidences have meaning") is signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. The caravan’s arrival resolves the conflict coincidentally rather than through earned agency, violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule. No visible price paid for rekindling.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (sculpting identity from memory) signaled early but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; fog/shadow shifts complicate but don't narrow his options. Cost legible ('preemptive nostalgia turn[ing] into steady resolve') yet feels atmospheric rather than earned through struggle. Strength: coherent accumulative tightening via deepening hush. Weakness: passive observation dominates over active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes ("defy gravity of hopelessness") intensify through chant/spark rituals, but lack concrete opposition—hopelessness remains ambient rather than testing commitment with visible trade-offs during the firework burst.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via sensory accumulation (owl call altering ripples, breeze softening water's edge) deepens the stake of reading transition periods. Cost is felt in the chronicler's expended emotional labor to "sense the texture of time," though clan conflict remains abstractly off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("sour bite... sweet aftertaste"), yet escalation lacks narrowing—no moment where exposure limit risks failure, missing Band 8.8+ requirement for visible price altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stake (silence as comfort) signaled early with one meaningful deepening (amber to silver cascade). Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens but lacks protagonist agency—Lira observes/reacts rather than makes contested choices. Cost (empty vial) is visible but not tied to her action.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (claim throne before sunrise) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mina follows sigils passively.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (teaching darkness to breathe) tightens through encroachment beats, but "burning bridges" lacks visible tactical cost; pressure accumulates without narrowing options sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (translating pressure into diamonds) tightens through glitchy texts' algorithm, narrowing options to one decisive choice. Cost made legible via diamonds' conditional existence. "Virtuously mischievous" trait remains descriptive rather than driving Lira's pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (uncovering truth) signaled early but pressure never escalates: gramophone works perfectly on first try with zero struggle. No narrowing of options or visible price paid; "betrayal by ignorance" revelation lacks dramatic weight due to absent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake ("capture possibility") never concretizes into trade-offs—knight shifts allegiance without friction; "endless night" pressure accumulates texturally but lacks deepening under Accumulative lens, leaving cost (armor melting) emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: button discovery → supervisor buy-in → new file activation. Cost (emotional labor of "broken heart") deepens through tactile details (button's weight, dust swirls), but pressure lacks tangible opposition beyond bureaucratic erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (fighting indifference) tightens via transmitter activation; Mara's whisper forces rulers to "confront ghosts" with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (preventing fire-storm prophecy) tighten through saxophonist's agency, but escalation lacks visible price paid during the act; pressure deepens via sensory density rather than tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes ("weight of names") signaled early but remain abstract; search party's vanishing introduces potential cost yet fails to concretely tighten her choices. Escalation through ritual intensity lacks visceral trade-off—no tool, time, or emotional resource visibly depleted during the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds: harp's discordant notes intensify density until laughter triggers transformation. Mara's agency in telling the joke narrows options with visible cost (emotional vulnerability). Stakes remain visceral through "fragile thread of pain" imagery, though the cost could deepen beyond softening ache.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes deepen through sensory cost (light searing skin), yet the "mathematics of mercy" revelation lacks meaningful escalation—the crystal roots climax emerges abruptly without sufficient pressure buildup from prior bracing moments.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Mara's agency: following calliope sound escalates risk to attic hatch, where ledger discovery forces emotional trade-off (burden for purpose). Cost is felt in "strange lightness" as she lifts the weightless burden.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (system destabilization) signaled early, but escalation lacks Mara's agency—she reacts passively to the whisper's "rustling." Cost is conceptual yet framed positively ("true wonder"), diluting felt trade-offs under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Time pressure ("midnight had already begun to steal...") meaningfully tightens tactics, narrowing options to the final gear alignment. Conceptual cost (covenant's truth-dependence) is legible in the resolution beat without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Mara's agency: her psychometry readings deepen the dominant stake (seeking meaning vs. embracing void). Cost is unmistakable—"explanations dissolved" and the compass's shift to pointing toward rain reweights her entire quest.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through Mira’s agency as she reimagines the archway, narrowing options from solitary craft to communal reflection; cost is visible in scars and "endless tide of learning," though turbine sync slightly softens pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Mara's agency: postcard placement narrows options to visceral revelation, with "cold doubts" forfeiture as visible cost. Single deepening (glass cavity discovery) sufficiently reweights the "why flowers bloom" stake under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (truth vs. suppression) tighten through debris negotiation, but escalation lacks visible cost—Qadir's parley resolves too neatly without tradeoffs, failing to reweight pressure under the Accumulative lens despite strong density buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)

The absence of a concrete setback during mental construction—no failed recollection or memory resistance—softens the cost, leaving stakes feeling abstract despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes remain abstract: "archiving emotional patterns" vs prophecy lacks concrete test. Third-grade memory "bridge" feels inserted, not earned escalation. Cost is conceptual (dew-weight) without tactical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully as the vortex tightens Mira's options (surrendering the cap to merge lineage with phoenix fire), but the dominant conflict remains ethereal—pressure accumulates texturally yet lacks visceral, character-specific consequences beyond the abstract "vanishing" cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (precision vs. clamor) tighten via the glue-drying timer, forcing protagonist’s agency; cost is tangible in the retired rope, but emotional weight remains understated during the bell’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) is declared but never viscerally tested; no narrowing of options occurs as Mara smoothly decodes clues. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt through agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (harmonizing discord) tightens through feather's placement, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is conceptual (accepting incompleteness) yet feels abstract; kite-string snaps complicate but don't deepen the central tension meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes ("price of forgiveness") are signaled early, but escalation is textural, not causal: poetry sessions deepen mood without narrowing options. Cost ("shared memory") is felt but not visible—townsfolk instantly "feel weight lift" with no sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist’s narration narrows options to "surrendering fear," with visceral cost in "sealing the alchemist’s doubts" via liquid light.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (unused courage) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ferry guides drive the journey. Cost is felt ("sudden freedom") yet abstract; no visible trade-off during the cave sequence narrows options insufficiently for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (cost of safety) signaled early but nerve regeneration lacks tangible pressure. Bolt's transformation drives meaningful deepening, yet escalation isn't protagonist-driven; bellhop's action feels ritualistic not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten when the watermark reveals the canyon’s role, shifting from cartographic curiosity to symptom of ecological disorientation. Cost is conceptual (larvae navigation collapse) but legible in log entry; pressure accumulates through rhythmic data assembly under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes ("discover meaning") deepen through hum's accumulation, but stone's autonomous response—not protagonist agency—resolves conflict. Cost remains abstract despite "felt" language, failing Q4 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake ("evolve tradition") tightens via decoding/unsealing, but elder's off-page warning dilutes on-page pressure; memory sacrifice provides cost yet stakes remain conceptually abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes crystallize around anchoring hope in tragedy, but escalation relies on internal density shifts rather than protagonist-driven narrowing; the cost ("love survived" via photo ridge) is felt but not leveraged to alter tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative density ("walls close in," cards rearranging"), but the "necessary darkness" pressure feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven—the slamming door isn't motivated by Elian's choices. Cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt, missing band guardrail requirements for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes deepen as ink patterns rise, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Kael triggers events yet pressure stems from ink's behavior, not his choices. No visible price paid; conceptual cost ("oblivion") remains abstract without on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens: "dormant networks" humming intensifies to "thunderous echo," narrowing Maren's option to act, but the cost (personal preservation risk) feels abstract rather than viscerally felt in the final beat despite green shoots' symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes remain abstract ("weaving continuity") with no tangible opposition or escalation; the boy’s compass moment resolves too easily, avoiding meaningful trade-offs, and the dominant stake faces no on-page test that alters Lira’s tactics or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate through density increase (constellations tangling, patterns breaking), but cost remains abstract. Dominant stake ("catch the echo") lacks visible price; "lingering pulse" feels unearned as payoff. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. cover-up) is clear early, but pressure never escalates: inserting the nib works immediately with no resistance, narrowing, or cost paid. Journalist's arrival resolves conflict coincidentally, undercutting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (hushing guilt) tightens via Lyra’s firmware confrontation, narrowing options to one decisive action; cost is felt in her chest’s "loosen[ing]" but lacks concrete trade-off (e.g., expended resource), preventing higher escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes stay abstract—lilac unease lacks concrete cost despite vivid language; violinist's arrival introduces secondary conflict without deepening primary tension, violating single-stake focus for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen texturally through "warm coldness" evolution, but protagonist agency lacks escalation—pressure arrives via stone's demand rather than earned tactical shifts. Cost ("retrocognitively trapped past dissolve") feels resonant yet insufficiently visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through ghost’s escalating echoes ("cascade through maze’s hedges"), narrowing options to one final song. Cost remains conceptual until shopkeeper’s intervention, slightly diluting felt urgency pre-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes crystallize early—"can skepticism coexist with wonder?"—and tighten through Mara's self-experimentation. Agency drives escalation (programming LEDs, mapping skin), but the conceptual cost remains abstract; the fragility of "willowglass hope" needs more visceral forfeiture to land fully in this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (bridging memory) lacks meaningful tightening; cavern "breathing" to aid ritual crosses into coincidence resolving pressure rather than protagonist-driven escalation under textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (unscrambling prophecy to reverse time) is abstract with no visceral cost or coherent pressure buildup. Cataloging buttons lacks escalation—no trade-offs, narrowing options, or protagonist-driven deepening. Resolution feels mechanical, not earned through altered stance or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via protagonist agency: decoding snow-melt letters narrows options to the glen pass, with the felt cost of dissolved past ties crystallizing in the valley’s "crystal spring" moment under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via gutter-tick countdown, narrowing Arlen's options to passive waiting. Cost is visible in "muddy path" steps and "mind closely attentive to lingering calm." Escalation driven by ambient awareness method, but dominant stake (distilling complexity) lacks concrete opposition beyond time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully as Mara’s kindness awakens the hive, but cost remains abstract; "sharp gentleness" implies toll yet lacks visceral felt price, weakening the Accumulative escalation’s payoff despite strong agency in her lantern offering.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (darkness vs. light-as-safety) tightens through Mara’s ritual timing ("after final petal drops") and physical vulnerability on ledge. Escalation via density increase—quivering hush transforming to settled chorus—reweights cost as emotional exposure, though no secondary stake deepens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes (isolation→independence) are signaled early but lack organic escalation; the stone circle’s hum resolves problems it didn’t create, violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve." Agency feels passive as Mira follows a "simple method" without obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (finding connecting thread) remains abstract; no visible price paid. Mira's "content" resolution lacks cost—thread glow is metaphorical, not tactical. Pressure grows through external magic (twigs hum, pond erupts) not her choices. Stakes declared but never viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Mara’s interference escalating cosmic tricksters’ threat into a false solar flare alarm. Cost feels earned as community anxiety dissolves, though the tricksters’ defeat lacks visceral struggle, muting escalation’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through spatial mutiny’s tangible cost (claustrophobia tightening breath), but the "rebellion against forgetting" moral remains abstract—pressure lacks visceral personal consequence beyond the explorer’s immediate relief.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (awakening empathy for cold cases) tightens when ribbon reveals child's name, forcing Mara's physical/emotional escalation. Cost (reclaiming sorrow) is visceral but quarry's fissure response edges toward coincidence under Accumulative lens; agency remains Mara's.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (protecting nail as moral compass) tightens via vortex threat, but escalation relies on external storm rather than protagonist agency; cost ("dread into resolve") legible though pressure lacks Mara-driven deepening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten via "ridge summit" deadline but pixelated amnesty mechanics remain abstract; "heart hammered with luminous disbelief" provides felt cost though agency in resolution leans coincidental (music triggering amnesty lacks established rules).

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (decoding alone vs. sharing burdens) tightens through Accumulative deepening as symbols accumulate pressure. Agency clear in whispering to sky and telescope alignment, but cost remains conceptual ("fracture within doubts") without tangible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (unbending confession) tightens via chant's expanding rings, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; the vortex's surrender feels coincidental rather than earned by the druid's actions. Cost remains conceptual without tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (unlocking covenant) lacks escalation—zero obstacles test commitment; "anxious elation" named but not dramatized through conflicting actions.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative escalation succeeds through sigil-carving and card dissolution deepening the "mend soul holes" stake; cost legibility falters—burden "lightening" is conceptual but lacks tangible sacrifice beyond the card's physical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: cataloging relics to insulate → concrete clatter triggering drum memory → dust/sunrise reconfiguration. Cost is visceral (public shame) and conceptual (redefining success), culminating in "quiet conviction" that forecloses spotlight dependency with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: seed planting proves theory, narrowing options to valley journey; cost is legible in spirit's departure and "calm after the storm of ambition," perfectly scaling to length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder after time rupture) escalates through smelting the key, narrowing options to acceptance of contradictions. Cost is legible in softened gears and visitors' quiet gratitude, though emotional weight could deepen further.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes deepen through confession absorption, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mara acts as conduit rather than driving pressure. The "crown" ritual forecloses her old role with visible cost, yet the tightening feels preordained, not earned through her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes in self-forgiveness deepen through bathroom graffiti to river confession, but medication withdrawal's urgency lacks tangible escalation; cost ("fragile stone I dared to keep") feels earned yet insufficiently pressured by the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain abstract—no tangible cost paid until garden (implied fragility of words). Pressure never tightens; mission succeeds effortlessly despite "cautious" framing. No trade-offs or tactical shifts under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through coffee stain readings narrowing options under Accumulative lens, but the "weeks" timeframe remains abstract rather than a live clock altering tactics, missing band guardrail requirement for visible price charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through pattern-finding density (Accumulative escalation), narrowing options as aurora fades. Cost is unmistakable—the dimming aurora acknowledges transfer—but "oblivion" remains slightly abstract, lacking visceral immediacy despite the chip’s pulse synchronizing with protagonist’s heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (finding contentment) remain abstract until climax; "betrayal" backstory lacks on-page test. Pressure deepens via hairpin ritual but cost feels retrospective rather than viscerally felt during the single tightening beat at sunrise alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (reverse aging as curse/gift) signaled early, but pressure never tightens—Mira's "withholding" lacks active resistance, and the grotto reveal happens without earned struggle; conceptual cost is felt but not viscerally tested under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation via textural density (bird spirals/arrowhead resonance) reweights navigation stakes; cost legible but agency remains observational, limiting pressure’s causal drive under textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through atmospheric pressure alone: the keystone’s "lingering luminance" deepens from rumored anchor to embodied memory of forgotten wonders, narrowing options to humility’s acceptance with the visible cost of his magic’s quiet glow replacing fireworks.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.9)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: Eli's vow to "discover color of sound" tightens when floating books emit vibrating hues, forcing his choice to open the glowing tome. The cost is unmistakable—physical transformation via the teal-hued sigil binding his key tag—and reshapes his final vow. Pressure accumulates texturally without coincidence; his purposeful choices narrow options toward irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (decoding prophecy for purpose) tightens via the coin-turning act, but escalation relies on cosmic revelation rather than protagonist agency—pressure grows through pattern recognition, not earned adaptation to obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: naming each monster narrows options toward the final whisper, with visible cost in "echo of sacrifice pulse louder." Escalation driven by protagonist under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable as "centuries of unfinished farewells" dissolve into aurora.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—dripping rhythm alignment narrows options to a single resonant pulse—but cost legibility falters; the "ghostly echo" fish is potent yet insufficiently foregrounded as a trade-off against the river's revival during the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (expunging myth) tightens through photographic revelations, with cost unmistakable in "dam inside them cracked open." Agency slightly undermined by photographs feeling discovered rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Selene’s agency: channeling starlings’ rhythm deepens the ritual’s pressure, narrowing options to the shard arrangement. Cost is legible in her "sentimental surge" during gathering, though the dominant stake (logic-heart harmony) lacks visceral physical trade-offs beyond emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten via radio static escalation, but "Hold fast" resolution leans on coincidence; cost legibility falters as burden "lifts fractionally" without concrete sacrifice shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens through Kael's internal deepening ("pair each breath of calm with a strike of purpose"). Cost is visceral in "numbness cracking," but Syndicate/Guardians apply generic pressure without adapting tactics, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake ("safeguard space for innovation") stays abstract with no tangible cost or opposition. Participants solve puzzles smoothly, the seed blooms obligingly—missing the "credible loss" requirement. Escalation via cipher-solving lacks meaningful trade-offs, failing to narrow options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes remain abstract until late ("kitchen bowl clanged with sound of plates being set down in laughter" summarized not dramatized); pressure tightens via Accumulative lens but visible cost lacks visceral immediacy despite conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through the pendant's physical presence narrowing options (take vs wait), but the cult's threat remains off-page complication rather than coherent pressure; cost of waiting is conceptually weighty yet lacks visceral, dramatized consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (interrupting destiny) tightens through successive tincture adjustments. Agency-driven escalation with visible cost ("hopelessness lift") forecloses predetermined path via crozier’s revival.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (transforming decay into renewal) signaled early via "city’s decay" and "final silence."

Escalation under Accumulative lens via density shift (static→melodic creation).

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate via density (radio waves, rising sand) under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost ("paradox of permanence") remains abstract. Agency-driven escalation lacks unmistakable on-page price—urgency of commuter rush vs. eternity feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through weaving-driven eruptions that narrow options toward reality's dissolution, with cost legible in the architect's irreversible shift from illusion. Agency feels passive during golden-rain eruption; pressure accumulates without active protagonist adaptation at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate via Mira's agency plotting vectors and interpreting the anchor's physics, with felt cost in "mournful precision." But pressure lacks visceral narrowing—success feels inevitable rather than earned through meaningful tactical sacrifice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (protecting voices) signals early but lacks escalation under pressure. Hearing aid pulses never threaten failure—no narrowing of options. "Sealed alcove" introduces no cost; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten credibly as tide rises toward apex, but the phase transition’s danger ("strand her in a void") lacks felt cost escalation—Mara’s fear of tight spaces isn’t tested *during* the shift, missing a chance to deepen the dominant stake through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through ink-pattern density under Accumulative lens, with Mara's agency driving defragmentation; cost is legible in "bureaucrats had tried to erase," though emotional toll remains slightly abstract versus physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (save language) tightens via diamond's cracking, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the birds' altered flight is passive observation, not active choice. Cost ("locked forever") is conceptual but not viscerally felt on the storyteller beyond abstract "weight of legacy."

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (placing arrowhead) intensifies static from "nervous pulse" to laughter shifting "mournful to mischievous," narrowing options via arrowhead's destruction. Cost ("bitterness loosen") feels conceptually legible but lacks visceral embodiment in the shattering moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) tightens via the single note’s ripple effect, but escalation lacks earned friction—the statue’s surrender requires no tactical adaptation, reducing cost to mere physical exertion rather than meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Milo’s agency under Accumulative lens: bottle’s static intensifies to flash that forces drone retreat, narrowing options to truce. Cost legible in "weight of rebellion" easing—a visible trade-off for peace.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes ("silence as possibility") are signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mara’s singing triggers magical cause/effect (gears turning, mist thickening) without visible cost or trade-offs. Band guardrail fails: no narrowed options or felt price altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes signaled early ("reawaken analog memories"), escalation via density increase (patrons’ solitary reading → shared communion) reweights dominant stake under Accumulative lens. Cost ("continual care") is felt but not viscerally dramatized; Mara’s agency drives pressure yet feels secondary to the library’s autonomous mechanics during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes (capturing runaway dream) signal early, but pressure accumulates without narrowing options—Lio's net catching light relies on coincidence, not Mara's agency. Escalation lacks felt cost; the deepening (realization about longing) forecloses no path with tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes lack escalation; star "hint" coincidentally resolves conflict without protagonist agency. Wind reveals groove arbitrarily, undercutting pressure accumulation. No narrowing of options or visible cost during key beats. Non-closure accumulation cap applied for single distinct issue.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency (arranging caps triggers receding water), with visible cost in the sea's duality ("kept its secrets, but also kept its gifts"); escalation via pattern break in mushroom arrangement narrows options under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes crystallize too late; "reversible exile" remains thematic echo until tea-leaf decoding. Escalation lacks causal pressure under Accumulative lens—shadow fracture feels coincidental rather than archivist's active choice, undermining agency in pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes ("preserve wonder") declared but never viscerally tested; storm threat resolved via convenient singing without narrowing options. Traveler's arrival is coincidental complication, not protagonist-driven escalation. Missing visible trade-off for "succor" action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via knot-unraveling deepens the dominant stake ("ground restless spirits") with visible cost (Elara's emotional exhaustion), but the "secret" remains abstractly stated. Agency is clear, though secondary pressure lacks tangible complication beyond the net's resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.3)
    No escalation under Accumulative lens: cloud categorization remains static ritual without deepening pressure or narrowing options; "quietly explosive" comet offers revelation but no trade-off or altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Demolition deadline tightens stakes credibly through Lira’s ritualistic pigment timing, but escalation lacks one visible price paid mid-scene (e.g., time lost to mixing errors) to deepen the cost before closure’s tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes ("harness luminance without draining ship") lack escalation; pressure never narrows options as Lira succeeds effortlessly, weakening cost legibility despite the warm presence replacing isolation feeling earned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through pane-of-hush activation narrowing Elara’s options to whispering, but cost remains conceptual—no tangible forfeiture (e.g., vitality loss) to ground the "borrowed pause" trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven entirely by Mara's agency: her foam tracing sparks the lattice insight, which she physically implements. The "translucent bridge" reweights the dominant stake (failure→connection) with undeniable conceptual cost in the chrysalis' transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (finding story origins) tightens via vendor's void-counting method, narrowing options to quantifying absence. Cost legible in dissolved quest weight. Pressure grows through moonlight brightening but stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)

    Dominant stake ("heal scars") never tested—grain elevators comply instantly. No escalation: planks laid without resistance. Agency lacks pressure; cost remains abstract despite "scars" declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (reviving dreams) deepens through density, but tremor pressure doesn’t narrow options—Aria’s "steadying" avoids trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (securing combinations) tightens via gravity inversion’s countdown, but lacks meaningful opposition or personal cost. Pressure grows through Liora’s agency (aligning symbols), yet the conflict remains external—no moral calculus or irreversible loss beyond the doodle’s purpose fading. Stakes feel viscerally urgent but emotionally shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes ("create music in a silent world") deepen texturally through crack analysis, but pressure lacks agency-driven escalation—no live option foreclosed or cost paid. Resolution feels unearned as owls arrive coincidentally, failing to demonstrate irreversible consequence from Auris's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through the tutor's agency: correlating sky patterns forces the bishop/rook placements that narrow options toward covenant rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signaled early (cataloging silence for empathy) but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; tuning method appears late without middle development. Cost ("unheard stories being heard") resonates but isn’t tethered to prior tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes ("patience for bloom") remain abstract with no narrowing of options or tangible cost paid; elders' warning introduces pressure but dissolves into passive waiting. Static escalation lacks meaningful deepening under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten via discovery-to-release escalation under Causal lens, but agency feels passive—the tip "emitted a hum," trees "responded instantly." Cost (dissolution) is visible yet lacks tradeoff; luck nearly resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through accumulative pressure: wind's "subtle notes" to seam's "pulse" to vibration that widens reality. Mara's agency drives escalation (flute manipulation), with visible cost in her realization that old keepers "ignored quiet of failure."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes never materialize as concrete pressure; the halo's approval ("brightened as if approving") removes risk, and the cracking event introduces reward without cost, violating escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by courier's agency: each pendant use deepens emotional density (shepherd's transient wonder → girl's map discovery). Cost legible in "glow dimmed, leaving faint echo" after girl departs. Shepherd interaction lacks tangible price, slightly diluting dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (proving emotional residue in objects) tightens through Accumulative escalation: frost blooming, engine awakening, and "shifted hush" deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (resilience via barter) signaled early, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening. Pressure grows passively—the stone "answered with a low hum," no struggle during tunnel traversal.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten via Lira’s agency: redirecting flow to access hidden log forces moral trade-off (truth’s "weight" vs. crew’s freedom). Cost is unmistakable—the shard’s destruction—yet escalation’s sole tightening feels slightly underdeveloped in the log-revelation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Marek's agency: lamp failure tightens stakes, forcing ritual adaptation; visible cost ("luminescent ache settling like a tide") forecloses reliance on external light, but the single deepening lacks sharper trade-offs beyond emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (shaping dawn with shadows) tightens through ritual execution, but escalation lacks tangible tradeoffs; Mira's urgency ("act now") isn't pressured by concrete loss. Agency feels ritual-bound rather than choice-driven under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding narrative magnetism) signaled early but escalation static—pressure accumulates without meaningful deepening. Sun trails keep revealing more (scrolls, gardens, loom) without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs; cost remains abstract despite closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: sorrow dimming as dreams map reweights options with felt cost (easing chest pulse).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through atmospheric escalation (night softening to twilight), but dominant pressure lacks protagonist agency-driven trade-offs. "Knits communities" repetition substitutes for earned cost in communal gathering beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through the recluse's internal agency as he interprets nested paradoxes, with visible cost in his transformed perspective; "within arm's reach of midnight" lacks tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (understanding weather-carriers) tighten via the convergence event and forest election's humidity shift, narrowing Arin's options to sensory surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Lena’s painting-as-key ritual, yet "suppressed creativity" remains abstract; the vial’s release lacks tangible forfeiture, muting escalation’s cost despite lyrical resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) signaled early but pressure never escalates—wind’s "tempered vigor" and routine glisten-coaxing lack meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate only once (tide rising) with minimal pressure—singing resolves lock effortlessly—failing to narrow options or impose trade-offs; "calm defiance" concept remains abstract rather than testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (memory origin) signaled early but pressure never tightens; coffee-spiral trigger lacks resistance or trade-offs. Agency passive—no narrowing of options under Accumulative lens beyond pattern completion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (prevent celestial rupture) remains abstract—no on-page complication tests commitment. Ritual proceeds without resistance; "cost" is merely fatigue, not a trade-off. Pressure never escalates under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate via Accumulative lens: meteor shower’s "fleeting hymns" deepen density as narrator moves from decoding inscriptions to "hearing heartbeats of forgotten walls." Cost is humility and reframed purpose, visible in "newly fluent" realization. Single tightening sufficient for scope.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (isolation→independence) deepen through seashell’s resonance but lack tangible pressure; cost is felt (pulse dimming) yet escalation remains atmospheric without narrowing Lira’s options beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (forgiveness vs. treason) tightens when Liora chooses "balm," but cost is conceptual not visceral. Escalation lacks agency-driven deepening; the drip rhythm accumulates pressure yet feels detached from her internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes deepen through progressive disclosure, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the canyon "reveals" layers passively. Cost at closure (echoes released) is conceptual but not felt; no visible price alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through dream-pattern accumulation, but pressure lacks narrowing cost; the whisperer encounters no resistance (globe "pulsed brighter" instantly), missing the escalation’s felt price required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake ("appreciate hidden effort") signaled early but pressure never escalates—contemplation remains static. No tightening under Accumulative lens; "demure audacity" asserted but not earned through struggle. Stakes stay abstract despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency (reassembling fragments narrows search), but the epiphany feels slightly convenient; cost is legible in her responsibility shift though internal tension lacks sufficient friction during critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (forging variant allegiance) signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Pressure grows through atmospheric density rather than tactical narrowing—copper coils' success feels coincidental. Cost (storm's ferocity) is visceral but not directly tied to choices. One deepening (radio frequencies unfolding rebellion) suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via accumulating sounds narrows options to sharing with child; cost of centuries' burden lifts visibly. Agency drives density increase under Accumulative lens. Stake signaled early with tangible tightening at village child's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through vibrational matching’s agency-driven deepening, with visible cost in tear and "less fractured" world; sunset’s urgency narrows options but secondary conflict with seekers remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake ("sculpt patience") signaled early but escalation lacks visible price: the moon-surge beat intensifies pressure yet alters no tactics, and the "crack of release" is environmental, not a paid cost. No trade-off narrows options; tension operates only at sentence level, failing the 8.8+ requirement for cost charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (breaking neglectful oversight) tightens credibly through humidity-valve discovery, but "controlling influence" remains abstract; cost legibility suffers as Mara's victory lacks tangible sacrifice beyond emotional vulnerability, weakening pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through density increase (gears as "memory of a life") as chaplain exposes mechanisms, narrowing options to "fresh spring" choice. Cost legible when apology transforms into action, but light coincidence complicates rather than escalates under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (finding crew's truth) tightens via Lia's lie triggering algorithm redistribution.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reconstituting wholeness) tightens through mirror sequence, but cost remains abstract ("weight of unspoken hopes") without tangible forfeiture. Escalation via protagonist’s alignment of shards feels earned, yet lacks concrete trade-off beyond emotional resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (fear of endings vs. seeking quiet release) tightens through Accumulative pressure as wind/ice motifs deepen. Cost legible in "grip on reality loosened" tactile detail. Agency passive (listening/observing) but valid for lens; could deepen protagonist's active choice in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)

    Stakes (decoding language’s "living pulse") deepen through Mara’s agency, but the pressure lacks a tangible tightening; the crystal’s shift from resistance to cooperation feels earned yet lacks a visible price (e.g., physical toll or sacrificed insight) that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes ("capture sound of aging") deepen through sensory accumulation, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "inevitable tide" of forgetting lacks on-page demonstration like a specific memory loss. Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency (arranging markers, recording) aligns with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation via accumulating environmental pressure (shaking foundations, sound ribbons) narrows options to the leaf-sound trigger; cost legible in lifted centuries but agency-driven deepening is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) tightens via vinyl’s crackle "completing" the song, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mara’s actions feel predetermined rather than pressured choices. Cost (transformation over loss) is felt but not viscerally tied to her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency (proffering stones, using pendant as key), but the viral confession’s pressure dissipates too cleanly; the cost of healing feels diffuse rather than viscerally paid in her physical/emotional state during the transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (restore rites before moonrise) tightens via moon's ascent, with agency-driven escalation (lyre adjustments deepen ritual).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (sealing starlight) lacks concrete on-page test; 'world holding breath' urgency remains abstract without narrowing options. Escalation relies on internal rhythm, not external pressure. Cost (lifelong tending) is conceptual but not viscerally felt during the sealing act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes clear (capture wonder without imprisonment), but escalation flat—crystal insertion solves problem effortlessly. No narrowing of options or trade-off; "wounded season" never tests Corin with concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (releasing sorrow) remains abstract; no viscerally felt pressure or narrowing of options. Ritual mechanics ("air still as sea's depth") create procedural tension but lack emotional trade-offs or earned cost escalation beyond conceptual transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (containing grief) escalate through steam→sap hardening→glass pressing with visible cost in "invisible lines of time."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate via density (accumulating story fragments sharpening resolve), but Mara's agency falters—the ghost's memory offer lacks tangible cost, reducing the climax to thematic exchange rather than earned trade; the "regret" action shapes tension but doesn't visibly alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes signaled early ("resurrect hope"), but escalation lacks earned struggle—"careful calculations" handwaves challenge. No visible price paid; agency feels untested despite "maze of intentions" pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes ("preserve ancient methods") remain abstract despite knot-decoding tension; no credible cost (e.g., time loss, physical strain) materializes to narrow options or alter tactics during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes deepen through the traveler's realization that "work was never finished," but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; atmospheric shifts (shadows receding) complicate without narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake tightens through assembly process, but resolution violates accumulative lens: egg hatching requires zero cost (no failed attempts, resource loss). "Bitterly sweet" promise isn't paid in visceral tradeoffs—coincidence solves the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.7)
    No meaningful escalation under accumulative lens: the dominant stake ("scars can sing") faces no opposition or tactical shift—the villagers’ gratitude appears unearned, and the cloud migration timeframe exerts zero pressure on decisions, leaving stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (liberating memories) escalates via Mara’s agency: box resistance ("hinges tightening") forces patience, with cost in her identity shift. "Sticking force" intensification narrows options, but physical struggle lacks visceral weight during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (jagged scar vs. flowing grief) deepen through density accumulation, but protagonist agency falters—Eliam primarily observes while Mara directs ("Mara asked him"). Escalation lacks meaningful protagonist-driven tightening despite solid cost ("felt the weight") under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (restoring balance with the tide) tighten meaningfully during the pendulum's pause, narrowing Mara's options to incremental action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: luminous density intensifies from radio glow to dust-swirling cadence shift, narrowing Mara's world to transcription. Cost legible in "diligent work had become the bridge" – labor as irreplaceable currency for revival.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through ritual execution: "mirage of safety" dissolves into honest light as powder crystallizes emotion. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in mask shattering and "bittersweet reminder" of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as sediment analysis forces narrative convergence; the cost of sacrificing singular truth crystallizes in the earned renunciation, though external pressure could deepen the dominant stake beyond internal dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake ("create beauty from ruins") signaled early but lacks concrete opposition; vines cooperate instantly without struggle. Celestial alignment tightens time pressure but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page during key choices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure, but cost legibility falters: narrator’s catalytic role shift lacks visible forfeiture. "Sanctify" action redefines options yet avoids showing what’s sacrificed for this new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) is signaled early, but pressure remains atmospheric without meaningful escalation; the statue faces no opposition or trade-offs, and the "cost" (brine sigh) lacks visceral, felt consequence scaling to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes ("proving obstacles become instruments") deepen through cloud shifts (violet to amber to silver), but conflict lacks tangible opposition—the prophet faces no resistance beyond atmospheric changes. Escalation relies on environmental pressure rather than protagonist agency, with cost remaining abstract ("lingering hum") rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through pattern discoveries, but escalation lacks visible price. Agency in decoding patterns drives deepening, yet conceptual cost ("willingness to listen") feels abstract without tangible forfeiture. Missing Q4 9+ requirement for unmistakable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (rescuing truth from noble lies) tightens via Arlen's realization that the "shield had become a cage," forcing the high-stakes choice to dismantle narratives without destroying hope. Agency drives escalation as he draws parallels between kingdom and station, with visible cost in the lie's dissolution. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, though the timeframe element's urgency could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory against oblivion) intensifies via ink bleeding onto notes, but escalation lacks visceral weight—cost remains abstract ("rebellion") rather than concretely felt. Pressure builds coherently under Accumulative lens yet misses deeper trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (tracing origins) tightens via hypothesis refinement, but escalation lacks visible price—Mara’s breakthroughs feel frictionless. The sacrificial flood theory deepens knowledge, yet no tangible cost (time, physical strain) alters her tactics during the blackout’s pressure.

    Dominant stake (transforming grief) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening. Pressure comes from natural phenomena (shadow detachment), not agency—no meaningful tightening of options. "Luminous torment eases" presents unearned resolution without visible price paid. Band guardrail for 8.0+ fails: no foreclosed path or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten when the fissure appears: "unused potential" shifts from external hunt to internal state. Protagonist’s agency ("thrust his palm") drives escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is palpable in "bleak sky could no longer drown his resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (assembling "missing pieces") lacks tangible escalation; pressure rises through lyrical accumulation but cost remains conceptual. Agency in pulling lever is clear, yet no live option foreclosed or tactical shift occurs during the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes remain abstract ("backlash of regrets" as tidal wave) without visceral testing—no moment where regret physically impedes paddling; deepening occurs but cost lacks concrete pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)

    Stakes tighten via joy-induced weightlessness enabling the final stitch, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—pale wind breakthrough feels coincidental rather than earned by Nara's choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)

Fisherman’s appearance complicates via coincidence but fails to deepen pressure—his prophecy merely confirms rather than tests Mara’s motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (silent revolution) lacks escalation; blackout serves as vague atmosphere without live-clock pressure. Sunrise revealing the path feels coincidental, not earned through agency, with no visible price paid for the revolution's success.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes ("diffusing sorrow") remain static; pressure never escalates beyond the tutor’s predictable ritual. Each instruction step succeeds without complication, violating accumulative lens requirements for density increase or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.
