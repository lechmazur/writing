  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (rebuild her art and discover purpose) is signaled early. The ledger-guided journey provides one meaningful deepening when she finds the luminous shards, but escalation is passive: discoveries happen to her rather than being forced by her choices under mounting cost. No live option is foreclosed; the narrative accumulates glass-making steps without pressure that narrows tactics or imposes a visible trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and remains coherent. The act of opening the case, activating the device, and releasing the tone constitutes one meaningful deepening that reweights her survivor identity. Yet the escalation is largely internal and atmospheric; no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options with visible cost. The weeks-later summary of pilgrims adds thematic resonance but occurs off-page, and the visitors' pull is told rather than tested, reducing the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—giving restless souls a permanent address—is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or scarcity. Marlow places lens shards without impediment; no reversal narrows his options, and no visible price (stamina, tool failure, social cost) alters his tactics. The spirits' soft sighs and the library's glow constitute atmospheric response, not escalation with felt cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake is required; here the ending recycles prior imagery without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—feeding the community without drawing patrol attention—is declared but never tested on the page by an antagonistic force, scarcity event, or failed run. No reversal or tightening occurs; the first month succeeds off-stage, the volunteers smile "brighter," and new sacks appear with no cost, friction, or trade-off. Mara makes no decision that narrows options or forecloses a path. The story offers a series of successful repetitions (bell → volunteers → donations → pantry filled) without escalation, setback, or visible price. Agency is procedural rather than choice-driven under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (find and free unused love) is signaled early, but escalation occurs through smooth revelation rather than narrowing options or forcing tradeoffs. Milo encounters no resistance, failure, or competing cost; each breath and alignment simply works. The "reservoir not a pool but a lattice" moment functions as conceptual deepening, yet no on-page reversal forces a higher-stakes choice. The warm light eruption reads as wish fulfillment rather than earned under protagonist agency with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dominant stake ("dissolve the boundaries between memory and moment") is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens: Mara consults the halo fragment, drafts corridors, arranges photographs, and watches the child—each beat adds description without narrowing options, raising cost, or forcing a trade-off. The child's pause and the garden's bloom are coincidental responses, not protagonist-driven turns. No on-page reversal or deepening changes Mara's knowledge or forecloses a path; the maze's completion is declared rather than earned through visible struggle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieve seeds to avert famine—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piano-bench puzzle provides one meaningful tightening (a gate Mara must decode to proceed), and the final planting reweights prior material. Yet escalation is limited: each obstacle (bench, door) yields on first attempt without trade-offs or visible cost, and coincidence (the wall collapsing exactly when Mara emerges) resolves the vault's guardians off-page. The piece accumulates atmosphere but pressure does not compound through protagonist missteps or forced sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.6)
    The declared stake—imprinting memory into a device—faces no opposition, complication, or tightening. Mara sets up the forge, places coral, records a lullaby, completes the device, and returns; each step proceeds without friction or cost. No reversal narrows her options, no trade-off forces a hierarchy of values. The piece loops through collection and imprint beats without escalation, and the ending ("device sang...Mara smiled") restates the initial goal rather than dramatizing a choice or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—witness illuminated moments—never faces on-page opposition or cost. Lira encounters no locked door she cannot open, no time pressure, no trade-off between competing goods. The conductor hands her exactly what she needs; the moonbeams project a map; the jade door opens; the lantern ignites. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or forecloses a path. The final "promise" is asserted rather than earned through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is declared but never tested by a concrete reversal or complication; no scientist arrives, no ice threatens the workspace, no material runs short. Mara's sequence is a list of completed tasks without on-page opposition or tightening. The "abandon the notion that safety could be built quickly" reads as pre-resolved acceptance rather than a turn driven by new pressure. No visible cost or trade-off appears; the control panels flickering back to life is coincidental atmosphere, not consequence of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—overcoming fear to prove vulnerability is power—is declared but never tested on the page. The cipher-solving sequence functions as puzzle rather than escalating pressure; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option. The lever's potential collapse is defused without cost ("the hidden mechanism held"), undercutting any price. Agency is gestural assertion rather than decision with trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—drawing a map of endless night—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or reversal. The oracle's process (lifting booklet, exhaling to bind ink) unfolds without friction, narrowing, or visible cost; the storm provides ambiance but does not complicate tactics. The final map dissolution is asserted rather than earned by prior escalation, and the oracle's stance remains static ("stood unshaken"). No meaningful tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens; pressure is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (to find where thoughts come from), but escalation unfolds as a series of stated steps rather than dramatized choices with narrowing options. The robot's experiment with the violin—projecting memory, recording droplets, storing data—reads as procedural summary without a live reversal or tightening that forecloses a path. The ending declares synthesis achieved ("successfully amalgamated the echo of a thought"), yet no on-page cost or trade-off appears; the robot simply returns to sweeping with new awareness. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the piece never shows what the robot gave up or risked to reach that realization.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to thaw mistrust with transparency"—is declared early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Mara's sequence is linear (find tickets → use lens → project images → town understands). The resolution happens off-page when "the townsfolk gathered later" and "understood," with no protagonist agency, visible cost, or trade-off dramatized in scene. Coincidence (cryptic tickets left on a bench) initiates the action, and the lens solves the problem it did not help create, undercutting earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition. The marbles crack but polish effortlessly; the garden "trembles mildly" and grants a fountain; the maze crowns him without extracting cost. No reversal narrows options, no deepening changes knowledge, and coincidence (the garden's awareness) resolves rather than complicates. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, or Situational—escalation is absent and the protagonist's labor faces no friction that might foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—proving temporal drift—is signaled early but never endangered or escalated. Lira pulls the lever, the experiment succeeds on first attempt, and she records data without reversal, complication, or visible cost. No tightening narrows options; no alternative is foreclosed. Agency consists of a single unopposed action (lever pull) that succeeds perfectly, offering no trade-off, sacrifice, or earned endurance. The flora's "subdued awakenings" and birds' movements are consequences, not pressures that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: unravel the ghost's code and free the trapped melody. One tightening occurs when Mara plays the note and the water responds, narrowing her task to the final chord. However, escalation is gentle; no reversals or competing costs. The resolution (playing the final chord) feels more like fulfilling a ritual than a choice with trade-offs or risk. Agency is present but not tested by opposition or internal conflict. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and pursued through the illustration ritual and barometer adjustment. Pressure tightens once when the final reading stabilizes and "matched the weight of a stone," but this moment is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses an option. No reversal or complication tests Mirela's commitment; the sequence is additive (spread paper → smudge → adjust → read → resolve) without a turn that narrows tactics or raises cost. Agency is attention and interpretation rather than decision with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—quantifying hidden truth—is declared but never tested by a live on-page choice with alternatives and cost. No reversal or deepening narrows options; Mara appraises the wheel in summary, derives a pattern off-page, and decides to leave it without any friction or price paid. Coincidence (taped radio fragments, the foreman's confession) supplies all pressure; protagonist agency is observational throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: reach the refuge for regenerative silence. One meaningful tightening occurs (the descent through the fissure), and the keeper's agency is present (he chooses to burrow and step into the refuge). Cost, however, is abstract—"thoughts dissolve like ink"—without a visible forfeited option or tactical tradeoff. The phrase "silence births renewal" asserts resolution rather than showing a price paid or path foreclosed, leaving escalation functional but not viscerally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—nurturing wonder through music during the eclipse—is signaled early but never narrows options or imposes cost. Liora's adaptive melody proceeds without friction; no reversal tests her commitment, and the villagers' awe arrives as a gift rather than an earned outcome. The long-term coda (generations adopting the curl tradition) summarizes success without showing a trade-off or path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("collect the stories walls have heard") is signaled early but never tested. The historian encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, faces no cost. The descent, the vibration, the glyphs—all comply passively; he simply records. The "realignment" insight is delivered as summary epiphany without a reversal or tightening that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern-break or cadence shift; here the tone and method remain uniform from opening to close, offering atmospheric drift rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—embedding covert messages in fortune cookies—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity; the protagonist completes the task without friction, failure, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options: specs arrive, he applies them successfully, the visitor receives the message, end. The "accidental prophecies" that "spill the very secret they were meant to conceal" could generate internal conflict but remain abstract commentary. Closure claims a "quiet revolution" and "subtly rewired" lives off-page, offering no on-page cost or consequence. Agency is absent; the protagonist observes his own success rather than choosing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing the dimensional anchor's pull from consuming the priest's soul or shattering the veil—is signaled but never tested by an on-page choice that narrows options. The "clock of possession ticking" is mentioned but does not force a trade-off or escalate through protagonist agency. The loop pedal ritual deepens in description ("spiral of tonal prayer," "echo struck the core") yet the stillness shattering and possession waning are declared results rather than reversals driven by the priest's alteration or renunciation with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the accumulative lens that would foreclose a path or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Lian's ambition to conduct unheard symphonies—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The story tightens once, as dawn deepens and the nautilus pulses, releasing the wave that turns the frozen surface into vibrating chords, reweighting her longing into embodied conductor stance. However, there is no on-page opposition, reversal, or trade-off; the escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Agency is present in her ritual actions (aligning shell, sketching score, whispering command), but coincidence (the ice simply responds) completes the transformation without forcing a price under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake—"to conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal, no tightening choice that narrows options, no visible price paid after a turn. The protagonist's "acceptance" is told, not dramatized, and the procedural algorithm generates corridors off-stage without altering tactics. Escalation is absent; pressure flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled in the opening third. The escalation (placing needle → backward songs felt → rewind to forward songs → numbness dissolves) tightens once, meeting the one-meaningful-turn standard. Yet the turn feels procedural: Marin executes a remembered technique without visible trade-off or risk. No option is foreclosed, no credible loss appears; the drum maker's warning ("only when the silence is mirrored") is fulfilled as instruction, not dramatized constraint. The forward-song pressure "pressed against the filament" describes sensation but lacks a causal consequence that narrows Marin's next move.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—delivering truth past the quarantine—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Elara faces no live opposition or tactical dilemma on the page. The quarantine blocks human couriers, yet the hidden shaft solution appears without prior setup or visible trade-off. No reversal narrows her options; the closing vow and smile deflate rather than charge tension. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift, but the final beats repeat earlier tranquility rather than reconfiguring it.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") remains abstract and untested. Impossible choices are declared at forks (fireflies vs. lantern, release vs. tether) but never dramatized with visible tradeoffs or consequences. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—each beat repeats exploration and tracing without narrowing options or raising cost. The final choice to bind the rope carries no legible price because prior beats established no competing want or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unbinding silence to honor family storytelling tradition—is signaled early but never faces on-page friction. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful opposition appears; the violinist plays, the bowl sings, the hush lifts, and everyone understands. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing resists. The final act (playing a lingering refrain, walking away) carries no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight cost; here mood accumulates without escalation or agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—successfully harvesting and sealing the petal's emotional charge—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs: each step (rub petal, inhale fragrance, seal vial) proceeds without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. Mara encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and ends with unchanged options. The process is executed rather than tested, and coincidence does not complicate; the transformation simply "completes" on schedule. Agency is present in her method but does not foreclose a path or impose visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"uplift silent contributors"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Mara encounters zero resistance: the keeper cooperates, the fishermen volunteer stories the next morning, and the ceremony proceeds without friction. No reversal or tightening narrows options; each beat expands her project smoothly. The resolution lands through summary ("listeners felt a quiet surge of hope") rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. Coincidence (the misdelivered envelope) initiates action but convenience also resolves it, violating the lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—grafting oneself onto community—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. The shared search is declared as method but unfolds without obstacle, reversal, or visible cost. The villagers' participation is collective and frictionless; no individual resists, doubts, or forces Arlen to adjust. The final tapestry of reeds glows as announced, offering no surprise or trade-off. One tightening is promised but not delivered; escalation reads as accumulation without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where echoes are born"—is declared but never tested on the page; no ticking clock, rival, or sacrifice narrows options. The pendant unlocks a light bridge and releases echoes without resistance, cost, or complication. No meaningful escalation under any lens: pressure remains static from skiff to cavern, and the cavern "responded" conveniently. The resolution (restored rhythm, echoes reborn) is gifted by the setting rather than earned by protagonist agency. Coincidence (the pendant's automatic functions) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is declared but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or competing need. The conjurer faces no friction: the stone's cracks "sang softly," droplets obligingly translate loss into glowing numbers, and petals fall "like gentle rain" to return memory without cost. No tightening or deepening occurs; each step confirms his expectation rather than forcing adaptation. The "equation" (grief plus hope equals growth) is handed to him by the environment rather than earned through renunciation, error, or visible sacrifice. Coincidence and convenience resolve every beat without protagonist agency shaping outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—becoming visible to those who need help—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Maren's retrieval and placement of the tape fragment proceed without reversal, failure, or a moment where she must surrender another goal. The "flickering lights" nod toward urgency but impose no time pressure that alters tactics. No on-page tightening or deepening narrows options; the ending summarizes success rather than dramatizing a choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding reluctant metamorphosis—is signaled early but never opposed or tested. Marlowe's interventions succeed without friction: the copper coil works, the mycelium arrives, the leaf greens, the saplings thrive. No reversal, no tightening that forecloses an option. The "reluctant" label promises resistance but the leaf's change is smooth and "apologetic," a passive unfolding rather than a contested transformation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the final paragraph expands his practice without raising cost or narrowing tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance to the scarred world—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or constraint. Mara follows the trail, finds the brooch, places it, and the convergence occurs; no tightening choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "exchange" of paintings for the secret arrives without dramatized friction: we never see her hesitate, mourn the loss, or face a competing desire. The ending grants renewal without visible cost, undercutting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—Lira seeking the pearl to amplify miracles—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The pilgrim's arrival adds atmospheric pressure but no escalation; Lira's whisper is granted without cost, and the cave's response is benevolent throughout. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the narrative drifts through accumulative beats without a pressure point that forces a trade-off or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments into coherent meaning—is signaled early and sustained. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs: the archivist gathers fragments, the valve hums, the community responds, and he sets out again without a visible trade-off or narrowed option. The "distant shout" at the end introduces a new call rather than escalating prior pressure. Coincidence (the shout) complicates but does not test; the archivist answers "without hesitation," signaling no internal conflict or cost. One meaningful pressure point under the Accumulative lens is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—"to find the fortress of unspoken truths"—is declared early but never tested by a reversal that narrows options. Each arrow and unlock proceeds as scripted discovery with no complication or trade-off: she kneels, she presses, the lock clicks. The final ledger's reveal is accumulative rather than a tightening, and no visible price (time, stamina, social cost) alters her tactics. The piece opts for situational pressure (she must dare beyond her maps) but never crystallizes a stance under conflicting goods or harms. Coincidence (the phantom punch always pulses correctly) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"sculpt space for reflection"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No reversal or tightening appears; Lira sits, the tile glows, she writes, she closes her notebook. The whales' migration unfolds in parallel but does not complicate her task. No on-page cost is paid; no live option is foreclosed. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should narrow options, but the piece moves in steady descriptive accretion without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping boredom by discovering what lies after goodbye—is signaled early. The corridor sequence provides accumulative pressure, but escalation remains textural rather than tightening options with visible cost. The twin's whispered insight offers deepening, yet the immortal's final "quiet resolve" and forward step lack a trade-off or foreclosed path. Pressure coheres but does not force a choice with legible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving her lineage to asylum officials via a fair-trade contract—is signaled early but never tightened by on-page opposition or failure. Mara waits, whispers the formula, and the ink complies without friction, cost, or reversal. The mourners' grief and the room's atmosphere accumulate pressure texturally, but no live choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending asserts that "the fairness she sought could not be imposed by law alone" yet no prior beat dramatizes that insight through failed attempt or sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens the piece aims for, one meaningful deepening that reweights cost is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.6)
    No discernible escalation or reversal. The stationer's goal (collect textures, write histories) is stated early and simply repeated in varied phrasing throughout; nothing narrows options, raises cost, or forces a trade-off. The ending announces readiness to continue the same action indefinitely ("ready to refract another day"), making the entire piece a static tableau. Even under an Accumulative lens, no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake—only synonym churn around the same premise.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is declared but never endangered or tested through reversal. No on-page tightening narrows options: the label glows, projects stories, and the narrator absorbs them without obstacle, refusal, or trade-off. Coincidence (the tide surge revealing numbers) delivers the payoff rather than protagonist agency. The resolution ("I would keep gathering") restates intent without visible cost or altered capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("decode a universal riddle") is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the shell glows, the cello hums, the ledger reveals verses, and the answer unfolds without resistance. Selene's agency is observation and placement; no decision forecloses an option or incurs visible cost. Coincidence resolves: props appear exactly when needed, undermining causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake—prevent privatization by reorganizing the carnival—is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Mira discovers the chip, instructs illustrators, and shifts stalls in a smooth sequence with no on-page resistance, miscalculation, or tactical cost. The investors "prepare legal briefs" off-stage and arrive only to witness the fait accompli; no confrontation or reversal tests Mira's commitment. The council's postponement is told rather than shown, and no prior choice is foreclosed—Mira retains loyalty to both dock workers and carnival soul without visible sacrifice. Agency reads as coordination rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (photograph the grain before dawn reclaims it) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or narrowing. The inspector calibrates, sets the tripod, waits—each step proceeds as planned without reversal or tightening choice. The "tremor of grief" and solace are named emotions, not decisions that foreclose a path. No visible cost alters later tactics; the mission succeeds as briefed, and the descent is epilogue rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the patch so the drone can navigate—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. The repair succeeds smoothly; no reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows options. The anchor's rising and the ship's departure run parallel to Mara's task without intersecting causally. Agency is limited to execution without renunciation or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—mapping the rivers' origin—is signaled early and tightens through discovery of the condensation route, transmitter activation, and the bell's toll. Pressure accumulates under the accumulative lens, but Mara faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; the transmitter works, the signal bursts forth, and the thaw unfolds on cue. The tightening is atmospheric rather than agonistic, and no visible cost (stamina, tool failure, social price) alters her tactics. One clean deepening without friction or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.7)
    A dominant stake is signaled (restore the town), but no complication or reversal tests it; the tuner imagines footsteps, the fork hums, stones slide into place, workers arrive, done. No on-page narrowing of options, no trade-off or visible price paid, no choice that forecloses an alternate path. The escalation requirement under any lens is unmet, and coincidence (sunrise, workers' arrival) drives events rather than protagonist agency. Without pressure or cost, the piece remains a sequence rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the vial to share its power—is signaled early but never truly tightened. The "price" the temple demands is surrendering the beacon, yet this costs Mara nothing on the page; she surfaces unharmed, keeps the vial, and fulfills her goal. No reversal narrows options; the bioluminescent fish spell "unsnarl" but don't force a trade-off. The resolution is not earned by protagonist sacrifice—luck and temple beneficence solve everything. Coincidence (the temple's generosity) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("chasing hush," redemption from false alarms) is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The boy encounters no resistance; the lattice provides powers without cost, the map appears conveniently, and bodies rise "in grateful silence" without conflict. No on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path; coincidence (fog, glowing map) advances plot without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the bride moves through a predetermined sequence without agency or trade-off. The final act (releasing a sigh) resolves nothing she struggled against. Coincidence and metaphor substitute for escalation; no persistent constraint shapes her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—stitching hope into the labyrinth—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle, setback, or complication forces the weaver to adapt; each step succeeds as declared. "Broken precedents" are mentioned as already crumbled under her "soft insistence," offering no on-page resistance. The piece cycles through nightly sewing and morning confirmations without a single moment where failure, doubt, or external pressure narrows options or raises cost. Agency is absent; the weaver acts in a vacuum of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early and pursued through gathering fragments and placing the sundial base. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last stone clicks and the voice rises, but no mid-sequence reversal tests commitment; Mara encounters no obstacle, misalignment, or tactical cost that forces a trade-off. The roots recoil and bones rattle in response to her action, yet she never risks error, exhaustion, or a competing need. Escalation reads as atmospheric accumulation rather than narrowing options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the margins"—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, cost, or tightening emerges; Mara performs a sequence of ritual steps (paint symbols, trace code, place envelope) that succeed without friction. The drone's arrival and letter's vibration are presented as automatic outcomes rather than choices that narrow options. One micro turn or deepening under any lens is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the conspiracy before the coup—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The embroiderer encounters no obstacle, makes no tightening choice that forecloses an option, and faces no visible antagonist or complication. The progression is linear: she stitches, interprets the flame, finishes, and dispatches the chart without a reversal or cost that narrows her path. The "adjacent possibilities" visions are recounted summaries, not dramatized pressure points. No on-page escalation or agency-driven turn alters tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—releasing unsent letters—is signaled early but never tested. The protagonist moves through the labyrinth unopposed; spirits assist, moonlight heals, and condensation forms on cue. No reversal or tightening narrows options; each beat restates the same ritual without escalation. The breeze that scatters the letters might function as a complication, but spirits immediately catch and preserve them, erasing any cost. Resolution is convenience, not earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dominant stake ("unknot the tangled narratives") is signaled early but never tested. The translator faces no opposition, dilemma, or cost; the child is asleep, the notes glow "faintly" and become legible without effort. No reversal or tightening occurs; the anesthetic deepening is a passive timer, not a pressure point that forces choice. The final "droplet" sealing is coincidental resolution with no prior setup or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—illuminating the orchard—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition or cost. The artist works unimpeded; passersby gather and smile, the fog thins, and the mural succeeds without a reversal, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is absent: she executes a plan without renunciation, endurance under pressure, or a choice that forecloses a live option. The story offers outline progression ("she worked," "she added," "she stepped back") without escalation under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. The garden responds obligingly to Lena's whisper and tap; no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece describes escalation ("nested awakenings multiplied," "ripples through the sound") without dramatizing a moment where Lena must choose between competing goods or endure a loss. Agency is absent; she observes and reacts, but coincidence (the coin sparking, the pedestal emitting a tone) drives all movement. The ending smile and departure lack the weight of a decision that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting the "spark of defiance"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a live on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Dr. Mirabel's arrival could threaten exposure, yet she immediately aligns without conflict. The resolution is collaborative expansion rather than earned agency with visible cost. Coincidence (Mirabel's curiosity aligning) resolves tension rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.4)
    A single stake is declared early—convert pain into beauty—but it faces no opposition, reversal, or trade-off. The postcard arrives, the poet sings, the nebulae bloom; each step is additive prophecy, not escalation under pressure. No on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a choice with visible cost. The centuries of longing dilute urgency, and the child-finds-shell coda resets rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—"to preserve the sound of forgotten names"—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, complication, or tightening narrows options; the caretaker performs her ritual nightly without interruption until a traveler conveniently arrives. The traveler's departure does not alter her resources, tactics, or emotional stance. Agency is observation and repetition without renunciation or visible cost, leaving escalation absent and closure inert.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no opposition, resource limit, or internal conflict; each glyph releases its secret on cue. The "timeframe: before paths diverge" creates no ticking clock, and the transcription's success feels inevitable rather than earned through a tightening choice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting values—is declared but never tested on the page. Mira faces no opposition, complication, or reversal; the floodgate works immediately, and the elder's conversion is frictionless. No tightening, trade-off, or visible price accompanies the resolution. Agency (turning the wheel, whispering to the stone) is present but uncontested, reducing pressure to a procedural sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is signaled but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Lila's actions (mapping dust, attaching meteorite slivers, releasing pigeons) proceed without opposition, failure, or visible price. The ending declares success ("the map she had drawn glows faintly") with no on-page cost or foreclosed path. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating, and coincidence (the meteorite chip's hum, the pigeons' mirrored flight) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the exit or understanding sacred thresholds—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the child intuits the code, the panel opens, the maps glow, the path is revealed without friction. Agency is passive throughout: the child "felt," "sensed," "intuitively understood" without making a choice that forecloses an alternative. The resolution (becoming a threshold guardian) is announced rather than earned, with no visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake is announced abstractly ("learn the rhythm of belonging") but never tested with a concrete trade-off or narrowing of options. The piece declares escalation ("the walls resonated," "water rippled in perfect synchrony") without dramatizing a reversal, choice, or tightening that forecloses a live path. Aria's agency is entirely receptive—she whispers, places the feather, plays instruments—and the city responds with convenient communion; no coincidence complicates, but neither does protagonist decision drive pressure. The ending delivers no visible cost or stance crystallization, only mood and intention.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early but never faces meaningful escalation or opposition. Each seed press yields the expected hue without resistance; the fissure accepts the final seed and the bridge reappears as forecast. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Maren's agency consists of a linear sequence of actions (collect, press, step forward) that encounter no complication. The "cheerful gloom" label recurs but does not modulate under pressure. The resolution arrives through task completion rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake—"serenade monotony with creativity"—is signaled but never tested. Pressure is atmospheric, not escalating: each act (juggling fire, riddles, violin) demonstrates mastery without opposition or trade-off. The ink-X and music are interpretations, not turns that narrow options. Coincidence (tide, audience giggle) complicates texture but does not deepen conflict. No on-page reversal or tightening choice forecloses a path; the performer exits having satisfied himself and his audience without visible cost or agency shift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin"—is signaled early but never opposed or tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication narrows Lira's path; she finds the speck, learns the method, executes the verse, and succeeds without visible cost or trade-off. The prose declares escalation ("deepening," "final stroke") but plot pressure remains flat: luck and competence align with no friction. Agency at closure is absent; the ink "pulsed like a heartbeat" and "word spread" are outcomes, not choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"illuminate value in the mundane"—is signaled but never tested by opposition, doubt, or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the ritual proceeds smoothly from toss to gratitude without friction. Mira's agency is observation and appreciation, not decision or renunciation. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid. Pressure is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—translating pain into a universal language—is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma or reversal. Maren's walk proceeds without opposition, and the box-opening at the village resolves her goal through a miraculous transformation (light falls, box turns whole) rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. No tightening occurs; the text loops thematic claims (bargain, innocence, enlightenment, scars as lenses) without escalation or agency. The villagers' wide-eyed reception is summary, not dramatized friction, and Maren walks away unchanged, rendering the closure passive and the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring communal hope via the altitude gauge mystery—is signaled early but never tightened through reversal or forced trade-off. Trials proceed smoothly: balloons rise, the needle traces arcs, equations "finally align" at zero without prior failure or visible cost. Agency is notional; Arin observes and records rather than deciding under pressure. No on-page escalation or deepening forecloses a path, leaving conflict abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: discovering and honoring the walls' dreams. One meaningful deepening occurs when the walls "exhale a low hum," signaling resonance. Yet the escalation is largely textural; no reversal or trade-off narrows Lira's options. The final "shared communion" resolves the stake without visible cost—scholars arrive, tokens accumulate, burden lifts—undercutting the pressure. Agency is present but never foreclosed; no price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.4)
    The stated stake—"to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"—is never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows options; the painter's work proceeds unopposed to an effortless outcome. Children and bells appear as ambient texture without applying pressure. Cost is absent: the protagonist achieves his goal without sacrifice, failure, or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—achieving peace between warring clans—is signaled early but remains abstract; no specific clan grievance or tactical obstacle is dramatized. One tightening occurs when the first chieftain steps forward, yet his capitulation arrives without visible internal cost or prior resistance that the text must overcome. Pressure is coherent under a situational lens but lacks a meaningful reversal or trade-off that forecloses a live option. The resolution (swords laid down) reads as convenient convergence rather than agency-driven escalation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the extinct bird's echo—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The protagonist's plan proceeds without a single reversal, tightening, or moment where failure is risked on the page. The "lull" of thunder provides a timing cue, not a pressure point; no agency decision forecloses a path or alters tactics. The weeks-later discovery by scientists is summary, not dramatized escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake: defy the lullaby of conformity by unlocking the sanctuary. One meaningful tightening: the final golden thread releases, sanctuary erupts, city's lullaby shatters. Yet the escalation unfolds without visible trade-offs or persistent constraints shaping tactics; the courtesan untangles threads with patient grace but no on-page friction or cost that narrows options. Agency at closure is present (she releases the strand) but the consequence—city awakening—is told rather than shown through a protagonist choice that forecloses a path with felt price. Coincidence does not resolve, but the resolution feels abstract rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Selene faces no opposition, makes no trade-off, and encounters no reversal; the dome visit is a contemplative interlude in which her convictions are restated rather than pressured. The "heated argument" in the tavern is backstory, not dramatized conflict. No meaningful escalation under any lens: no causal tightening (no decision narrows options), no accumulative deepening (no pattern break reweights cost), no situational crystallization (no stance forced by coherent pressure). Agency is absent; she rehearses future intentions without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to honor overlooked histories"—is declared but never tested. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal friction opposes Lira's goal; she collects, knots, and places without reversal or tightening. The "interrupted cadence" and "temporary structures" are conceptual, not pressure points. No choice forecloses a path or imposes visible cost. The ritual completes exactly as intended, offering thematic resonance without escalation or agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early but never tested or narrowed. Mara encounters no opposition, failed attempt, or forced trade-off; she simply succeeds. The traveler's arrival adds accumulation but not escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the final paragraph repeats the opening conceit without reweighting cost or options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal tightens options; instead, the wafer seal pulses, the spores respond, and the vortex lifts everything into "renewal" without resistance or cost. The storm's approach provides atmospheric escalation but does not force a difficult choice or alter her tactics. Agency is minimal: she places the seal, whispers gratitude, and the world transforms in her favor.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant to bind star-watching to cosmic ledger—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when Nabu aligns tile numbers with planetary positions, yet this choice is frictionless: no dramatized obstacle, no visible price paid mid-scene. The ritual's success is immediate and complete ("the covenant sealed with a gentle click"), foreclosing tension rather than escalating it. The story lacks a moment where a live option is visibly surrendered or a trade-off forces tactical change. Agency is present (Nabu performs the ritual) but pressure does not cohere into a narrowing or deepening that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (releasing resentment) is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Kovan touches the box and immediately softens, then the monks repeat in lockstep summary. The wanderer's conversion duplicates the pattern without escalation. Mara faces no opposition, risk, or trade-off—her scheme succeeds without friction. Pressure is static, and the resolution is delivered by the music box's convenience rather than protagonist agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early, but no reversal or complication appears. Each step of Arlen's ritual (alignment, synchronized breathing, chanting) succeeds without adjustment or cost. The dream "slipped from the horizon" and was "pulling…into the glass" by authorial fiat, not protagonist agency or a forced trade-off. The resolution grants success without a visible price, narrowing of options, or an earned turn. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here the rhythm remains uniform and no tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—repairing fractured quartz lenses—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when the ribbon snag sparks the mending idea, but the escalation is cognitive rather than pressure-driven; no live option is foreclosed. The final assembly ("each tiny incision glowed") proceeds without reversal or visible price. Under Accumulative lens expectations, the lack of a deepening that changes options or a cost legible in the closure beat caps the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge via the cameo—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the great-grandmother's vision explains the key paradox, changing the curator's understanding. However, this revelation arrives through convenient exposition rather than protagonist agency under pressure. No live option is foreclosed; the curator encounters no meaningful resistance or trade-off. The final act (pressing the cameo) feels like ritual completion rather than a choice that narrows possibilities with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the library—is declared but never endangered or deepened by reversal. Selene encounters no resistance; the floor opens, the lock yields, the scrolls appear. No on-page tightening narrows her options, and no visible cost forecloses a path. The time traveler's nod and the portal's appearance are setup moves, not escalation, leaving pressure inert throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("recapture the scattered verses…find the garden") is declared early but never tested on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs: the protagonist inserts the card into a slot, dives into ink, and the verses glow on the card without opposition or trade-off. The "portal opened" and "river of ink" deliver solutions rather than complications. The ending grants all stated goals—assembled map, blossoms gathered, lights restored—without visible price or foreclosed path. Under any lens, escalation is absent and agency is decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—solving the door's paradox—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains thin: Mara faces no visible obstacle, no reversals, no cost that narrows her options. The vault lock "yields with a sigh," the rope unfurls, the braids align on the first attempt. Pressure accumulates through descriptive density rather than through protagonist agency or trade-offs. The closure reconfigures meaning (absence as bridge), yet the cost is conceptual—time frozen, door vanished—without a legible personal sacrifice or foreclosed path for Mara on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restore quiet to the caves—is signaled early and remains coherent. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the search and the stone's deployment; the energy beings' retreat and the ice smoothing mark a tightening. However, the mapkeeper encounters no setback, alternate tactic, or live trade-off; he moves from observation to retrieval to placement without friction. The cost at closure (ongoing vigilance) is told rather than dramatized, and no prior option is visibly foreclosed by the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (prove coincidences have meaning) is declared early but never tightened by a reversal or forced choice. The rekindling sequence unfolds without friction: the prism is placed, the shard hums, the beacon lights—each step a success without cost or complication. The caravan arrival introduces a new goal (map the network) that replaces rather than escalates the original stake. No protagonist agency forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to sculpt identity from experience"—is asserted but never tested by a live option that would force the archivist to choose or forfeit something on the page. The conjecture about collective memory is proposed, then restated in synonym loops without escalation, contradiction, or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; the shadow measurement and crystal's whisper are described but do not alter his tactics or knowledge. The ending returns him to the starting stance ("ready to sculpt new identities") without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma or trade-off. The designer encounters no obstacle, resistance, or cost; the firework simply "erupts," the mosaic glows, and hopelessness lifts. No reversal or tightening narrows options. The vow at the end functions as a static resolve rather than a stance earned by prior escalation. Agency is observation and performance without forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—foreseeing the outcome of a dawn meeting—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the chronicler simply observes ripples and hears an owl, then the leaders soften their tones off-stage. She makes no decision that narrows options or incurs a trade-off. The "transition period" unfolds passively, resolved by the jade cicada's vibration rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (collect pure silence-flavors) is signaled early and tightens through the limiting-exposure tactic that prevents filament-tangling. The hour-inversion provides one meaningful pressure window. Yet escalation is thin: Lio places the doll, whispers, watches filaments grow, retrieves it—no reversal or choice under conflicting pressure. The cost (limiting exposure) is explained rather than tested; no on-page moment where Lio must sacrifice an option or endure loss to preserve purity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort wandering minds—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or tightening. Lira executes her method without resistance, error, or adaptation; no credible opposition or internal friction appears. The storm glass vial "burst into a cascade of silver" without causal trigger or cost, reading as ambient event rather than earned escalation. Agency is absent; Lira observes and facilitates but does not make a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the stairway before sunrise—is declared but never tested. Mina encounters no meaningful obstacle; each step reveals the next clue without resistance. The sunrise deadline dissolves without urgency; she ascends, claims the throne, and *then* sunrise breaks with no cost for delay. No reversal, no tightening that narrows options. Agency is observation, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("teach the suffocating darkness to breathe") is signaled early but remains metaphorical; no on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. "Burning bridges carefully" is mentioned twice yet never dramatized as a choice with visible consequence; the keeper lays embers "as a token" without agency cost. The threshold "responds" without the protagonist's decision driving escalation. No reversal or deepening changes options or knowledge under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—translating pressure into diamonds—is signaled early but never endangered or tested. No on-page failure or resistance forces the narrator to adjust tactics; the glitchy messages provide step-by-step instructions, the bolt is placed, and the outcome succeeds immediately. The "past entanglements" are invoked as thematic parallel but do not create present friction or trade-off. Cost is asserted ("turned a tool of oppression") rather than paid in a forfeited option or visible consequence. The escalation promised by rising pressure is told, not dramatized through reversal or narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early but never tightened or deepened. Lian turns the crank, hears the pattern, lifts the floorboard, and reads the scroll without friction, reversal, or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the gramophone delivers exactly what he hoped for with no trade-off or complication. The confession about betrayal arrives as information dump rather than a pressure point that alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake, "to capture the shape of possibility," is declared but never tested on the page through a choice between competing goods or a visible trade-off. The knight encounters no meaningful resistance: the control panel yields, the vapor obeys, the script unfurls, and the orchard responds in harmony. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the progression is additive (and-then vapor, and-then spores, and-then constellations) without escalation or cost under the Accumulative lens. Agency is passive observation and gesture rather than decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring forgotten voices—is signaled early but never tested. No tightening occurs: the supervisor agrees without friction, and the next file arrives with the same pattern. Amelia's agency consists of hoping and presenting; she faces no trade-off, no resource limit, no cost that alters tactics. The story moves through accumulation (button → dust → silhouettes → report → display) without a reversal, deepening, or moment where a live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—broadcasting truth to awaken resistance—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful obstacle or trade-off. Mara's plan proceeds without friction: the map appears, the platform is found, the key fits, the transmission succeeds. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; no visible cost (stamina, exposure, ally sacrifice) alters her tactics. The "tyranny of indifference" is abstract antagonism with no on-page agent or consequence that Mara must navigate. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the piece loops through similar imageried beats without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—hush the prophecy to prevent a storm—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening alters the protagonist's options; he plays, the code dissolves, the valley sleeps. The prophesied storm never materializes as a live threat, so the resolution lacks felt cost. Agency is present (he chooses to whisper, not roar) but the trade-off is declared, not dramatized. The piece never forces a choice between competing goods or shows a visible price paid after a turn that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or scarcity. Each step (prod, glow, pool, tower) succeeds without complication; no reversal or tightening narrows options. The ending offers no visible cost: Lira's final leaf placement and the dust cascade feel ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. Coincidence drives discovery (the pool appears when prodded, the leaf lands on the monument, the dust ignites) without agency shaping outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's search for meaning in broken relics—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma with visible cost. The compass points, she follows, discovers inscription, and accepts its lesson without resistance or sacrifice. No reversal or narrowing occurs; coincidence (courier delivery, leaf swirl, needle swing) propels each step rather than protagonist agency under opposition. The brazier scene could provide escalation but instead delivers thematic conclusion without a prior climb or trade-off. Pressure remains static rather than accumulating toward a choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the weight of names via kintsugi repair—is signaled early but never truly tested. The gold flows obediently when she whispers the dragon's name; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The narrative claims redemption is "a continuous negotiation with the limits she set upon herself," yet the on-page action is smooth success. The search party's disbandment is mentioned as context but does not apply pressure; coincidence does not complicate, and agency is minimal. One meaningful escalation is absent under the Accumulative lens, and no visible cost narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—healing spectral confessions—is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or complication. Mara encounters no resistance; the joke succeeds immediately without risk or trade-off. The transformation of spirits happens passively ("emerged a wave of luminous laughter") rather than through protagonist agency under pressure. One micro-turn (tooth hums → joke → laughter) provides modest escalation, but no visible cost alters later tactics or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is declared early but never faces on-page opposition or cost. The forest's "ultraviolet penance" (flashes of light that sear skin) is mentioned but never dramatized as a trade-off that alters her approach. The climactic equation ("mercy equals the sum of understood suffering divided by the willingness to remember") is whispered and the forest immediately softens, erasing pressure rather than escalating it. No reversal, no tightening choice, no visible price paid. The ending grants understanding without forcing Lira to forfeit or endure anything concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the lighthouse memory—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The protagonist encounters no resistance, makes no difficult choice, and pays no visible price. The "patterns converge" and the chain "unfastens itself" through coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The ending dissolves stakes into sentimental promise without foreclosing a path or altering tactics. One brief tightening (studying paintings to align them) is present but does not escalate or deepen with trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mara's investigation deepens (dust → sound → attic → ledger) but never tightens into a choice that forecloses an option or imposes cost. The spirits cooperate, the tools work, and the reveal arrives without complication or reversal. No meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens; the story adds layers without narrowing possibilities or charging the final image with sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—"compress eternity into a moment"—is signaled early but remains abstract and faces no on-page test that narrows options. No reversal or tightening choice; Mara proceeds from bottle to press to completion without friction, failure, or adaptation. The rupture is described as "destabilize perfect systems," yet no credible resistance or cost appears—books slip, panes crack, but these are scenic events, not obstacles she must overcome or prices she pays. Agency is procedural execution, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—cultural renaissance vs. archaeological dispute—is signaled early but never tightens. Lira devises a plan; the plan works; no reversal or cost appears on the page. The elders' "arguments softened" without dramatized concession or trade-off; visitors arrive as consequence rather than complication. Agency is absent: the storm, mirrors, and shard perform the work while Lira watches. The resolution lacks visible cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (silencing the sorrowful note) is signaled early but never escalates. Alder's repair proceeds without reversals, failed attempts, or visible trade-offs. The covenant's threat to "wilt near dishonesty" is told but never tested on the page. Agency is procedural rather than decision-driven; the central gear "clicks into place" without cost or friction. No meaningful tightening forecloses a live option or forces a choice that reweights tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding "the place where explanations fail"—is abstract and never tested on the page by a live obstacle or trade-off. The descent unfolds as a series of granted thresholds: the compass points, the water accepts her weight, the crystal chimes, the vortex pulls the compass into its core. No reversal forces Mara to sacrifice, choose between competing goods, or alter her approach. The "hinges of reality shifting" is declared, not dramatized, and the resolution ("quiet surrender") is conceptual rather than a visible cost that forecloses a path. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming driftwood into story—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a trade-off that narrows options. No reversal or deepening occurs; Mira gathers wood, carves, and succeeds without friction. The crowd's "unseen pull" is told in summary, not dramatized as a choice-altering consequence. Agency is present as action but not as decision under pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"why do flowers bloom at night?"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never crystallizes into a choice with competing goods or unavoidable harms. The cathedral sequence presents a vision rather than a reversal that narrows options; the protagonist observes a spectacle and departs with declarative understanding, no visible price paid or path foreclosed. No escalation or deepening occurs; pressure does not tighten through protagonist agency. The ending asserts transformation ("her heart humming with a new rhythm") without demonstrating a trade-off or tactic shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering suppressed histories—is declared early but never tested by a live trade-off or obstacle that forces Mara to choose between competing goods. The parley with Qadir is resolved off-page ("agreed only if"), the retrocognitive cipher is decoded via a chronometer with no dramatized attempt or failure, and the final broadcast encounters no resistance. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the plot advances by assertion. The ending claims "countless suppressed voices lift" but no on-page cost (time, safety, alliance, resource) is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.4)
    No escalation under any lens: the alchemist conceives a plan, executes it mentally, and succeeds without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. Stakes are declared ("revival," "reimagine an entire civilization") but never tested—no resource limit, no failure forcing adjustment, no competing claim. The "rejection of false comfort" is told twice but never dramatized as a live choice with a visible price. The final image recycles the opening lantern motif without deepening pressure or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled but remains abstract and does not tighten on the page. The prophecy arrives accidentally via the phonograph, yet Harel's response is contemplation rather than a choice that narrows options or raises cost. No meaningful escalation occurs: the scribe's realization that the child will be a future archivist loops back to his existing mission without altering tactics or foreclosing a path. The ending records the prophecy with no visible price paid or option sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—reopening the covenant—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or internal conflict. Mira performs each step (lift cap, place it, plant seed) without a credible reversal, tightening, or cost that forecloses an option. The phoenix's transformation and the atrium's response happen passively around her. No price is paid; the vortex simply "settles within her" and the ending grants "wild serenity" without visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: install the sensor successfully to let the sanctuary "hear the true voice of the storm." The glue-drying wait is the only mild tension point; once dried, the protagonist connects the cable without reversal or complication. Zero hour arrives, the bell performs as hoped, and visitors respond on cue. No tightening forecloses a live option; no visible price alters tactics. Pressure remains static rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring fallen stars—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options: the janitor traces paths, whispers a vow, the station records it, and morning "arrives within" without cost. The tremor and the station's chord are responses from the world, not choices by the protagonist that foreclose alternatives. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; here the texture remains uniform from opening to close, and no price is paid or trade-off forced.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.5)
    No on-page escalation or tightening occurs. The dominant stake—preserving the weight of unspoken words—is declared but never tested by a choice that narrows options. The recluse performs the same contemplative gazing throughout with no reversal, no complication that forces a trade-off, and no visible cost. The final act of placing the box and aligning it with the sun is ceremonial, not a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscover the capsule's purpose before time runs out—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal, tightening, or visible cost. Mara's sequence of actions (scour ledger → find phrase → uncover hourglass → fit fragment) proceeds without complication, failed attempt, or forced trade-off. The hourglass metaphor ("last grain of sand") is declared but never shown to impose urgency on tactics. Agency is passive discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and the resolution grants fulfillment without dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—"to discover beauty in the incomplete"—is declared rather than tested. No escalation occurs: the poet performs the same harmonizing action throughout (whisper verses, place feather, arrange pebbles) without rising opposition or cost. The kite-string snap appears twice as atmospheric texture but never tightens the poet's options or forces a trade-off. Agency is absent; the lagoon "responds" and "brightens" passively, granting the poet success without struggle. No reversal or deepening narrows options or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (foster interspecies respect before death) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal occurs; Mara wraps copper, the orchard hums, visitors pause, children sketch—a sequence of affirmations without friction. The six-month limit never narrows options or forces a trade-off. Escalation is absent; pressure remains flat. The council's decree-lifting is external gift, not earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Arin's stated mission—"to understand the chemistry of homecoming"—provides a dominant stake signaled early, but it remains abstract and unchallenged by concrete obstacles or trade-offs. The "low vibration" from the tower and the scholars' observation create atmospheric pressure without narrowing Arin's options or forcing a choice with visible cost. The final realization is delivered through summary ("realized that the chemistry of homecoming was not a formula but a dialogue") rather than a dramatized escalation or reversal driven by protagonist agency. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs (the tower's pulse matching the amber's signature), but the protagonist does not alter tactics or forfeit a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—fertilize the jetty to reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication arises; the coachman listens, decodes, scatters, and succeeds exactly as planned. Agency is execution, not choice; no want conflicts with fear, no coincidence complicates, no visible price alters tactics. The mission proceeds along a straight line from arrival to completion with no moment where options narrow or cost becomes legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—connecting separated souls via the waxed leaf—is signaled early. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Rook finds the cylinder, decodes it, retrieves the leaf, and reseals it in a linear sequence without complication or trade-off. The leaf's promise is fulfilled immediately with no dramatized cost or failed attempt. Agency is observational rather than decisional; coincidence (the leaf lying ready in an open chest) solves the quest without protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—to find direction after shutdown—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the vision arrives as a gift, the sketch aligns, and the protagonist records it without friction. The second anniversary paragraph adds another sketch with no obstacle, and the walls "glow" in confirmation. Agency is observation and transcription, not decision under pressure. Escalation is absent; coincidence delivers both the vision and the map "of possibilities."

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—amending a centuries-old curse—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Lysander encounters no resistance, misstep, or moment where his method fails and forces a tactical shift. Each chess piece is swapped in sequence without friction, the ice obligingly softens, and the curse lifts as if on schedule. The piece lacks a meaningful reversal or deepening; pressure is declared (the chill, the sighing wind) but not dramatized through a choice that narrows options or imposes a visible cost. The ending distributes closure across descent, village greeting, market display, and the next adventure, diluting any single moment of escalation or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled: to unbind memory and record small gestures. The walking pattern → scroll discovery → second pattern offers a sequence, but no reversal or tightening; each step succeeds without friction, and the "nomadic penumbra" curls protectively rather than opposing. The hidden compartment click and scroll content are coincidental discoveries that solve the problem they did not help create. No trade-off or visible price is enacted; Mira's final peace arrives as reward rather than consequence of a choice that foreclosed another path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the shape of home"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening occurs; each beat (feather on stone, corridor unfurls, book opens, scent of home) adds texture without narrowing options or raising cost. The resolution is handed to Lira by the stone and book rather than earned by her agency. Coincidence (stone's song, book's revelation) resolves the quest without protagonist decision, renunciation, or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early, but escalation is contemplative rather than forced by narrowing options. The tutor enters, reflects, arranges stones, visualizes, then releases—each beat deepens mood without introducing a tangible obstacle or trade-off. The labyrinth is described as a test ("winnow the soul") yet no wrong turn, puzzle failure, or sacrifice appears on the page. Cost at closure ("let go of the pawn") is metaphorical and uncontested; no live alternative is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—earning forgiveness through art—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Mara gathers townsfolk, paints, and speaks; each beat repeats the same tactic (refraction via poetry/art) without escalation, reversal, or a trade-off that narrows options. The "price" is named repeatedly but never tested: no on-page choice forces Mara to forfeit a competing good or accept a visible loss. The ritual arrives as backdrop, not as a tightening clock that alters her tactics. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency also does not drive a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows options; the alchemist's narration succeeds without resistance, and the acid sea's calming feels coincidental rather than earned by her agency. The piece declares escalation ("each tick a reminder that time itself was a fragile alloy") but never dramatizes a moment where her choice forecloses a path or imposes a trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the ending should reweight cost; instead it delivers satisfaction without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring a secret promise to capture "temporary eternity"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The cave journey unfolds as exploration without obstacle; finding the key and chest is a gift, not a reversal earned by the painter's agency. No meaningful tightening or trade-off narrows options. The final act (painting the new canvas) recapitulates the opening routine with glowing shells added, but no visible price is paid and no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Mara's options; she executes her plan unopposed, and the fisherman's arrival serves as external confirmation rather than a consequence of her risk. The piece declares escalation ("vibrations rose," "resonant sigh," "invisible bridge") without dramatizing a moment where Mara must trade one good for another or foreclose a path. Cost is told ("devotion," "gratitude") but never shown as a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping the geography of loss to enable reverse migration—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should come from density increase or pattern break; here the engine-building and nightly calls deepen the ritual but do not narrow options or force a trade-off. The ships' arrival is coincidental (they appear when the signal steadies) rather than driven by a navigator decision that forecloses a path. No visible cost: the navigator feels weight and warmth but does not lose, renounce, or endure anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—turning the eye into a communal truth-mirror—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. Mara's plan faces no genuine opposition: the smugglers' reversal ("fell silent, their greed eclipsed") is instant and unmotivated, erasing friction rather than deepening it. One tightening occurs (placing the eye, storm testing the seal), but the cost of Mara's involuntary truth-burst is abstract, and no live option is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break with cost. Marlowe's observation of tide-gaps and whisper to the wind proceed without visible friction, competing options, or tactical trade-offs. The final alignment of the flower is a symbolic gesture, not a tightening that forecloses a path or forces a choice with felt consequence. The "softly persistent" attribute recurs but does not visibly narrow options or impose cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the doorway of decisions to fulfill the promise—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the matrix chip clicks into the pedestal and the doorway materializes. Yet the escalation lacks agency-driven cost: Elian places the chip, the door opens, he sees "endless horizons," and chooses to return without visible trade-off or forfeited path. The creek's rising tempo is mentioned but does not complicate or narrow options in the final beat, and no micro-choice forces a hierarchy of values with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"unravel the mystery of recurring dreams"—is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the queen climbs, finds a basin, and the orb reveals everything without resistance. Agency is absent: the orb "poured into her veins" passively, and the retinue obeys without friction. Coincidence resolves: the crystal basin conveniently holds the exact images needed, and the orb bursts on contact. No on-page cost alters later tactics; the final vow ("watch over the ridge") is asserted, not earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to capture the density of presence"—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the experiment proceeds smoothly from setup to success. Coincidence does not complicate; luck does not solve—because nothing opposes. The friends "agreed to protect the glow" without dramatized friction or trade-off. No visible price is paid; the final image asserts uplift ("carry the glow within them") but forecloses no prior option.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to distill chaos into narrative"—is declared but never tested by an external obstacle or forced trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the narrator reflects, dreams, writes, and steps outside in a sequence that accumulates mood but does not escalate pressure. The final resolve to "begin to soar again" lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed. Coincidence does not intrude, but agency remains contemplative rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—unveiling ordinary miracles—is stated early but never tested by an external obstacle or internal doubt that forces a trade-off. The repair proceeds smoothly: Lena aligns the screw, the pendulum swings, the fog lifts, and she feels renewed. No reversal, tightening, or escalation occurs; the water level rises "gently" without complication. The protagonist's agency is limited to observation and ritual gestures (whispering, tracing threads) that do not foreclose a path or risk failure. The ending offers no visible cost—Lena steps back "feeling the world breathe anew" with no sacrifice or consequence that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake ("transform scars into stories") is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or foreclosed option appears—Lira performs a ritual without complication, and the scars simply lift. The piece offers atmosphere but no escalation under the Accumulative lens: density does not increase, no pattern breaks, no cadence shift reweights cost. Agency is absent; the transformation occurs to her rather than through a decision with visible price. No on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—deliver an overdue apology to Mara—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates texturally (perfume → piano vibrations → sheet descent → wind-carried words) but no reversal or tactical cost narrows options; the exorcist's actions proceed unopposed. The apology's text materializes without friction, and Mara's response remains off-page. One tightening occurs when the orchard's final tree falls and "the echo of her apology lingered," but this reads as atmospheric confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake ("unravel cosmic illusions") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the protagonist encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and faces no narrowing of options. The ritual unfolds as spectacle without agency—luck or the universe's compliance resolves everything off-stage. The final "aching peace" is declared without visible price, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"understand what clocks really measure"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete trade-off or reversal. The counting ritual and hydraulic release occur without opposition, cost, or tightening of options. No visible price is paid; the shepherd simply concludes his inquiry and walks away. The piece describes atmospheric procedure but generates no escalation or agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake is "to widen perspectives responsibly" and prove that probability can embrace chance, but this remains abstract and never tested on the page. Each beat—coin placement, lantern lift, tunnel traversal—succeeds without complication or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the path clears automatically when Mara performs the correct symbolic gesture. The final theorem is asserted without showing what Mara sacrificed, risked, or lost to achieve it, so escalation and cost are absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming endings into beginnings through collected voices—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces on-page testing or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows Mara's options: each call simply adds another layer to the disc without complication, refusal, or trade-off. The "Thank you" voice serves as external confirmation rather than a choice Mara must make under pressure. Escalation is conceptual (more voices accumulate) but does not deepen or constrain her agency, and the final step out carries no visible price—what does she forfeit by leaving, and why now?

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("preserve small moments," "renew the covenant") but never tested on the page; no opposition, resource limit, or ticking consequence forces a choice. The archivist encounters no reversal, complication, or cost—he arrives, writes, and departs in a frictionless arc. Pressure does not escalate under any lens; the final beat mirrors the opening without tightening or reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("find the cure for loneliness") is signaled early. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs: the caretaker's puzzle is mentioned, then solved; the fragment is lifted without complication. Agency is execution of a plan with no visible trade-off, mistake, or forfeiture. The chime spreads outward and "each listener felt a fleeting lift," but this is summary-told, not dramatized through a character resisting, choosing, or paying a price. Cost is conceptual (cure = act of catalyzing) but not legible as a before/after change in options or stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"navigate uncharted emotional depths"—is declared early but never tested on the page. Lira encounters no reversal, no competing pull, no cost that narrows options; the forest "responded with a trail of musical notes" and she follows without error or sacrifice. The stillpoint arrival feels granted rather than earned, and the ending announces convergence ("all absorbed languages converged into one harmonious chord") without showing a price paid or path foreclosed. Agency is absent; coincidence (the melody, the ring's glow) delivers resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("edit history … to reverse the seed planting error") is signaled early but never tested by a live constraint or competing cost. The single reversal—hologram buds glowing with corrected data—arrives via narrated magic ("I whispered to the pen") rather than protagonist choice under pressure. Escalation is asserted through intensifiers ("strange comfort," "profound," "redemption") without an on-page turn that narrows options. No visible price is paid; the anomaly "settled" conveniently, and the narrator ends empowered without forfeiting a path.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("translate silence into music that could soothe souls") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or resource scarcity. Arlen's gesture-performance succeeds without friction; no reversal or tightening narrows his options. Lira's arrival promises escalation but instead offers a redundant echo: she mimics the same gestures and feels the same harbor response with no dramatized cost or trade-off. The "joyful sorrow" label in Arlen's chest is asserted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path. No visible price paid on the page alters later tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. The vandalized self-portrait is framed as a clue but its discovery requires no decision and the "trail of artistic creations" unfolds as a scavenger hunt without escalation. The tapestry fitting "perfectly" onto the stone eliminates friction rather than forcing a choice. Agency is absent: coincidence (the perfect fit, the sliding stone) resolves the quest, and the final mural-painting is recounted in summary without cost or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to breathe life into a shared dream"—is declared but never tested by competing costs or narrowed options. Lira begins drumming and the garden responds beneficently; no reversal, complication, or trade-off emerges. The staff's protocol shift happens off-page in their dreams, bypassing agency and on-page escalation. The piece offers metaphysical transformation without friction: drumming simply works, the universe inhales cooperatively, and sorrow softens into hope without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is declared but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Milo's ritual (coin, map, key) proceeds without reversal, resistance, or cost. The radio crackles his phrase back, confirming the legend without agency or price. No meaningful tightening or deepening under any lens; the ending restates the premise rather than narrowing options or forcing sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake ("teach darkness the value of stars") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the guardian begins weaving and succeeds without opposition, complication, or visible cost. Coincidence does not intrude, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation—the darkness "seemed to pause" and "sensed the weight of stars" without dramatized resistance or friction. The fisherman's gratitude and the night's "quiet triumph" are asserted outcomes, not earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—spreading "second thoughts" via chess—is declared but never tested by resistance, cost, or a competing want. No on-page reversal or tightening choice appears; the windows succeed without friction, and the mayor's reversal is summarized. Coincidence (neighbors "drawn," citizens "aware") drives all turns. The ending claims irreversibility but shows no price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara's hunger to break free—is signaled but never tested by a meaningful reversal or competing cost. The whale's call and the scrimshaw's unlocking proceed without friction; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. "After violence became impossible" is a striking premise but remains abstract; it never shapes a present choice or tactic. The ending asserts transformation ("defend the fragile peace") without showing what Mara relinquished or risked to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"cultivating lightness in grief"—is declared but never dramatized as a choice under pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara begins whittling and finishes without obstacle or cost. The "happiness mandate" should impose external pressure, but its enforcement is absent from the scene. Agency is missing: Mara performs a pre-decided action without friction, renunciation, or visible price. The resolution is asserted ("a new hush had been remade") rather than earned through protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the poet recites, pauses, walks, and crosses without encountering resistance or trade-off. The "tremor of certainty" is asserted to settle into rhythm, but this is told escalation without causal trigger. No visible price paid; coincidence (the lake glowing amber, the ban lifting) replaces protagonist agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—Selene's quest to perceive beauty in imperfection—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening. Each "bartered awakening" is performed identically (arrange plants → reed sings → new hue perceived) with no escalation, resistance, or cost. The glassblower's arrival and the final glass-flower garden are additions, not consequences of prior pressure. No visible price alters later tactics; Selene's plan succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—awakening connection in the artificial mind—is signaled early but never tested. The sequence proceeds demonstration → success without complication, agency choice, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the bell ringer's actions produce intended effects without cost or resistance. The final act ("set the next sequence") resets to repetition rather than escalating or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching withering to bloom—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Each step (find stencil, trace coordinates, revive rose, scatter cranes) succeeds without reversal or meaningful tightening. The rose's revival and the visitors' arrival are granted rather than earned through agency or sacrifice. No live trade-off or foreclosed option appears; the narrative accumulates images of renewal without escalation or a choice that narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to guide post-crash rebuilding—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication appears; the cartomancer proceeds from first measurement to final smile without obstacle or cost. The "snapped gently at a critical juncture" could be a turn, but the text immediately declares success ("where hope could be re‑stitched") rather than forcing a trade-off. Agency is observational, not decisional, and no price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but never tested by a tightening choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The historian approaches, steps irregularly, and succeeds without visible price; no reversal, no failed attempt, no on-page cost that alters later tactics. Coincidence (the pagoda responds to his steps) resolves the conflict. Under any lens, escalation is absent; the story moves from desire to fulfillment in a straight line with no meaningful pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.5)
    A dominant stake—preserving hope for future wanderers—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The protagonist encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and pays no visible price; the stone warms obligingly, the footage brightens, and his "mission" concludes without escalation. The "shadow unbound" remains abstract, never narrowing options or forcing a tactical shift under the Accumulative lens. Agency is absent: the universe places fragments "with gentle intention," and the protagonist's only act is passive observation followed by convenient validation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing trust—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Mara's options; she gathers objects, arranges them, and the chameleon's colors merge without resistance or cost. The con's "aftershocks of betrayal" are told in the opening but never dramatize a complication or force a trade-off. Agency is present as decision to heal, but the lack of opposition or visible price keeps pressure flat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (learning to read scar stories) is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off—the moss cooperates, the ritual succeeds, and closure arrives without a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the sequence is additive (descend, listen, align, succeed) rather than escalating. The "displaced miracle" revelation and hourglass clearing feel convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. Under any lens, pressure remains static and the resolution lacks the felt or conceptual cost required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by opposition or meaningful tightening. No reversal occurs: the gazer searches, hums, finds the box, reads letters, and the process unfolds as smooth revelation without cost or trade-off. Agency is absent; the protagonist receives rather than decides. The "final goodbye" whispered to empty seats carries no felt price or foreclosed option. Coincidence (hidden compartment revealed by humming) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—"to free trapped creativity"—is declared but never tested on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The dreamer's actions (rest, trace, lift instrument) do not escalate pressure or narrow choices. The "final crescendo" and "freedom" are asserted without reversal or cost. Coincidence (stars fall conveniently) enables resolution rather than protagonist agency, violating the lens requirement that coincidence may complicate but not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reignite the world's corners—is signaled early and coheres through the guard's use of the charm and archive. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clock ticks in reverse, releasing waves of potential, but this moment lacks a trade-off or visible cost. The guard's agency is present (he whispers charms, reaches into the archive, spreads sparks) but no live option is foreclosed on the page. The resolution (light-trees rising) feels granted rather than earned through a choice under pressure. Escalation is more textural (color shifts, hum rising) than causal, consistent with an accumulative lens but not charged with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled ("rediscover the wild frontier of his mind"), but it never tightens or deepens on the page. No reversal occurs; the philosopher encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and experiences no escalation—he simply "traces the pattern," places the gear, and the engine awakens without cost. The ending offers no on-page consequence or foreclosed path; he walks "onward" with "probable miracles humming," a declaration rather than a dramatized price. Agency is absent: the protagonist observes and receives rather than decides under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is declared but never tested by a live dilemma or visible trade-off. The ferry arrives, the cave opens, the chest reveals a map; each step proceeds via world mechanics rather than Mira's agency under pressure. No reversal narrows options, and the final "reclaimed courage" carries no on-page cost—no visible price paid, no path foreclosed. Coincidence (the ticket fits the clasp) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—"to understand the cost of safety"—is signaled early and deepened when the bolt's placement shifts the discoloration and the guests' rhythms align, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet escalation is illustrative: the bellhop's choice to place the bolt and the guests' subsequent acceptance occur without friction, competing wants, or visible loss of another option. No guest voices doubt about lingering, no one attempts departure, no stamina or warmth is spent. The story delivers one pressure point (bolt → hue shift → alignment) but the protagonist agency is passive observation, and the cost—bearing silence—is understood rather than paid in a scene beat that forecloses warmth or speech.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is signaled early, but escalation occurs through discovery rather than protagonist agency—the ink guides, the rune flares, the temple collapses, all independent of the titan's decisions. Touching the crown triggers the climax, but the action feels coincidental rather than a weighed choice with alternatives. The resolution (pretender fades, throne restored) lacks visible cost to the titan; he tucks the crown away and walks off into twilight with "quiet pride" rather than forfeiting something on the page. One tightening (finding the pellet, following the map) narrows options, meeting minimum escalation for this length, but agency remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stated motivation—"to discover why some paths disappear"—drives curiosity but never faces a meaningful trade-off or complication. The tapping practice and data assembly proceed without resistance; the watermark discovery solves the mystery without protagonist struggle or cost. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the ending declares success rather than testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. The engines restart through the stone's agency, not the protagonist's choice; she listens and whispers but faces no trade-off or renunciation. "Awkward confidence" is declared to bloom without visible hesitation or cost. The "lull in rebellion" setup promises tension but delivers only a mechanical reactivation loop; no reversal or deepening narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unsealing the embryo to reshape tradition—is signaled early. Escalation is minimal: each action (find kite, decode script, perform ritual) succeeds without meaningful opposition or cost. The "sacrifice of memory" is the only claimed price, but it's told rather than shown; we never see Anara hesitate, weigh alternatives, or feel the loss. No reversal narrows options; the plants cooperate, the community gathers, and the future is affirmed without friction. The piece defaults toward situational pressure (ritual as stance crystallization) but the ritual itself is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph handling and the sapling encounter. The piece deepens rather than reverses: she moves from passive observation to active vow. However, the vow itself ("I will remember... I will honor...") does not narrow options or impose visible trade-off; the sapling is already scarred, and her promise to it incurs no on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, the tightening is modest and the cost implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is Elian's artistic renewal after years of feeling his portraits are broken. Pressure accumulates through card arrangement, spiral-making, and descent rather than external opposition. The one on-page tightening—entering the chamber, door slamming—narrows options physically but the stakes remain internal and atmospheric. Agency at closure is acceptance ("why not let the flame consume the old self?") without visible forfeit; what live option was foreclosed is unstated. Cost is felt as "luminescent ache" but remains metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("why time slows in crisis") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—Kael releases ink, watches patterns, "senses" a collective pause, then declares understanding without friction, loss, or trade-off. The ink's revelation is delivered via summary interiority ("He realized…," "Kael understood…") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; the final image (walking toward the horizon with the drone circling) asserts purpose without demonstrating cost or agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—provoking dissent versus preserving fragile peace—is signaled early. One tightening: inserting the letter → networks ripple → council convenes. Yet Maren's agency ends after the insertion; the story narrates consequences rather than forcing her into new trade-offs. No reversals or deepening choices follow; the escalation is told ("scandal would echo," "archivists awakened") without on-page resistance or a second decision under greater pressure. The cost (her own "frozen preservation") is mentioned but never materializes as a felt price; she smiles at the end without visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake (restore hope/continuity) is signaled early, but no tightening or reversal tests Lira's commitment. She encounters a boy with a broken compass but the moment resolves immediately without cost or complication. No on-page obstacle forces a trade-off or forecloses an option; the resolution distributes rose petals in a gathering that mirrors the opening without escalation or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The fisher follows garden cues in a passive sequence without reversals or tightening choices. The spike's use and the final casting are described as smooth successes with no friction, failed attempt, or visible price. Agency is absent; coincidence (garden responding, spike humming) drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled (expose the ledger/scandal), but escalation is absent: Mira encounters no reversal, trade-off, or tightening choice. The console solves the problem for her; the siren announces success without cost. The journalist's arrival completes the handoff but adds no pressure. Agency is passive observation plus a single insertion action; coincidence (the console recognizing the nib's "lineage") resolves the conflict. No on-page price forecloses a path. Closure form is judged in Q2; here the escalation and cost are missing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing guilt via the amber device—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or visible cost. Lyra encounters no resistance: the haunted firmware "responded" and "untangl[ed]" without failure or setback. The final act of writing a letter and slipping it under the desk is ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. No reversal, escalation, or price paid narrows her path; the resolution unfolds as a sequence of successful steps without agency-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. Liora's actions (tracing spirals, whispering to the tile) encounter no resistance, reversal, or cost. The violinist's arrival adds a parallel gesture but no escalation or choice under pressure. No live option is foreclosed, and the "emergent hush" merely accumulates descriptive mentions without narrowing tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to cradle empathy in arms of steel"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; the protagonist kneels, forms a word, whispers it, and light cascades without resistance or visible price. The story summarizes transformation ("the city learned to cradle empathy") rather than dramatizing a single choice that forecloses a live option. Coincidence resolves: the tessera pulses on cue, survivors gather, children play—none shaped by protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the fractured timeline to deliver an encore—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. The ghost's singing generates echoes without friction or cost; the orchard amplifies passively, and the shopkeeper's arrival resolves the conflict through coincidence rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful deepening or escalation occurs; the ghost simply performs and the universe complies. The absence of visible price or tactical constraint under the Accumulative lens leaves pressure abstract and momentum flat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—achieving neural resonance without a drug—is signaled, but no meaningful escalation occurs under any lens. Mara encounters no obstacles, failures, or costs; each step (calibrating brushes, tracing fractures, programming LEDs, recording data) succeeds linearly. The "true test" is mentioned but not dramatized on the page, and the final "whisper of another mind" arrives without visible price or foreclosed option. Pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.4)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (completing the sensory map), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under pressure. The map maker's actions proceed without reversal, resistance, or live trade-off; the leaf glows, droplets float, the map completes. Coincidence (the human's emergence, the calmer water) decorates the ending rather than testing protagonist agency. No visible price is paid that narrows later options.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy—is declared early but never tested by a reversal or competing pressure. Each step (cataloging buttons, listening to the echo, arranging buttons, turning the hourglass) succeeds without friction, narrowed options, or visible trade-off. The final act—stepping onto the sand bridge—feels triumphant rather than costly; no live option is foreclosed, and the resolution grants possibility without sacrifice. Coincidence (the echo "recognizing" buttons, sand forming a bridge exactly when needed) drives closure rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—fixing broken trust through redemption—is signaled early but never narrows options through protagonist agency. The spy follows a preset ritual (trace codes, align pillbox, drink vial, follow melt, place pillbox) without meaningful resistance or trade-offs. The valley and spring appear to solve the internal conflict through external magic rather than forced choice. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the "unused courage" is claimed by stepping into a pass that offers no visible obstacle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stated stake—"to distill the complexity of the river's memory"—remains abstract and untested. No opposition, reversal, or tightening appears; Arlen performs a metaphorical ritual (invisible stitching, listening) and the world complies without friction. The rain gutters stop, fog lifts, and resolution arrives by atmospheric coincidence rather than protagonist agency. No visible cost forecloses a path or alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the oasis resists change—is signaled early and pursued through perception (tracing vibrations, following sun patterns, whispering to the lantern). Yet pressure never tightens into a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The lantern brightens, the hive awakens, and the oasis breathes without Mara sacrificing, risking, or forfeiting anything. The accumulative design does not excuse the absence of a legible price at closure; the final image offers transformation but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara wants to "instill a gentle light into the harbor's darkest corners" to keep "night's secrets from turning to dread." The vines unfurl and spread light, darkness recoils—one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no reversal or live cost appears: planting proceeds without obstacle, the harbor "accepts" without resistance, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. No visible price (stamina drain, social exposure, tool failure) alters tactics or forecloses an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake ("translate isolation into independence") is declared but never tested by a reversal, trade-off, or tightening that narrows options. No credible obstacle appears: Mira performs a ritual (placing the sundial), the library "sings," and the goal is announced as achieved without visible cost or foreclosed path. The sky-whale's "coexistence" is atmospheric rather than a source of friction. Escalation is absent; the piece moves through a sequence of images without pressure rising or a decision altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("find the thread that connects all things") is told in exposition but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Mira's approach to the spiral, whisper, step, and realization unfold without complication, refusal, or visible cost. The "rejoin" is declared complete without forfeiting a live option or altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—"outwit cosmic tricksters"—never materializes as on-page pressure with trade-offs; the subsonic method works frictionlessly, the false alarm is "diverted" off-page, and the community hums in unity without visible resistance or cost. No credible tightening or deepening occurs; instead the narrative expands laterally (dorm rooms, firehouse, valley) in summary. Agency is observation and setup rather than choice under duress, and coincidence (the dean's assembly, the crowd already humming) resolves tension that was never dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake ("uncover a vital key") is signaled but never tested by a live cost—no fork where retrieval demands sacrifice. The "spatial mutiny" reads as effect rather than escalating pressure; the passage opens on cue without forcing a trade-off. Claustrophobia is told ("whispering that the tunnel would crush him") but does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page. Band guardrail: the tightening does not foreclose a live option or force visible price, keeping score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—resolving cold cases via portraiture—is declared but never tested. No on-page escalation occurs: Mara paints, the quarry "responds" passively, and success is asserted without reversal or cost. Agency is absent; coincidence (the fissure's crack, names appearing) delivers resolution. The child's name "etched into the ragged edge" is a late plant, not a clue Mara pursues. No tightening or deepening forecloses a path; the ending grants satisfaction without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the ancestor by retrieving the nail—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. Mara descends, finds the nail, rallies the crew, and embeds it; each step unfolds without friction or a narrowing of options. The incoming vortex is announced but does not force a trade-off or alter tactics; it simply passes. No on-page reversal or tightening exists, and the resolution is delivered by convenience (the crew cooperates immediately, the storm leaves the nail "immobile") rather than protagonist agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (activate pixelated amnesty to restore the hitchhiker) is signaled early and remains coherent, but escalation is absent: the fiddler faces no meaningful obstacle, counter-pressure, or tightening choice during the trek or ritual. The sequence unfolds as ordained steps (trek, play, expose) without a turn that narrows options or raises cost. The ending grants the fiddler success without visible price—his "heart hammered with luminous disbelief" but no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece needed a pattern break or cadence shift that reweighted the stake; instead it delivers smooth fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—why paths circle back—is named explicitly, but no on-page tightening forces Arlen to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. Maya's objection to the markers is "gently dissuaded" without friction or consequence, and the startup crash arrives as summarized backstory ("clients withdrew, servers stalled, and investors fled") rather than dramatized reversal. The final realization that "circles are not failures but the universe's method of testing whether travelers remember the roads they once left" is told, not enacted; no decision narrows options or raises cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Each step (journal review, telescope alignment, glyph decoding) resolves smoothly without reversals or tightening that narrows options. The "shared burden" concept operates as theme rather than a constraint that forces sacrifice. No on-page price is paid; the temple door simply opens and the crystal confirms success, undercutting any sense of escalation or agency-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (to "unbend a frozen confession") is declared but never tested: the druid encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and the confession's release carries no visible price. Escalation is absent—she steps in, chants, the ice shatters, she gathers shards, the lake clears. Coincidence does not complicate; it simply delivers. The "warlike serenity" tone implies internal tension, but no on-page beat shows her balancing competing pressures or narrowing options. The final image (lake sighs, orchard bows) is a soft resolution that resets rather than reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled ("to find the intersection of dreams"), but no tightening or trade-off occurs. The maze parts, the clipping is grasped, the portal opens, and the beacon ignites in smooth sequence with no resistance, failure, or price. The protagonist's agency is passive reception: the world responds to her touch and whisper without her forfeiting time, safety, or relationship. Coincidence resolves every step—no decision narrows her options or costs her a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—patching holes in Maelia's soul—is signaled early and remains consistent, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is shallow: each sigil and soot-press iteration adds texture without narrowing options or raising cost. The root shivering and amber spreading offer a single tightening moment, yet the story lacks a reversal or trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. Agency is present but diffuse; Maelia's actions feel exploratory rather than decision-driven under mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose after public failure—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. No antagonist, obstacle, or ticking resource forces a trade-off; the protagonist passively catalogs relics and whispers resolutions. The tarnished compass and record player are backdrop props, not pressure points. The final "calm resolve" is asserted without visible cost or a decision that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding transition physics—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. The seed's successful germination and the arbor's cooperative response offer no reversal or complication; each step adds success without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. Lira's final decision to journey to the valleys introduces a new test rather than resolving pressure built on the page. No visible price is paid; the "haunted" ambitions depart conveniently off-stage before the story begins, removing internal conflict from the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine after tomorrow's disappearance—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The librarian decides to smelt a key, and the action succeeds without complication; no reversal or tightening choice narrows his options. The key's emergence, the creel's song, and the visitors' subsequent shifts are presented as inevitable outcomes rather than hard-won victories. Coincidence (the key melts into bamboo, the creel glows) resolves the problem without protagonist struggle. One deepening occurs when the librarian realizes his own identity must migrate, yet this insight costs nothing visible on the page and alters no tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"dissolve the walls between hearts"—remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Mara encounters no resistance, makes no trade-off, and the ritual succeeds without friction. The confessions dissolve "into the water" automatically; the pearl "began to pulse" on its own. Agency is absent, and the resolution (pearl placed, halo cast, walls melted) arrives by decree rather than earned escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: finding self-forgiveness via river-chronicling. Pressure accumulates through the descent into the tunnel and accordion-playing by the river, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The protagonist faces no tangible obstacle or competing desire; the journey is methodical exploration rather than escalation under resistance. The graffiti's wisdom ("Forgiveness is not a destination but a river you learn to cross") functions as thematic reassurance rather than a complication that raises cost. The final resolve to return ("I will walk this path again") reiterates intent without demonstrating a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed by a reversal. The watch's "unfolding cipher" and "cyclically reversed" gears are named at every turn but never create a tactical problem or force a trade-off. The "propagation delays" allow the pair to "anticipate the next reversal," erasing rather than raising pressure. Coincidence governs progression: alcoves open, glyphs rearrange, the crystal "resonates" and "projected a map" without protagonist agency or visible price. No foreclosed path, no escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("weigh a dream against an empire") is declared early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Elara discovers telepathy with vines, reads coffee stains, aligns the violin, and the problem resolves without visible cost or narrow options. The envoy's sword-lowering is not driven by protagonist agency but by transferred emotion. No on-page reversal or deepening that forecloses a path; the floating city rises, the empire agrees, and the promise's glow returns brighter—symmetric satisfaction without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (capture the aurora's last spark before oblivion) is signaled early but never genuinely tested. No on-page obstacle complicates her task—she listens, traces patterns, completes the infusion without error or cost. The emerald's flare and the aurora's acknowledgment are outcomes, not reversals. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the ritual proceeds smoothly from setup to completion without a moment that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Agency exists in her micro-actions, but pressure remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiveness—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The sunrise alignment is a ritual completion, not a choice with competing goods. No live alternative is foreclosed; Mara's care continues unchanged, rendering the "cycle turned" declaration cost-free. The storm sequence offers a potential complication (using the hairpin as compass) but resolves immediately without altering tactics or stakes. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight the stake; here it remains static across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—welcoming nuance into the magistrate's certainty—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Mara performs her ritual (chime reading, shard placement, knot unhooking) without obstacle, and the magistrate's transformation is asserted in metaphor rather than shown through a choice that forecloses an option. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the piece accumulates symbols but pressure remains static. The "cloak of doubt" settles as a conceptual shift, not a decision with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to teach vanishing—is signaled early but never tightens into a live dilemma with visible cost. The descent into the grotto proceeds without reversal or obstacle; Mira's realization arrives as revelation rather than hard-won choice. No on-page moment where she must choose between competing goods or forfeit a credible option. The text declares that she had been "withholding all along," but this self-diagnosis does not translate into a beat where withholding costs her something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by a tightening choice. The protagonist waits, watches birds, and then summarizes success without on-page struggle, reversal, or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the resolution is asserted rather than earned through agency under pressure. The escalation required under Accumulative lens (density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost) is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Selric's quest to validate his quiet magic—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: the spire, mist-walk, and keystone touch do not meaningfully tighten options or force trade-offs; each step succeeds without friction. No reversal or complication narrows his path; the "unstrapping" and "stepping onto the ledge" are symbolic gestures without dramatized cost. The resolution is delivered by the keystone's pulse, not Selric's agency under pressure. One beat (reaching the keystone) shifts the emotional register, but the cost remains abstract ("doubts dissolved") rather than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early but never tested or deepened by opposition. Eli's journey is frictionless: the key works, the door opens, the library appears, the revelation arrives. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful choice narrows options or forces a trade-off; the protagonist's agency is limited to observation and reception. The resolution is handed to Eli rather than earned through his alteration or renunciation, and no visible price is paid on the page. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake ("wavelength align with purpose") is signaled early but remains abstract and never narrows options or forces a trade-off. The story recounts a sequence (coins decoded → prophecy unwound → alignment achieved) without on-page reversal, escalation, or visible cost that would test Silas's commitment. Coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's agency is passive: he follows instructions ("Turn the last coin face‑up") rather than making a decision that forecloses a path. No tactical shift or price is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—naming nameless fears—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Each crystal yields its name without resistance; no reversal narrows options. The sequence is additive (more names) rather than escalating. The sailor's name arriving as memory rather than hard-won discovery undercuts agency. No visible price alters tactics; the transformation from grief to gratitude is declared, not earned through foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (restore cosmic balance) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The mage's lukewarm magic and earnest naivety are declared constraints, yet they do not cause failure, force adaptation, or require sacrifice. The dripping-rate method succeeds on the first sustained attempt; no reversal narrows options. The ending grants every goal without visible price: bell whole, fish return, stars realign, devotion validated—no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (expunge the myth) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or cost. Caitlyn follows photographs in a linear walk without reversal, tightening, or a choice that forecloses an option. Coincidence supplies all three photos conveniently; her agency is observation, not decision under pressure. No meaningful escalation under any lens—photos arrive, she interprets, townspeople gather, myth dissolves without visible cost. Band guardrails: entering 8.0+ requires a tightening that forecloses a live option; this piece offers none. Apply Non-closure Accumulation Cap −0.8 for static conflict across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is declared but never tested by a tightening that narrows options or forces trade-off. Each step (crystal placement, flame ignition, starling observation, explosion, spiral arrangement) proceeds without reversal or visible price. The ritual's success is assured from the outset; no competing desire, resource limit, or mistake generates pressure. Agency is procedural execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled early via the radio crackle and the fallen skyfarer's broken promise. The seeker's revision of the harness provides one meaningful action, and the crew's relief at the end gestures toward fulfillment. Yet the revision itself unfolds without friction: "His hands moved without thought," the knot is recalled through muscle memory, and the final loop tightens smoothly. No live complication forces a trade-off or narrows options; the radio's return ("Hold fast") arrives as affirmation rather than test. The piece delivers one coherent pressure arc under the Accumulative lens, but escalation remains implicit rather than dramatized through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—vivifying the Duplicate to restore feeling—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or reversal. The Guardians and Syndicate declare opposition but collapse without forcing Kael to sacrifice anything; his "silence" and blade swing face no cost or complication. The piece attempts a tightening (slice the jar) but it reads as convenient solution rather than earned escalation. No persistent constraint (time, resource, moral calculus) alters tactics, and coincidence (the factions simply "lower their weapons") resolves the custody battle off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early but never tested. The conductor performs without opposition, cost, or doubt; each action succeeds as declared. No on-page reversal narrows options or deepens pressure. The resolution is delivered by the protagonist's ritual, but no visible price is paid and no path is foreclosed. Escalation is replaced by decorative accumulation of metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to engage with uncertainty via the pendant—is signaled but never tested with a visible trade-off. The guardian "chose to wait" midway, then immediately reverses to open the wing without dramatized cost or escalation. No on-page tightening narrows options; the cult's warning that removal "could awaken that slumbering breach" is introduced and ignored without consequence. Agency reads as passive observation dressed in elevated diction rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—vivifying the crozier to interrupt destiny—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: each tincture application advances smoothly without reversal, complication, or trade-off. The protagonist's agency never forecloses a path or pays a price; no failed attempt, no resource scarcity, no moral friction. The "penny drops" marker recurs but triggers no tightening—it times actions without consequence. Closure asserts transformation ("destiny no longer predetermined") without dramatizing the cost that makes the shift legible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—tuning the city's transmitter to decode the shard's signal—is signaled early but unfolds without meaningful opposition or tightening. Selin's whispered intention and calibration succeed on first attempt with no failed tactics, resource loss, or conflicting goods. The villagers' gratitude arrives as external validation rather than a pressure point Selin navigated; their sudden appearance feels coincidental rather than earned through her prior agency. The piece lacks a reversal or deepening that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (merging timelines to stop the ferry's disappearance) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Lio turns on the radio, and reality complies without resistance or cost. Coincidence resolves the problem (the radio's "intention" alone does the work), and no agency—decision, renunciation, endurance—forecloses a live path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=2.9)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The protagonist faces no opposition, makes no choice with cost, and encounters no reversal—actions succeed without friction. "Erupt" recurs as visual effect but never escalates pressure or forecloses an option. The piece offers a series of tableau descriptions rather than a conflict arc: he weaves, colors burst, walls dissolve, rain falls, he walks, he leaves. No agency, no tightening, no price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight—is declared but never tested through on-page opposition or reversal. The test vessel "slipped silently" to success without complication, cost, or agency from Mira; she records data after the fact. No pressure escalates, no choice narrows options, and no meaningful trade-off appears. The entire arc is summarized as a smooth trajectory from problem to solution, with Mira as passive observer rather than active decider.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to protect vulnerable voices"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the protagonist follows a signal, finds a photograph, hears a voice, locates an alcove, raises the hearing aid, and the problem resolves itself with cascading light. Agency is absent: the hearing aid "grew steadier," the voice "rose," the light "spilled," and the statues "bowed"—all passive receipt rather than decision or renunciation. Escalation is cosmetic repetition (pulse, whisper, hymn, chord) without a moment where the protagonist faces competing goods or unavoidable harms. No visible price is paid; the final "promise to guard" costs nothing and changes nothing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (track invisible things via the codex), and the tidal clock implies urgency. The phase-field shimmer provides one moment of escalation, but protagonist agency is minimal: Mara performs scripted steps (align, whisper sequence, activate protocol) without on-page friction or a decision that narrows options. The "misstep could strand her" threat is declared but never tested. Closure involves burying the codex, but the text does not show what she sacrifices or refuses to secure that outcome, leaving cost asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—correcting the death-certificate error and defragmenting the ghost—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or live cost. The ink ritual unfolds as description; no reversal narrows options or forces Mara to forfeit anything on the page. The ghost's "confession" and the shard absorbing corrupted data read as convenient resolution rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Agency is observational; the final pulse alignment is declared, not earned through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stated stake—preserving a dying language—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that narrows options. The storyteller performs his ritual step by step (whispers, traces, records) without encountering resistance, reversal, or a moment where success costs him something tangible. The birds and diamond cooperate; the canyon "listens" and complies. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the escalation is purely descriptive accumulation. No felt cost is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"locating the echoing beast that fed on forgotten myths"—is declared but never tested; the creature manifests as a disembodied phone voice offering metamorphosis, and the protagonist's only action is placing the arrowhead down and listening. The mission "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" arrives as an order rather than a want in conflict with a need, and no on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The arrowhead shattering and the moss responding occur as automatic effects, not choices that trade one path for another. Escalation is absent; pressure remains static from the phone's first crackle to the garden's closure, and coincidence (the arrowhead's spontaneous burst) resolves the conflict without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is declared early but never tested by genuine opposition or reversal. The statues "demand" the music cease, yet immediately capitulate to a single note; no tightening of options or escalation of cost follows. The violinist's success is frictionless and his final vow is summary-only, lacking on-page agency or visible price. One micro-turn (statues lower arms) occurs, but it does not narrow options or raise cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—fostering peace between factions—is declared early but never tested by an on-page obstacle that Milo's choice narrows or trades off. The storm blinds the drone's sensors, forcing retreat, but this is the bottle's effect, not Milo's agency under pressure; he lifts and sets it without visible cost or a competing fear. The rival drone's arrival and nod read as coincidental validation rather than a reversal earned by Milo's risk. No price is paid: the bottle remains "a calm sky" in his coat, absences are "linked" by assertion, and the ending claims hope delivered without showing what Milo forfeited to cross the border or what tactic the storm's use foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.1)
    No dominant stake is signaled early; "interpret silence as possibility" is a thematic abstraction, not a goal with stakes. The carousel repairs itself in response to Mara's song without her agency driving a turn—magic resolves what magic created. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the text loops through escalating mystical phenomena (fog, hidden compartment, brass garden, cavern of mirrors) without a single moment where Mara's choice narrows options or incurs cost. Coincidence (halo fragment glows, train breathes) supplies all change.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening analog memories to guide seekers—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page obstacle or cost appears: the scarf's vibration, Mara's algorithm, and the star-chronicle projection occur without friction or trade-off. The patrons' awe and Mara's logging are outcomes, not earned through protagonist agency under pressure. One meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options is absent, and the "delicate balance" mentioned at the end is told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) is signaled early but remains abstract and unchanging. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara's sunrise ritual succeeds without obstacle, and Lio's net "filled with a shimmering filament" resolves the quest via coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The ending declares success ("the islands glowed with a soft, endless sunrise") without visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—"to free an idea trapped behind fear"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete counter-pressure or dilemma on the page. The locksmith encounters disorienting cobblestones but no opposition that forces a tradeoff; he whispers a question, the wind answers with a convenient groove, and he twists the ribbon free. No reversal, no escalation, no visible price paid. The piece recounts a smooth arc from intention to fulfillment without a moment where success becomes uncertain or where the protagonist must sacrifice a competing goal.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: the protagonist moves hull to hull in a smooth catalog without setback, adaptation, or cost. The sextant discovery and mushroom-rearrangement succeed on first attempt with no resistance. Water receding and saplings appearing read as automatic rewards rather than earned through agency or renunciation. One meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—ending the library's reversible exile—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: each annotation glows, each tea-leaf circle forms perfectly, each ancient mechanism responds on cue without friction or failure. The archivist's agency consists of performing a ritual (tip tea, read geometry, annotate, place shadow) that encounters zero resistance; coincidence (the sun striking "at the precise angle") resolves the problem the protagonist did not help create. The backwards-walking moment offers a micro-turn ("She steadied herself") but it deflates immediately with no tactical cost or foreclosed option. No tightening, no price, no deepening—only a sequence of decorative successes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. The storm scene offers a potential reversal ("threatened to drown"), yet the pruner sings and transmutes it into nourishment without cost; apparent complication becomes instant solution. The traveler's arrival might force a choice (give the sprig or withhold?), but the pruner "smiled" and offered it freely. No agency decision narrows options or deepens pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—grounding restless spirits—is clear and signaled early, but pressure never escalates or tightens. Each knot loosens without resistance; no spirit refuses to depart, no thread resists the needle, no memory demands more than Elara is willing to give. The lone "micro turn" is spirits rising and sinking back, which does not narrow options or alter her tactics. No on-page cost appears: her months-long restoration is told in summary, and the final act (placing the mask) requires no sacrifice or difficult choice. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required—this piece offers only linear repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reopening the chapel by interpreting its silence—is signaled early but never tested with a live obstacle or trade-off. The protagonist's actions are methodical yet frictionless: she sets up, pauses, traces, repositions, and succeeds without a reversal or narrowing of options. No visible cost or forfeited path accompanies the resolution; the chapel's reopening is granted by atmospheric consensus rather than earned through agency. One tightening or deepening is required at this length; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("note the last transmission") is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, no tightening: Mort retrieves, untangles, listens, records, departs without obstacle or trade-off. The "final strand snapped" is presented as a natural event, not a choice. Agency (renunciation, endurance, decision) is absent; Mort observes and floats. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift—neither appears.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—articulating the ghost's unspoken need—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through three lightning strikes and encoding cycles, and the ghost's algorithm shifts in response. However, the balladeer never faces a meaningful tradeoff or loss; each flower press succeeds without complication. The resolution (ghost satisfied, courtyard becomes archive) arrives through accumulation rather than a choice that narrows options. One tightening (ghost projecting the balladeer's name) registers, but cost remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—retrieving hidden joy—is signaled early but pressure never escalates. The servant encounters no obstacles: the goggles unlock the diary instantly, the stairs are simply descended, the chamber is entered, the jars lifted. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible price paid. The resolution feels granted rather than earned by agency under pressure. One meaningful tightening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—proving that empty spaces remember—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Aria begins in contemplation and ends in contemplation with no narrowed options. The method (categorizing clouds by emotion) proceeds without obstacle, cost, or resistance. Agency is observation and recording, not decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—complete the mural before demolition—is signaled early but never escalates. No reversal or meaningful tightening narrows options; Lira mixes pigments, presses the coin, finishes the final segment, and the building falls with the mural intact. The demolition crew's arrival does not force a trade-off or alter her process. No on-page cost is legible; she "smiled" and the piece ends in declarative triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—charting luminance to guide future voyages—is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Lira's phrasebook translation and chalk ritual succeed on first attempt without complication. The "stray halo intensified" and "wrapped around the copper" with no resistance, trade-off, or visible price. Pressure remains flat from setup to resolution, and the ending grants success without agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early but never faces escalation or cost. The locksmith encounters no reversal, no opposition, and no price; the prophecy guides him, the gears click into place, and the clock mends without friction. The resolution is gift-wrapped by prophecy rather than earned by protagonist agency, and no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake—ringing the bell to amplify hope—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or contradictory desire. The villagers gather water and approach; the bell rings on first contact with no reversal, tightening, or visible price. Escalation is absent: no live option is foreclosed, no tactic adjusted under resistance. The ending grants collective success without agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—pausing the doomsday clock through the lullaby—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara places the puppet head, turns the dial, whispers, and the world pauses without obstacle or price. The "hush" arrives passively ("materialized"), and the lullaby "seeped" without resistance. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; here, each beat restates the mission without escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—completing the ritual before frost to guide travelers—is signaled early and governs all moves. Pressure accumulates through the frost deadline and circling birds, and the nut placement delivers one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. However, protagonist agency is minimal: the caretaker executes a predetermined sequence without on-page reversals, trade-offs, or forced choices. The ritual succeeds without visible cost to the protagonist's options or tactics; travelers emerge, but no live alternative was foreclosed. Escalation reads as atmospheric buildup rather than decision-driven narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows Mara's options; the foam insight resolves her problem without friction or trade-off. The months-later summary of polymer curing fractures tells rather than dramatizes cost. Agency is passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (finding the place where stories begin) is signaled but never tested by resistance or cost. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows the vendor's options—he places the bottle, it glows, the library responds, and he smiles. The child's arrival adds no complication; together they pour moonlight in a frictionless gesture. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), escalation requires a meaningful pressure point or choice that forecloses a path; here none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—to "sandpaper rough memories" and dissolve collective remorse—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No live complication or reversal tests Lir's method; he proceeds through his ritual without resistance, miscalculation, or escalating cost. The coral cracking and sandstorm rising feel like atmospheric events rather than consequences of his agency, and the resolution lacks a visible tradeoff or price that would narrow later options or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—healing the city by linking silos—is declared but never tested. The librarian drops the weight, languages intersperse, workers appear, bridges are built, gratitude rises; no reversal, tightening, or trade-off occurs. Coincidence does not merely complicate; it resolves: the chime's effect is instantaneous and total. No agency narrows options, no price is paid, no want conflicts with fear. The resolution is delivered rather than earned, and the accumulative texture does not deepen or shift cadence to reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    One dominant stake is clear: modify the mirror to interface with the canyon's memory. Pressure accumulates through calibration, the canyon's responsive hum, and the projected tableau, but no tightening choice narrows Aria's options or forces a trade-off with legible cost. The tremor introduces a moment of risk ("the stone could fracture"), yet she steadies herself and presses on without visible consequence or tactical adjustment. The ending reconfigures the mirror from relic to compass, but coincidence (dawn arrives, the tableau fades) drives the resolution more than protagonist agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early but remains abstract and never visibly tested. No reversal or complication arises: Liora consults the doodle, enters during the scheduled hour, aligns symbols, and succeeds without friction. The hour of inverted gravity is a coincidental window rather than a pressure she creates or pays for. Agency is entirely passive; the glyph dissolves and seedlings sprout without her making a choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or escalation. Auris encounters no resistance, cost, or trade-off; he simply performs his craft and succeeds. The hedgehog, owls, and grove respond passively, and no reversal or deepening forces a choice that narrows options. The ending declares transformation without demonstrating a price paid or path foreclosed, leaving pressure coherent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the difficult" and repair the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page tightening or deepening narrows options: he arrives seeking, places imagined pieces without resistance, receives a sliver of light as confirmation, and departs with unchanged resolve. Agency is observational and declarative (whispers, lifts, speaks) rather than renunciative or enduring with visible cost. Coincidence (magnetic currents answering his phrase) resolves the pattern without protagonist struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"catalog the varieties of silence…the first step toward the path to empathy"—is abstract and never tested; the protagonist faces no opposition, failed attempt, or trade-off. The ritual with crystal plates succeeds immediately, the clasp opens without complication, and the whispered names cause ink to bloom on cue. No reversal or tightening occurs; the piece moves in a smooth escalation of success without price. The final vow and workshop invitation are declarative goals, not choices under pressure, and the crowds' gasping response is asserted rather than earned through on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("cultivate serenity") but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or visible cost appears; the seed grows without obstacle, the flower blooms, and the village affirms the outcome. Coincidence does not complicate, and protagonist agency does not alter tactics. The resolution is given rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early but never jeopardized on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows Mira's options; the probe touch immediately yields the arrow tip without complication. The discovery accelerates plant growth instantly (paragraph 13), but no visible cost or trade-off accompanies the choice to release the tip. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final dissolution reads as thematic promise rather than a pressure point with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—documenting wind patterns to release lingering storm energy—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through data collection and mapping, but the escalation is largely mechanical: each reading adds to the curve without raising personal cost or forcing a trade-off. The climax (whispering command) feels arbitrary rather than a choice that narrows options, and the vortex's response lacks visible friction or sacrifice that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The declared stake ("certify wonder as essential") is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No tightening, reversal, or deepening occurs; the bell ringer executes her ritual without friction, failure, or tradeoff. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates. No escalation under any lens; the final act is indistinguishable in pressure from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—bringing back insights from failure—is signaled early but never tests Mara with a live trade-off or reversal. The seam widens on cue; no on-page complication arises from the world beyond or her choice to enter. The ending promise ("listen to every failure") reweights her mission conceptually, but the escalation path lacks a meaningful tightening where Mara must forfeit one path to secure another.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping emotion into numerical patterns—is signaled early but never faces on-page pressure or a tightening that narrows options. No reversal occurs; the halo fragment simply "approves" and then cracks, releasing shards without agency from Mara. The final act (collecting shards, promising to press them tomorrow) lacks visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is asserted ("the room shivered," "the workshop seemed to breathe") rather than built through causal links that force a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—spreading wonder via the pendant—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. Each encounter (shepherd, girl) succeeds instantly with no tightening or trade-off; the courier's jitteriness never escalates into a choice that narrows options. The pendant's power is unlimited, no resource is spent, and no path is foreclosed. Pressure remains static across the ridgeway journey, and coincidence (convenient shepherd, convenient girl with tablet) supplies complications without the courier's agency driving turns.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (prove objects absorb emotions) is signaled early but remains conceptual throughout. The frost-prism alignment and resulting light spread offer one meaningful tightening, yet the sequence unfolds without visible obstacle or trade-off—each step succeeds smoothly. The car engine spontaneously starting and the grief pulse arriving as passive sensation deny Liora agency; she does not choose, renounce, or endure with cost. The ending vow is summary rather than dramatized decision that narrows options, leaving escalation more atmospheric than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (send the message across impossible distance) is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Mara encounters no reversals or meaningful obstacles; each puzzle piece clicks into place "like a new warp thread," and the bead's light simply expands when placed. The resolution is not earned by protagonist agency but by completing a predetermined sequence. The "latent sacrifice" is named repeatedly but never tested—no on-page choice forces Mara to relinquish something concrete (a memory, a year of her life, her ability to leave the orchard) to power the thread.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"coax resilience from rubble"—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The blacksmith's descent and retrieval proceed without impediment; the stone "answered with a low hum" and the silk "slipped onto his arm as if recognizing his resolve." No reversal, cost, or narrowing of options appears. The final act (blade striking stone, vines growing) is a declarative outcome, not a choice under pressure. Escalation is absent; the journey is a quest-fetch without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: Lira spreads her maps, whispers a command, steps through, traces the thread, and retrieves the log without obstacle or cost. The revelation (commander evacuated only the elite) arrives as exposition; no on-page reversal forces Lira to weigh competing goods or pay a price. The crew's awakening is her unilateral act, not a choice that forecloses another path, so escalation flatlines under both Causal and Accumulative lenses.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the anonymous letter chain—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition emerges, no reversal tightens options, and no choice forecloses a path with cost. The wind moans, the lamp dies, yet Marek's ritual completes without friction. The fishing boat and his raised hand gesture toward connection but do not deepen or resolve the stated conflict. Pressure remains static; escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal narrows options; Mira and the herald perform their ritual without friction, and the storm obligingly steers itself. The newspaper-falling condition is met off-page with no dramatized consequence, and the final vow carries no legible trade-off or forfeited path. Escalation is ornamental: beams splitting, waves turning silver, constellations rearranging—all spectacle without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"to learn why some people magnetize stories"—is declared but never tested; Lira reaches a scroll that whispers the answer without resistance or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; each beat (tea, wing, scroll, garden, loom) simply adds ornament in and-then sequence. The "quietly explosive" energy and "iridescent caution" are labels without on-page consequence. Agency is absent: Lira observes, follows, and receives rather than deciding under pressure. The final loom-activation is a gesture with no visible cost or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—deconstructing the echo-grid—is signaled but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the sextant guides him through the job without friction, and "each filament he released floated upward" by convenience. The storm "softens" in parallel without causal linkage. The "measurable peace" is declared, not earned through a choice with visible cost. Coincidence (moonlight healing) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows options; Lira sings, light spreads, trees respond, visitors arrive, night softens in a linear accumulation without friction. The "forgotten songs" and "woven dawns" succeed immediately upon use, eliminating escalation. Agency is passive: outcomes unfold around Lira's ritual without her making a choice that forecloses an alternative or pays a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unearthing wisdom in a mistake—is declared but never tested on the page. The recluse faces no competing option, no time pressure forcing a trade-off, and no reversal that narrows his path. The curator asks why he came "to hide his own doubts," he answers, and the library rewards him immediately with the mirror-book. Coincidence (invitation slips through window, hatch opens onto the library) drives access without protagonist agency or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.6)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested under pressure. The protagonist's meditation on "tenuous absolution" is asserted thematically but never dramatized as a want in conflict with a cost or obstacle. The sequence—find bread, carry it, slice it, offer it to an empty chair—lacks escalation; each gesture is performed without resistance, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The ending invites future passersby rather than delivering an on-page reversal or tightening that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieve and activate the slide by measuring temperature/frequencies—is signaled early but unfolds without meaningful resistance or tightening. The chief's method works as planned; no reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows her options. The slide "fully awakens" without cost or sacrifice, and the "edge of oblivion receding" declares victory rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Textural lens, escalation should manifest as density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the prose remains uniform in register and the chief's actions face no constraint that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—thwart the rival crew's lantern theft and preserve the truce—is signaled early and pursued through one meaningful tightening (the barrel decoy and rope maneuver). Yet the escalation is brief: the scout lunges, Lila sidesteps, darkness ensues, and the elders validate her report without friction or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the truce holds "until sunrise" by design, not Lila's agency. The "comforting unease" recurs as a label rather than deepening pressure, and the ending offers reflection without visible cost or consequence that alters future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to learn why some people carry weather"—is signaled early but never escalates through a meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options. Arin's actions (calibrating the ring, tasting wind, watching carriers) are observational; no reversal or deepening forces a trade-off or alters his stance. The "convergence" and resulting "faint awe" are told outcomes without on-page cost or agency-driven pressure. No credible loss or renunciation forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity—is signaled early, but escalation is thin. Lena paints, the lock opens, she gains luminous ink; no reversal narrows options or imposes a trade-off. The lock's opening is triggered by symbolic alignment (mirror + portrait) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Pressure remains static from entry to resolution, with coincidence (the guardian's gaze, the lock's spontaneous shift) resolving rather than complicating.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring truth to a society that forgot it—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The calligrapher's refusal of the council is summarized in one line with no on-page consequence, and every subsequent discovery (doorway, bottles, vent) rewards her immediately. No reversal narrows options; the map assembles smoothly, the conduit opens, the vent surges on cue. The ending provides spectacle (sky healed, vines singing) but no visible price paid or path foreclosed under any lens. One whispered truth fixes the toxic sky, collapsing stake into convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening that narrows options occurs; the tuner tends his sculpture without friction, and the world "watches silently" in passive admiration. The piece declares stakes ("a promise... will not fade") yet provides no scene where those stakes face jeopardy or force a trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve because no conflict materializes to require resolution. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with cost) appears; the protagonist's routine continues unaltered.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving inner static—is signaled early but remains abstract. The controlled burn complication is introduced and resolved within two paragraphs with no reversal or cost; the dome's systems simply succeed when activated. No tightening or deepening narrows options; Vira's actions proceed in a linear checklist (approach box → whisper code → activate suppression → place box among seedlings). The "fragmented wholeness" she senses is told rather than tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—solving the locked mailbox mystery or proving listening heals—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Each action (lifting locket, hearing whisper, opening mailbox, reading letters, creating exhibit) succeeds immediately; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. The boy's request in the final beat offers potential pressure but resolves in two lines without complication. Agency is passive observation rather than decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—encrypting vulnerability—is declared but never tested by an opposing force or competing desire. Selene encounters no reversal, friction, or tightening; the dice clatter once and reveal the crystal without resistance. The tide rises and seals the door, but she sings it open immediately with no visible cost or foreclosed option. No escalation under any lens; the lab "learns to breathe" and "rose like a phoenix" as declared outcomes, not earned turns.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is signaled early, but no on-page tightening or meaningful reversal occurs. Mara's progression—brew, read grounds, enter chamber, exhume sand, press flower, gather fragments—unfolds without opposition, trade-off, or visible price. The "pockets of gravity shift" and "walls humming" are atmospheric descriptions, not escalations that narrow options. Coincidence (perfect spiral in grounds, correct symbol on slab) resolves the quest without protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication occurs; the ritual succeeds without obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off. The summoner's agency is ceremonial rather than decision-driven; she follows a script with no visible cost or forfeiture. Pressure is static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (learning the language of buildings) is signaled but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs—the tutor agrees to teach, sugar is borrowed without friction, and weekly sessions are arranged without obstacle. The "agreed upon lies" premise suggests potential tension but is neutralized immediately as both parties accept the deception. The resolution arrives through conversation and agreement rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early but never tested through a live trade-off or tightening. Lira performs ritual gestures (pressing the shell, lifting it at dawn, recording fragments) in sequence without opposition, cost, or escalation. No reversal narrows her options; the garden "breathes with her," the sunrise "promises," and the transformation is granted rather than earned. The seashell's "tragically radiant" glow and "ghostly resolve" are poetic mood rather than antagonistic pressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to forgive the unfinished"—is named early but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that forecloses an alternative. No reversal narrows Liora's options; she traces verses without impediment, and the sanctuary "holds her promise" without friction. The claimed "calibrated treason" and weaponization potential are told in summary ("she understood," "she chose") rather than dramatized through a decision with visible cost. Pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why people echo—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened or tested. The protagonist encounters no reversal, trade-off, or escalating cost: each step yields a new revelation without resistance, and the cavern grants the answer outright when she places the shell. Agency is absent at closure; luck and setting machinery solve the question she did not help create. The final "promise to carry this knowledge outward" involves no visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative, rendering the resolution inert under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—"salvage something pure from the wreckage"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening forces the whisperer to trade one good for another or foreclose a path. The piece catalogs dream fragments (compass, gull, shard) without reversal; each new image confirms the pattern rather than complicating it. Agency is observation plus a whispered invitation, not a decision under competing pressure. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence shows a visible price—no stamina spent, resource lost, or social credit burned—that charges the final image. One meaningful tightening is absent; applying −0.8 for escalation gap and −0.5 for cost opacity yields 4.6.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.1)
    The stated stake—"to appreciate hidden effort"—is philosophical rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the philosopher walks the parapet, whistles, returns the next evening in the same stance. The piece offers repeated atmospheric beats without escalation or a meaningful choice that narrows possibilities. Agency is purely observational.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the cursed diamond—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or trade-offs. Mira's progress is linear: she collects fragments, reassembles them, follows the map, and finds the diamond without complication or reversal. The "curse rumor faded" is told rather than dramatized through a tightening choice that forecloses an option. No visible price is paid; the stillpoint's revelation and the orchard's transformation occur as automatic consequences, not as results of agency under pressure. The story lacks escalation under any drive lens, remaining descriptive rather than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake ("forge variant allegiance / shape a new dawn") is declared early but never tested or tightened on the page. No live opposition appears; the scattered clans are rallied off-stage, Selene's prophecy arrives as static, and the storm never complicates tactics. The ending grants success ("the world below saw the first true sunrise") without visible cost or trade-off. Coincidence (the lightning converging, the drones singing, the sunrise blooming) resolves rather than complicates, violating the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—becoming a translator of ancestral music—is declared but never tested. The poet invents the glass-jar method without friction, fills jars without obstacle, and the child appears to validate the mission without prior complication. No reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (the child's arrival) provides resolution. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required, but pressure remains flat and the final moment carries no visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—protect the Heart from weaponization—is signaled early but never tested on the page; no storm-born seekers appear to create opposition. Elara's technical sequence (measure frequency, strike drum, unlock vault) unfolds without reversal, failed attempt, or visible price. The resolution is her own competence plus the artifact's cooperation, not a choice under pressure that forecloses an option. One meaningful tightening is absent; the piece accumulates steps without escalation or cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—sculpting patience from impatience—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; Elara observes, records, and waits, but the magnetic pulse and moon paths do not narrow her options or force a trade-off. The ending declares release ("unyoke," "small freedom") without showing what she renounced or what live option was foreclosed. Agency is absent; coincidence (the magnetic surge, the ice crack) delivers the resolution. The piece fails the 8.0+ guardrail: no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping seepage to prevent future deaths—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through observation and discovery, but the escalation is informational rather than agonistic; Mara encounters no meaningful obstacle or trade-off when she turns the valve. The resolution (water redirected, tunnel "breathing easier") is a logistical win without a visible personal cost or foreclosed option. One tightening occurs (the valve turn), but the absence of friction or sacrifice caps the band below strong.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—granting redemption via the mechanical heart—is stated early but never tested by opposition or cost. The chaplain encounters no obstacle: the shopkeeper agrees immediately, the repair succeeds on first attempt, and he departs with a gift and renewed conviction. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; the "vibrant hush" recurs as mood rather than pressure. Agency is present (he chooses to repair) but the act carries no visible forfeit, and coincidence (sunlight animating the heart) resolves the task rather than protagonist effort under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—ring the bell no one hears—is signaled early and pursued on the page. Mara engages the transliteration protocol, brushes the cradle, and the bell rings with algorithm satisfaction. Yet no live opposition or cost surfaces: the sea boils passively, the gears cooperate, and the climax is uncontested wish fulfillment. The prism setup for "next chapter" gestures toward escalation but occurs after closure, functioning as sequel tease rather than present tightening. Pressure remains static across the single action sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go—is signaled early and sustained. Lia's fabricated post is a clear choice that tests her theory, and the algorithm's response accelerates the search. However, the escalation is additive rather than a genuine tightening; each discovery simply leads to the next clue without forecloses options or imposing a visible price. The vault opens without friction, the crew's message appears without cost, and Lia's final act (re-posting the patch image) spreads the numbers again but does not trade away a live alternative or face an obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reconstituting the crystal—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through protagonist agency; the mirrors perform the work autonomously. No on-page reversal or complication narrows options; the protagonist places the fragment, watches reflections, and whispers intention without a trade-off or felt price. Escalation is asserted ("fragment's heart pulse in rhythm with her own resolve") rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—learning "the sound of approaching endings"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete trade-off or on-page reversal tests commitment. The protagonist joins volunteers, listens, walks back to cabin, and writes; each beat accumulates texture but does not narrow options or impose cost. The ending offers acceptance without renunciation or visible price—what was risked, what was lost? Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but the final whisper of gratitude does not reweigh earlier material with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging past romance and present vineyard through the letter's planting—is signaled early and maintained. No on-page reversal narrows options; the sentinel plants the scrap, the vines respond cooperatively, and the ending declares harmony without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Pressure reads as atmospheric assertion ("gently persuasive," "passionate subtlety") rather than causally driven escalation. The lack of a visible cost at closure and the absence of a tightening under the Accumulative lens keep the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to preserve wisdom—is signaled early but never tested by opposing pressure or a live trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the Keeper raises his hands, the clearing appears, the teaching occurs, and he departs as planned. Coincidence (the prophet's timely arrival) complicates atmosphere but not the protagonist's agency. The resolution is unopposed: the Keeper's understanding deepens off-page without a visible price, missed opportunity, or credible endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—collective healing—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara's setup proceeds without obstacle, villagers arrive on cue, and the resolution is additive (tears fall, smiles blossom) with no dramatized cost or trade-off. Coincidence drives the villagers' arrival ("drawn by the scent"), and the feather's symbolic glow replaces agency. No visible price is paid; the ending reiterates the mission statement rather than forecloses a path. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), pressure remains flat and escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("decode the pattern of growth") is signaled but never tested by a reversal or cost. Mara encounters no obstacle; the crystal "resists" observation in name only and then "answers her questions" without dramatized effort or trade-off. No agency-driven tightening appears—she observes, the crystal cooperates, she leaves. The "suspended hush shifted" is passive environmental change, not protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake: to locate chalk and capture "the sound of growing older." The prophet's quest proceeds through atmospheric steps—arranging driftwood, reaching the monolith, drawing with chalk, recording on cassette—but each beat feels successive rather than tightening. No on-page reversal or deepening choice narrows options; the chalk is found, the hum recorded, and the protagonist ends satisfied. The final image of chalk dust and the warming slab asserts resonance but lacks visible cost or a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or shift meaning; here it plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the spinning clock hand—is signaled early, but escalation consists of procedural steps (listen for the leaf, align gears, tighten screw) without a reversal or narrowing of options. The sage's competence never wavers; no credible loss, omission, or forced trade-off alters his tactics. The hand's slowing reads as inevitable success rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, and coincidence (the leaf's echo arriving at the exact moment) enables resolution without protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.6)
    The declared stake—"to execute a flawless goodbye"—is never tested by a reversal, complication, or competing need; Mara's ritual proceeds exactly as intended with no friction. The blood work result and Mr. Harlan's fragile heart are delivered as fait accompli rather than discovered or reacted to on the page, eliminating agency. No escalation occurs: each step (placing vinyl, playing harp, whispering reassurance) is additive ceremony without narrowing options or raising cost. Coincidence (the patient's death timing perfectly with the final chord) resolves the moment rather than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Lira's nights of tracing glyphs are summarized in a single sentence; no failed attempt, competing theory, or resource limit forces a tradeoff. The "sealed awakenings" and "spoons bend reality" backstory add flavor but do not pressure her method. The key emits a chime and the doorway opens on cue; luck does not complicate, and agency does not narrow options. The ending grants Lira "quiet joy" and encyclopedic knowledge without a visible price—no foreclosed path, no renunciation, no endurance cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—restore the scholar's body/truth—is signaled early but remains abstract and off-page (the scholar's soul "wanders," we never see him or feel urgency). Mara encounters no opposition, setback, or tradeoff during the repair; vertebrae "click" into place and the tooth "glows brighter" without friction or cost. The ending grants resolution without agency-driven escalation: she laughs, leaves, and writes in her study. No reversal, no tightening that narrows options, no visible price—pressure flatlines rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to share light without using fire"—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal or complication disrupts the steady procession from intention to fulfillment. The visitors' off-page response and her closing smile present resolution without dramatized cost, escalation, or a choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto grief—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. Lira's actions (placing stones, proffering the pendant) succeed immediately without complication; the moss responds, the interface awakens, the garden transforms. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows her options; coincidence (finding the interface) enables rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break with felt cost, but the story offers serial additions without sacrifice. The final spread of word online is told in summary, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—collecting shapes of hopes to stitch into prose—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. The novelist's "conflict" (doubt that "hopes were not hers to bind") is mentioned once and immediately abandoned without consequence. Moving "against the current" is metaphorical rather than tactical; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The act of gathering and recording proceeds without escalation or visible price; the final image declares resolve but does not demonstrate a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the valley's sacred practices—is signaled early but never narrows through genuine pressure or escalation. Mara's lyre-playing succeeds on first attempt; the vine unfurls, golden threads appear, and the moon cooperates without complication or reversal. No tactic is forced to shift, no resource is exhausted, and the cascade of pollen seals the covenant with zero visible cost or tradeoff. The final paragraph's teaching children reads as epilogue summary, not an on-page choice that forecloses a path or reveals a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—translating heartbeats into maps via safekept starlight—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the alchemist arranges debris, ignites the flash-paper, and the light settles exactly as intended with no complication. The piece offers escalation through poetic intensifiers ("burst," "cascade," "quiet triumph") but no on-page decision that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve because there is no conflict to resolve; the protagonist's patience and ritual succeed without friction, leaving no felt cost or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing echoes—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or failure. Corin's first attempt succeeds immediately ("the timer shivered, and a low hum rose"), removing pressure rather than escalating it. No reversal, tightening, or visible price alters tactics; the story adds more jars without complication. Agency is present (he makes the crystal, inserts it) but carries no felt trade-off or foreclosed path, leaving escalation absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—unbinding the grotto's sorrow—is declared but never tested. The weaver's process (align lamp, invite weights, absorb into flame) unfolds as ritual without opposition, cost, or a moment where she must choose between methods or endure a price. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the resolution (weights transmuted, grotto breathing, weaver departing) is granted by procedure rather than earned by agency under pressure. Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into a functional vessel—is signaled early but never tested by a competing desire or external obstacle. Mara encounters no resistance: the sap emerges conveniently, the glass pane seals it, the lantern glows as intended. The kettle boiling functions as a timer motif but does not tighten decisions; she completes the carving without time pressure forcing a trade-off. No meaningful reversal narrows her options. The resolution (understanding that "loss can be a tool") is declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with the ghost to trade regret for a glimpse of an abandoned path—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening. The ghost agrees immediately; no escalation forces Mara to sacrifice a live option. The "stories collected" mechanic operates as texture rather than escalating pressure. Cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—resurrect the terminal to create hope—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Every technical move succeeds: rerouted power lines light panels, servos whir, windows open, the beacon activates. No reversal or tightening occurs; the "hidden schematic" discovery adds information without complicating her task. Agency is present in her calculations and rerouting, but because no option is foreclosed and no price paid, escalation flatlines into a demonstration sequence. The carnival's "transient joy" versus engineered permanence could create ethical tension, but the story never dramatizes a choice between them.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (reconciling with the abandoned dream) is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, obstacle, or competing pressure forces the scribe to choose between wants or pay a visible price; he begins intending to inscribe and completes the task without friction. The claim that the dream "once haunted him like a bear in winter" remains abstract backstory, and the resolution—whispering gratitude and feeling the rhythm settle—is purely internal summary. Under Accumulative lens, no tightening or deepening alters his options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the architecture of lies"—is declared but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The lock opens through unexplained sundial alignment (no failure, no alternate path closed), and the "lies unravel" in passive metaphor. Coincidence (the sundial's "inner logic") solves the obstacle the protagonist did not help create. No reversal or deepening alters tactics; pressure remains static assertion rather than escalating constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (preserve ancient methods), but no on-page tightening or reversal tests it. The rope "clicks into place" without complication; the glass warms and he seals it, all frictionless. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The protagonist's agency is observation and ritual, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—mapping the geography of healing—is declared but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, complication, or cost narrows options; the traveler writes, the rose revives in his projection, and he continues unchanged. Agency is observation and notation, not decision with visible tradeoff. The ending ("ready to follow the map his own words had drawn") restates intent without dramatizing a price or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early but never tightened through genuine opposition or trade-off. The egg cracks conveniently, the phoenix rises without complication, and the mechanical world synchronizes instantly. No reversal or deepening forces the prince to choose between competing goods; luck and lyric assertion replace earned escalation. The resolution lacks visible cost: the prince's "flaw" simply "melts away" without dramatized renunciation or forfeiture that alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or complication occurs: Mira plans the graft, executes it without friction, and the desired outcome (villagers' gratitude, warmth in the sand) materializes by summary. The clouds' migration functions as atmospheric backdrop, not causal force. Agency is missing; Mira's ritual succeeds without a trade-off, sacrifice, or moment when an option is foreclosed. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, cost, or competing desire. Mara follows the breadcrumbs in a straight line; no reversal narrows her options, no tightening forces a trade-off. The box's "ancient reluctance" dissolves under "patient hands" without dramatized struggle, and the ending grants full success with no visible price. Pressure remains static throughout; the "defiant hush" is asserted in narration but not dramatized through on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to share light without using fire"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist executes her plan without friction. The sonar pinging grows louder and the garden responds cooperatively; no live choice forecloses a path. Agency is ceremonial performance, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping collective grief into a monument—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is spread across descriptive beats (spiral grows, ribbon unwinds) rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. The butterfly migration's "final wave" and the carved basin arrive as fulfillment, not reversal or deepening with visible cost. Mara's mentorship supplies information without opposition, and the family dinner ritual is told in summary. One meaningful turn occurs when Eliam "knelt, feeling the weight of each poem, each butterfly, each stone," but the act does not foreclose a live alternative or exact a felt price—he simply proceeds to carve. Coincidence (butterflies gathering at dusk) complicates texture but does not raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring "shared balance"—is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or narrowing options. Mara faces no reversal, complication, or cost; the inscriptions work, the pendulum resumes, she pledges to continue. No tightening or deepening alters tactics or knowledge; each beat is a paraphrase of ritual success. Agency is assertion without renunciation or trade-off. Under any lens, pressure flatlines from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a narrowing of options. No reversal occurs; the gardener proceeds from case to tapestry to map to epiphany without obstacle, mistake, or cost. The story asserts that Marlowe's map "could heal the wounded" and that intention "was a circle," but these claims are not dramatized through conflict or trade-off. Agency is observation and arrangement, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (steer the realm through famine) is declared but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the model forecasts problems, the cartographer drafts solutions, and all succeed without friction. The protagonist's agency is procedural execution rather than decision under duress. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does resistance appear—scholars are "skeptical at first" then immediately agree, engineers roll out barley, and the harvest succeeds as predicted.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (reviving the city's silent theaters via the pirate broadcast) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a meaningful tightening. The broadcast simply succeeds: Mara transcribes, the audience gathers, applause erupts. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible price paid. The "story famine" backstory sets context but does not create escalating pressure within the scene. Agency is procedural (copying, pressing play) rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.5)
    The declared stake—"to crystallize a fleeting emotion"—never faces on-page opposition or cost. She performs gestures, the gallery passively responds, and the emotion is announced as "solidified" without any tightening, trade-off, or sacrifice. No reversal, no deepening that changes options, no price paid. The rocking chair's stop is framed as a hinge but functions as ambient cue rather than causal trigger. Pressure is absent; closure is asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient waterworks methods amid competing narratives—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the narrator's discovery of the cog and sifting of sediment, but escalation is cerebral and told: "I agonize over which tale to champion" summarizes conflict rather than dramatizing it. The convergence of narratives and decision to document both is recounted in reflection without an on-page tightening that narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. No reversal or deepening moment where the narrator forecloses a path with felt cost; the ending offers resolution by declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (rekindling vanishing arts, bridging community grudges) is signaled early but lacks a meaningful tightening under pressure. The first chord instantly dissolves tension without resistance or complication; no reversal or deepening occurs. The ending summarizes weeks of teaching rather than dramatizing a peak choice or visible cost. Agency is passive: the teacher performs, others listen and transform, but no difficult tradeoff or foreclosed path is shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"create something beautiful from the ruins"—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or complication. No reversal or tightening occurs; the celestial alignment and knowledge fruit cooperate without friction. Mara's agency is performative (whispering, tasting, placing the seed) rather than choosing between live options with felt cost. The ending resolves through celestial event rather than protagonist decision. Pressure remains static; coincidence (alignment timing) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The matchbox riddle and key appear as gifts that Mara accepts without friction; no reversal forces her to trade one value for another. The drone's return and the echo's "answer" arrive through passive receipt rather than protagonist agency. Coincidence resolves the hive failure without dramatized struggle, and the ending's ceremony is described rather than earned through tactical sacrifice or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, no tightening, no reversal. The shard radiates hush without resistance, the elderly woman affirms the narrator's experience, and the ending grants sanctification without cost. Coincidence (finding the shard, its perfect effect) resolves the question the narrator never struggled to answer.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—"to welcome nuance into a certainty"—remains abstract and is never tested by genuine opposition or cost. The garden offers no resistance; every action succeeds without trade-off. The "cascading revelations" unfold as told summary rather than dramatized reversals that narrow options. No agency-driven tightening occurs; the statue simply executes its will telepathically, and the ending declares success without demonstrating a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("perpetual motion" and "capturing the texture of a missed opportunity") is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or resource scarcity. No reversal narrows options—the dice "stubbornly refused" until they don't, without cost or agency driving the shift. The "rupture" and "quivering" are told effects rather than earned escalation; Aric's "balancedly daring approach" is labeled but not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path. The piece reads as a series of assertions about a quest rather than pressure accumulating toward a decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake ("to prove that strangers remember kindness") is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. Mara paints, leaves notes, Jiro reads one and remembers—no reversal, no trade-off, no competing pressure. The "waxing moon" recurs but does not escalate options; Jiro's appearance is coincidental rather than a product of Mara's agency. One brief tightening when "the first sunrise threatened to flood" the rooftop, but the moment deflates immediately ("the hope she had sown stayed bright"). Cost is not legible; the ending loops back to "another night" without alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Liora performs one action (baking initialed bread) and the city responds unanimously with no friction, failure, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; the sequence is additive (bread → scent → thaw → rehearsal) without narrowing options or raising cost. Agency is minimal: Liora observes, whispers exposition, and lifts her lens, but does not choose between competing goods or endure a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("step beyond fate's design") is declared early but never tested with on-page friction. No reversals, no genuine tightening—the yoyo spins, the engine starts, the beacon lights, all without resistance or visible cost. The protagonist's "agency" is frictionless execution; nothing forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. Escalation is absent under the Causal lens; pressure should narrow options but instead every move succeeds immediately. The ending declares transformation ("his purpose fulfilled") without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to trick fear into revealing its weakness"—is declared but never tested through on-page choices that narrow options or impose trade-offs. Mara's actions (swallowing the clasp, placing it on the horse, whispering "vanish") are responses to the advisor's instructions rather than agency-driven decisions. No meaningful tightening or escalation occurs; the figure's dissolution feels coincidental rather than earned. The final bargain is offered but not answered, leaving stakes unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.6)
    No dominant stake is dramatized with an on-page test. The prophet's goal ("to turn obstacles into instruments") is declared but never meets resistance or choice that narrows options. The entire sequence is a single iteration without escalation—clouds arrive, he strikes, orchard responds, clouds depart—then the cycle is promised again. No reversal, no tightening, no visible price paid. Coincidence (cloud movements) drives every beat; protagonist agency is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: prevent the city from fossilizing by questioning the watchers. The mosaic discovery and whistle's second use provide a meaningful tightening that narrows Mira's path. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on felt cost, and here the resolution—"carry the pattern forward"—arrives without a visible trade-off or renunciation. The watchers' light-pattern answer and Mira's realization that the expedition "had become part of the pattern" feel like convenient revelations rather than choices that foreclose options, capping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"rescue truth from a pit of lies"—is declared but never tested. Arlen faces no opposition, dilemma, or cost; he opens the mailbox, reads the letter, and declares success. The letter's content aligns perfectly with his pre-existing thesis, offering no reversal or tightening. No trade-off is visible: the ivy retreats, the station warms, and truth is "rescued" without Arlen sacrificing belief, comfort, or clarity. The story lacks escalation under any lens; it is a procession of symbolic gestures without agency or price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—cataloging the pavilion's memory—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. Mara completes her task without reversal, trade-off, or cost; no on-page choice narrows options or forces sacrifice. The whispered vow is a continuation, not escalation. Agency is present (she acts), but the action lacks friction: no tool fails, no time pressure bites, no internal conflict forces renunciation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no density break or cadence shift reweights the stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—tracing honest origins to protect submerged knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful turn: the vault discovery that confirms the alternative hypothesis. Agency is present but muted; Mara's decisions feel like steps in a research protocol rather than choices that trade off live options. The council agreement and floating-light network arrive as convenient validation rather than hard-won consequence. Cost is declared thematically ("reclaimed stillness") but not dramatized as a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—folding grief into cranes to ease torment—is signaled early but never tested. The lantern maker encounters no resistance, failure, or trade-off; each step (polishing, folding, recording) succeeds without complication. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the process accumulates without escalation. The ending declares that "luminous torment ease[s], not disappear[s]," but this distinction is asserted rather than dramatized, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the visor lattice, the glowing fissure, and the geode's amplified resonance, but escalation feels additive rather than dialectical. The protagonist's agency is primarily observation and calibration; the palm-thrust at the climax is a ritualized gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The "bleak exhilaration" at the end asserts a state rather than demonstrating a trade-off or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—"decode the frequency of belonging"—remains abstract throughout; no live on-page cost or tradeoff shapes Lira's actions. She follows trails, presses a lever, and achieves total success without complication, refusal, or price. The pilgrim's prior work has already "unlocked the observatory's dormant memory," leaving Lira with an execution task rather than a conflict-driven choice. No tightening, deepening, or reversal occurs; pressure is declared ("thicker with brilliant dimness") but never dramatized as constraint or loss. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing needed resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—quelling guilt by uncovering a withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens when the carvings align into the phrase. Agency is present in the sifting action and the final act of setting down the watch hand. However, escalation is thin: the journey and discovery unfold without meaningful resistance, reversal, or cost that alters tactics; the sea "acknowledges" rather than opposes, and the resolution (lifting the weight) is delivered by the carvings rather than forced by protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—prisoner release—is declared but never tested; no complication forces a trade-off or narrows options. The negotiator whispers apology, offers the box, the other man nods, they agree to release at dawn, all without friction. Moon-phase synchronization is mentioned but never constrains an attempt. No reversal or tightening occurs; the waning crescent "marks the schedule" passively. Coincidence of mutual agreement resolves the exchange without protagonist agency driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping regret and achieving alignment—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested throughout. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the protagonist paddles into open water without obstacle, doubt, or cost that alters his course. The past betrayal is summarized but does not generate present friction. Agency is descriptive rather than decisional: he "felt," "realized," "whispered" without a single choice that forecloses an option or imposes visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—kindling empathy in a cold world—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or cost. The protagonist follows clues (newspaper line → crate → mirror) without opposition or tightening; each discovery affirms the goal rather than complicating it. The decision to toss the baseball is presented as a symbolic act, not a trade-off that forecloses another path. No visible price narrows options or changes tactics. The accumulative design might support a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of friction or escalation keeps this in the functional band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (reforging bond with Arion) is declared but never genuinely threatened or tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Liora gathers spices, mixes them, and the metamorphosis completes without opposition or cost. The "reluctant" label is asserted but not dramatized—she proceeds without hesitation or visible sacrifice. Escalation is absent; the story moves in a straight line from intent to fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"cloudbound repentance" to "soothe the unborn sighs"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The cartomancer performs a sequence of gestures (kneel, unfasten, whisper, place droplet) without encountering resistance, trade-off, or a moment where success/failure hinges on her choice. No escalation: the crack widens, then heals itself; the vapor rises; the blossom appears—all without agency-driven turns. The ending grants resolution (twins sleep, world will mend) via environmental magic rather than protagonist decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (open the locked dimension) is declared but never narrowed by on-page reversal or cost. Nara presses the crystal, the veil tightens, she smiles, gravity loosens, the seam cracks—each step succeeds without trade-off or complication. No choice forecloses an alternative path; the sequence reads as a to-do list rather than escalating pressure. The pacifist vow is invoked but never challenged by a concrete temptation or threat that would test it with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is asserted but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the fisherman's arrival and firefly release unfold without opposition or cost. The ending claims "uncanny timing" and charitable miracles without showing a single tactical shift or price paid. Coincidence resolves rather than complicates, and agency is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is declared but never tested by genuine opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows Kael's options; he moves freely through corridors, decodes at will, and the device succeeds without complication. The garrison's transformation is summarized in a single sentence with no dramatized resistance, doubt, or trade-off. Agency is absent: coincidence (the cradle's automatic effect) resolves the declared goal, and no on-page price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to understand sacred patterns"—is declared early but never tested by a live obstacle or cost. Selene places rocks in sequence, the dust ignites, the tide pauses, and the patterns "unfold in countless tides" without any reversal, complication, or trade-off. The precognitive curse is framed as potential trap ("feared the visions would trap her") but immediately dissolves: "her motivation to understand sacred patterns outweighed the terror," a tell-only assertion that skips the conflict. No on-page tightening or deepening narrows options; the flame spreads "downstream" without resistance, and the story closes on assurance ("knowing she had turned a lingering promise into a living map") rather than a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dominant stake ("to map the invisible cartography of scars") declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The poet performs his ritual unopposed; the timer clicks, the envelope opens, the storm softens—no reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible price paid on the page. The ending summary ("travelers… discovered," "generations toward compassion") recounts legacy rather than showing a single, earned escalation with cost. No agency forecloses a path; the vigil completes exactly as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to turn questions into destinations"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. The duel itself is told in summary; no reversal or tightening narrows options. The philosopher's "final move" and the diplomat's bow occur without prior escalation or visible cost. No agency decision, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path on the page; coincidence (the overture "resolving into a chord") appears to grant victory.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.4)
    The declared stake—"to forge beauty from anarchy"—is abstract and never tested on the page through a choice that forecloses a live option. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the piece summarizes a year of work without depicting a moment where success is in doubt or a price must be paid. The resolution is convenience summary: "the library glowed with lanterns," "travelers arrived," with no protagonist agency driving the turn. Pressure is absent; escalation is replaced by declarative accretion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.6)
    Dominant stake ("surprise fate with an unplanned encore") is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options; the pianist ascends unopposed and plays without obstacle. Coincidence (horizon accepts night, compasses align) drives the resolution. No visible cost or trade-off at closure—"fate, caught off guard" is assertion, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening the seed before the monsoon—is signaled early. However, the escalation reads as a checklist (name jade vine, orchid, petals) without a live reversal or tightening that narrows options. The "luminous doubt" arrives two beats before success and is immediately converted into "the engine of her resolve," defusing tension rather than forcing a trade-off. No on-page cost alters Mara's tactics; the seed sprouts after the incantation without resistance, and the monsoon remains offstage, so the timeframe's pressure is asserted but not tested. The resolution is a fulfillment rather than a choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing the island's sorrow—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The tutor recites instructions and the compass "responds" without resistance, ambiguity, or cost. Escalation is absent; the narrative moves through assertion rather than pressure. No live option is foreclosed, and coincidence (the compass simply aligns) substitutes for agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of preventing famine is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the Causal lens, with meaningful tightening in the puzzle solve and vault access. Cost is legible in the effort and symbolic wall collapse, but the absence of on-page antagonistic pressure or internal conflict slightly limits escalation depth. Protagonist-driven choices narrow options credibly, though stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mara's agency in collecting absences and using the forge, tightening the stake of finding trust's sound.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake of overcoming fear escalates under causal lens through Mara's agency in decoding and stepping on the lever. Cost is legible in the vial's price of self-betrayal.

However, the escalation relies heavily on atmospheric accumulation rather than causal turns, slightly limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Mirela's agency under the accumulative lens, such as smudging the illustration and adjusting the barometer, which deepens the stake of finding truth.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from deciphering the yoyo to initiating the beacon. Dominant stake (stepping beyond fate) tightens with each beat, and cost is legible in the "bleak exhilaration" and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes around preventing fossilization escalate through Mira's agency in decoding patterns and using the whistle, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in her resolved vow, but the escalation relies on pattern density rather than causal tightening, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Arlen's agency under accumulative lens, from finding the letter to realizing parallels and acting. Cost is visible in the transformation, narrowing options. Stakes are dominant and coherent, though one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of detail and Mara's agency in placing notes and vowing to return.

However, the escalation lacks a decisive causal turn, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as sifting through carvings deepens the internal stake of guilt versus redemption.

Pressure coheres from the summoned journey to the climax, with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: offering the box and untethering rope narrow options under causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in "weight lift" and memory of past lives. Stakes tighten meaningfully from apology to forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency in paddling forward, deepening the internal stake; cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of sorrow and the riding of regrets as a tide. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of being drowned by past regrets.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the emotional weight and decision to toss the baseball; stakes deepen through symbolic encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (unfastening, whispering, following the vapor), tightening the stake of healing grief with unmistakable cost. The density increase from crack to staircase to healing reweights options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Nara's agency under the accumulative lens, with her emotional shifts affecting gravity to advance the stitching. The cost is visible in the "weight of sorrows" and the foreclosed option of staying. Stakes are abstract but deepened through specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes around understanding transformation escalate through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the fireflies' release. The fisherman complicates stakes, but coincidence doesn't resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake of silent revolution escalates through Kael's agency under the causal lens, from decoding to activation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the poet's agency in setting the timer and performing the vigil, under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the rarefaction of sorrow. Stakes are clearly signaled and deepen through the storm's intensity, but the pressure lacks a tightening turn that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens, with each fencing move guided by sundial angles tightening the conflict. The stake of turning questions into destinations is clear, but the cost is more intellectual than visceral, limiting emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding and planting seeds, reweighting stakes with visible cost. Dominant stake of resistance is signaled early and tightens through collective action. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with the timeframe until night tightening decisions; cost is unmistakable as compasses turn to stars and fate is rewritten. Dominant stake (surprising fate) deepens through meaningful cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (protecting cultural memory) escalates through Mara's agency in dream interpretation, tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the monsoon threat and seed's fragility. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options, driven by protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal—whether Mara can truly commit to quiet, evidence-driven humility rather than grandiosity—and is signaled but only lightly stressed. External conflict is virtually absent; the storm and flood are past, and nothing actively resists her observational project. Escalation appears only as gradual deepening (humidity shifts, cracks widening), which supports the concept but never forces a hard trade-off or loss. This keeps tension low and makes the “cost” of her chosen stance more implied than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elya can rebuild her art and sense of purpose after the fire—is stated, but it faces little on-page resistance. Once she decides to follow the ledger and frost, every step succeeds without setback, moral dilemma, or real risk, and the abandoned mine conveniently contains exactly what she needs. This produces a gentle deepening rather than a felt tightening or trade-off; no path is truly foreclosed. The resolution is more contemplative than pressured, leaving the conflict underdeveloped for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—turning traumatized silence into sustaining music—is clear, but pressure is gentle and largely uncontested. There’s a mild deepening when the device begins to transform not only Mara but visiting survivors, yet no on-page risk that it might fail, backfire, or cost her something tangible. Escalation reads more as gradual enrichment of a state than as narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The ending is satisfying in tone but feels relatively low-tension for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marlow can transform the drowned library into a place of rest for the dead—is clear, but pressure never genuinely tightens. Marlow encounters no resistance; once he decides to use the broken lens, every step proceeds smoothly to success, with no real trade-offs or jeopardized options. Internal conflict (duty vs. peace) is gestured at but not dramatized into hard choices that cost him something concrete. As a result, the piece is beautiful and coherent but relatively low in felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—feeding the exiles without drawing patrol attention—is clear early but remains mostly at a conceptual level. There is a gentle escalation from planning to first-month success to an ongoing ritual, but no beat where an option is visibly foreclosed or a hard trade-off is forced. The bell’s nightly ringing and the volunteers’ departures are described as risky but never encounter resistance or real complication. As a result, tension is soft and steady rather than tightening toward a decisive test.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether unused love can be found and liberated—is clear, and there is one noticeable tightening when the map resolves to a single heart-shaped node and he must commit to opening the veil. However, there is almost no resistance: the tear responds, the tunnel opens, and the transformation succeeds without real risk, failure, or moral friction. As a result, tension is more meditative than pressurized, and the healing feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is primarily conceptual: can Mara design a maze that dissolves boundaries between memory and moment. The stakes are largely aesthetic/philosophical, with no felt risk if she fails beyond an abstract frustration. The child’s brief choice at the bifurcation is visually striking but never reads as a pressured, consequential decision; the garden seems benevolent and success is all but guaranteed. As a result, escalation feels gentle and atmospheric rather than tense, limiting emotional investment despite the rich conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing the seed vault to avert famine—is clear and weighty, and the piano-bench puzzle functions as the main on-page obstacle and tightening. However, after the bench opens, the rest of the journey is relatively unopposed: the guardians foretold never act, and the vault opens without serious resistance or hard trade-offs. The external conflict therefore feels too smooth for the declared scale of the stakes, with tension mostly carried by atmosphere rather than true jeopardy. The internal conflict is subdued, so escalation never quite reaches the pressure implied by global famine and last-chance seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering and encoding the sound of trust breaking—is present, but pressure scarcely escalates: once the forge is lit, success feels assured. There are no meaningful obstacles, trade-offs, or reversals; each step (coral shard, lullaby, full chord) proceeds smoothly. Internal conflict (“should I bear this grief?” vs. “I must complete the device”) is not dramatized as a genuine dilemma with cost. As a result, the piece is texturally rich but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—securing and then repurposing the moonbeams—never faces real jeopardy or opposition, internal or external. Each “challenge” (flower code, hidden tunnels, jade door) yields on first touch, without reversal or trade-off. Lira’s internal conflict between thief and preserver is conceptually present but not meaningfully dramatized through difficult choices. As a result, escalation is more a steady unveiling of wonders than a tightening of pressure with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s attempt to create genuine safe zones and to reconceive control as nurture—remains largely internal and untested. There is no external opposition, no resource scarcity, and no moment where her project is imperiled or her resolve meaningfully strained. The “abandoning” of quick safety is presented as an assertion rather than a pressured decision, so escalation reads as tonal accumulation rather than genuine narrowing of options. As a result, tension is gentle and consistent, but it never really tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can confront her fear and accept a perilous transformation—is clear and coheres with the lever’s threat and the vial’s price. Escalation moves from atmospheric unease to a concrete risk (collapsing aisle) and an internal moral trade-off (betrayal of her hidden self). Still, obstacles prove easy to overcome: the cipher decodes smoothly, the mechanism holds after one decisive step, and the cost of taking the courage is largely conceptual. Tension never quite peaks into true doubt about her success or survival.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether an endless night can be mapped in a way that truly guides—is present but remains largely conceptual rather than emotionally or practically pressured. Escalation comes through intensifying storm, the narrowing to a single star, and the final question on the last page, which nudges him into sealing the map with his breath. However, there’s little sense of alternative options or a real dilemma; nothing concrete is lost besides the physical map itself. The conflict feels more like a meditative inquiry than a sharp testing of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—understanding where thoughts come from—is present but never feels risky or opposed; failure would carry no visible loss beyond mild curiosity. The main “escalation” is the robot deciding to interface with the violin and then recording the droplets, which is more procedural than pressured. There’s no real resistance, ethical tension, or threatened duty to sharpen the experiment into conflict. As a result, the piece is textured but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the town’s mistrust can be thawed through this luminous, non-accusatory mechanism—is clear but remains largely abstract. Conflict is almost entirely one-sided: there’s no strong opposing force on the page, and Mara never faces a hard trade-off or genuine risk in activating or continuing the practice. The appearance of the skeptical mayor hints at pressure but resolves immediately into validation instead of escalation, so tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—re-establishing a truthful, reciprocal bond with the garden—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and low-friction. There is a gentle escalation (humming ground, glowing pathways, confrontation with the oak, then the secret clearing), but almost no sense of real risk that the pact might fail or that his effort might be rejected. His agency is continuous (choosing to polish, to promise, to kneel), yet consequences read as guaranteed reward rather than earned outcome under pressure. The result is a pleasing arc, but not a tense or hard-won one.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—proving her hypothesis about time—is intelligible but low-pressure, and nothing on the page seriously threatens failure or harm. Escalation is mostly a matter of increasing sensory intensity (amber arcs, spirals of light, unfurling buds) rather than narrowing options or raising cost. Lira’s key act—pulling the lever—is never contested internally or externally, so the “choice” carries little tension. As a result, the story reads as a beautifully described successful test rather than a conflict with meaningful stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will interpret and enact the ghost’s code to release the trapped aria—is clear but gently expressed. There is a single meaningful tightening when the water-etched lines glow and demand a “single, sustained note,” forcing her to act rather than passively observe. However, opposition is soft, and consequences of failure are more implied atmosphere than concrete loss, so pressure never truly bites. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—can she externalize and measure the internal weight of a lie—is clear, but it remains largely internal and contemplative, with little sense of alternative outcomes or genuine risk. Her actions (smudging ink, adjusting the barometer, stepping out into the wind) proceed without reversals or setbacks, so pressure doesn’t really escalate; knowledge deepens, but options never meaningfully narrow. The final stance shift is earned conceptually rather than through on-page testing of her commitment. This keeps the piece affecting but relatively low-tension compared to elite short fiction standards.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will quantify and perhaps disturb the “swallowed truth” or leave it buried—is clear but remains largely conceptual. There is a mild tightening as he derives the numeric pattern and realizes the wheel is engineered to balance that hidden mass, followed by his renunciatory choice to leave it. Yet there is little sense that any real danger or irreversible consequence hinges on that choice in the now; no concrete risk, opposition, or moral bind escalates beyond the initial premise. The tension operates more as eerie curiosity than true pressure, limiting conflict/stakes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the keeper can be psychically renewed without abandoning his witnessing role—is present but remains abstract. Pressure increases texturally as he moves closer to the refuge and the silence intensifies, yet there’s almost no resistance, risk, or felt alternative; he is drawn and simply goes. The key choice (entering the refuge) is underplayed and seems inevitable, missing an opportunity for internal friction or a visible price. As a result, escalation feels more like steady deepening of mood than a true tightening or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain mostly abstract: will this be a meaningful, wonder-nurturing experience for the community. There is no real opposition or risk; the eclipse comes as planned, the harp works flawlessly, the crowd receives the music without friction. The only nod to pressure is Liora’s blend of awe and “professional responsibility,” which never forces a trade-off or hard choice. As a result, escalation is gentle and tonal rather than truly testing her goal or values.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the mystery of the displaced axis—is present but largely intellectual and unopposed. Escalation is mostly a deepening of strange phenomena (humming, vibration, pulsing glyphs) rather than an increase in risk, cost, or narrowing options. The descent to the chamber is a structural tightening, yet the path remains frictionless, with no sense that failure or harm is possible. As a result, the climax reads as a successful experiment more than a pressured, hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared (quiet revolution, secrets vs. fate), but there is almost no real opposition or risk on the page; nothing threatens to stop him or punish failure. The “last orders” from the network and his new mission are never tested against a counterforce, so escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic. His decision to weaponize the fortunes is treated as an untroubled inevitability, not a trade-off. As a result, tension remains low and the revolution feels costless.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (the veil shattering vs. sealing, the city’s safety, potential possession of the priest) are clearly named and track through the piece. There is escalation in the deepening loop, the anchor’s strengthening pull, and the sense of a ticking clock. Yet conflict remains mostly one-sided and ritualistic—no tangible resistance, near-failure, or hard trade-off tests his commitment; his final “spear” chord succeeds without genuine doubt. The price of success is therefore conceptual rather than sharply felt, keeping the tension effective but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely internal—will Lian remain trapped in longing or transform it into creative agency—and that core is clear but under-pressurized. There’s no real counterforce or possibility of failure on the page; once she begins, the ritual proceeds smoothly to success with no meaningful setback or sacrifice. The supposed temporal pressure (“Before exhaustion hits”) never bites into her options. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady amplification of imagery than a tightening of conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can “conquer the labyrinth of self” by integrating fractured timelines—is clearly stated but plays out with minimal visible escalation. The algorithm generating new corridors and responsive doors gestures at rising pressure, yet we never feel a moment where a real option closes or a meaningful trade-off must be made; the path feels fated rather than contested. The main “turn” is the realization that he must accept all versions of himself, but it arrives as a declarative insight rather than as the product of a hard-won decision under duress. As a result, tension is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake—Marin’s fight against emotional numbness—is legible from the outset, and the shift from reversed to forward songs provides a clear structural deepening. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with little real possibility of failure or alternative path; once she performs the known ritual, success feels almost guaranteed. The “cost” is mainly the discomfort of confronting her own stillness, which is more asserted than sharply dramatized. As a result, pressure escalates gently rather than urgently, limiting the intensity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—getting truth beyond a quarantine while preserving integrity—is conceptually strong, but on-page conflict is notably soft. The quarantine constraint leads to one tactical adaptation (using the shaft), which succeeds without resistance, risk, or visible sacrifice. The earlier hint of being followed never escalates into an active threat, so pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten. As a result, the piece reads as a contemplative vignette more than a fully pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Arlen’s need to understand and live with scent-triggered grief, which is signaled early and paid off in his final decision to catalog and map those reactions. Pressure escalates primarily through intensification of sensory experience rather than reversals: the perfume unspools more and broader memories, deepening the emotional weight. There is a clear stance crystallization—accepting grief as something to study, not evade—but the piece lacks a sharp on-page trade-off or foreclosed alternative path. As a result, tension feels consistently low-key rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—how he will respond to the pressure of time, memory, and the rope’s history—is present, and there is one meaningful tightening at the “final fork,” where he must either release the rope or bind it. However, many earlier “impossible choices” (fireflies vs lantern, each fork’s song) are mentioned rather than dramatized with concrete alternatives and consequences, so they don’t feel like true escalations. The final decision is ethically and thematically interesting but emotionally low-pressure; he chooses with a “smile” and little sense of loss beyond a conceptual note about the escaped soul. As a result, the conflict functions but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the chronic hush can be transformed through story and music—is clear but under-pressured. Escalation is mostly tonal: from quiet gathering to rising melody to communal resonance, without a real narrowing of options or a moment where the attempt might fail. The protagonist never faces a trade-off or visible loss; she simply does the intended thing and it works. As a result, the resolution feels graceful but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully capturing and bottling a counterfeit emotion for sale—is declared but never meaningfully threatened. The ritual proceeds smoothly with no resistance, misstep, or real cost, so pressure does not escalate; the faint chime simply signals a foregone conclusion. The courier’s arrival promises future work rather than tightening current stakes. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully rendered procedure more than a conflicted scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are emotionally framed (returning a last token of family love; honoring unseen contributors) but experience almost no on-page resistance. Mara decides to go to the lighthouse, is warmly received, and every subsequent plan (placing the locket, creating the register, organizing the ceremony) unfolds without friction or trade-off. The only “tightening” is conceptual—a deepening realization about compassion—but nothing forces a difficult choice or loss. This keeps the piece gentle and pleasant but limits tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Arlen can forge a felt sense of communal belonging—is present and thematically tied to the orchard’s ache, but it never truly sharpens into a risk with consequences for failure. The shared search and weaving of reeds offer escalation in a ritualistic, textural sense rather than through concrete opposition or difficult trade-offs. Arlen’s vow to dedicate the arbor is framed as an unproblematic good, without competing goods or evident cost. The late realization with Lira deepens meaning but doesn’t substantially tighten pressure, keeping conflict gentle and largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—locating the place where echoes are born and resolving the city’s interrupted cadence—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when she chooses to descend the light staircase. Still, pressure is gentle: there’s no real resistance, failed attempt, or moral dilemma beyond a lightly handled sacrifice of the pendant. As a result, escalation reads as a steady unveiling of wonders rather than goal-threatening complication. The final act does resolve the central problem, but with little sense of risk that it might fail.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict and stakes remain highly abstract: the goal is understanding ambiguous loss, but there is no meaningful opposition, deadline, or risk of failure on the page. The “escalation” is mostly the orchard cooperating more deeply with his ritual, which reads as smooth revelation rather than pressured change. The insight that grief plus hope leads to new growth is not bought with a visible sacrifice or dilemma. As a result, tension stays low and the piece functions more as a contemplative vignette than a story with live stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Maren’s quest to become visible by restoring a sense memory—is articulated but never truly pressured. There is no real opposition or plausible failure mode; following the metallic resonance to the spindle reads as linear completion, not an escalated test. The outage is framed as urgency but never forces a trade-off or difficult choice. As a result, the piece has tension in concept rather than in enacted conflict, keeping stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the leaf will transform, and what that teaches Marlowe about intervention—remains fairly abstract and low-pressure. The main tightening is Marlowe’s decision to use the copper coil/mycelium indirect method rather than force change, but this is not strongly framed as risky or costly. Once that choice is made, the narrative mostly waits for the leaf to comply, without reversals or complications. As a result, tension stays gentle and meditative rather than building toward a truly consequential inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—trading deeply personal art for a convergence that may heal the island—is strong in concept but under-pressured on the page. The main tightening is the offer itself; after that, Mara’s acceptance is immediate, with little sense that she might refuse or that the sacrifice could backfire. External opposition is absent and internal conflict is mostly implied, so tension relies on atmosphere rather than real option-narrowing. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth revelation than a hard-earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain gentle and largely abstract: the pilgrim’s “simple prayer for safe passage” is granted almost immediately and without resistance, and Lira faces no true test or trade-off. Pressure does increase texturally as the cave’s song crescendos and more miracles occur, but nothing seriously threatens failure or loss. The key turn—a shift in how Lira and the cave relate to “unseen forces”—is intellectual and serene, not wrestled toward under duress. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady glow than a tightening coil.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can turn scattered maritime memories into shared meaning—is present but largely abstract, with minimal direct opposition or narrowing of options. The main tightening is the shift from solitary harbor work to answering the shout to retrieve a legend, which does modestly raise the scale of his task. There is little sense of risk or loss if he fails, and no clear antagonist or friction beyond distance and implied seas. As a result, tension is more contemplative than pressing, which limits escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching and understanding the fortress—is clear, and there is a gentle escalation as she moves deeper underground. Yet nothing meaningfully resists her: every mechanism yields on first try, and there is no moment where she must trade one value or risk for another. The “dare” is declared but never truly tested; as a result, tension stays low-grade and the cost of success remains abstract. Functional but not competitive at the highest level for conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Lira’s attempt to “sculpt space for reflection,” essentially a quest for a usable inner and outer sanctuary, and the main conflict is her skepticism contending with the tile’s numinous behavior. Pressure does deepen slightly as the tile reveals ancient verses about loss and hope and she commits to transcribing and then preserving the conduit. However, escalation is gentle and never truly forecloses alternatives or tests her resolve; she never considers abandoning the process or misusing the tile. The resolution works conceptually but feels low-pressure, limiting the sense of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the immortal remains in numbing stasis or risks a reconfigured existence—exists but stays largely abstract. The main “turns” (amulet activation, corridor formation, twin’s statement) happen with little resistance or competing desire on his part, so options never feel meaningfully narrowed. As a result, tension is low and the cost of stepping forward at the end is more inferred than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—providing proof to secure political asylum—is stated clearly, and the internal process of waiting for the breach provides a modest tightening as grief thickens and the ink begins to glow. However, the conflict remains largely uncontested; no counterforce (internal panic, risk of exposure, or failure mode) meaningfully pressures Mara’s tactics. The climax (the ink writing the contract and the commission’s response) unfolds smoothly without a hard trade-off or visible loss, so the stakes feel conceptual rather than visceral. As a result, escalation is present but muted for a piece aiming at elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain mostly abstract: the town is silent, and his goal is to “collect the textures of different times,” but nothing on the page actively resists him. There’s no clear escalation—his process at night, at dawn, and later in the day feels continuous rather than tightened or tested. The eventual notion that the town’s future voice will be “woven from the many invented histories he had nurtured” suggests high conceptual stakes but never materializes as on-page pressure. The result is a beautifully textured vignette with minimal dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will remain a non-entity or claim a purpose as keeper of erased histories—is legible and resolved. Pressure escalates modestly via the label revealing numbers, then murals, then the realization of what he can do. However, this progression lacks a real pinch: there’s no moment where he seriously hesitates, risks anything tangible, or must choose between conflicting values. As a result, the conflict reads contemplative rather than tense, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Selene can “decode” the universal riddle of why myths endure—is clearly signaled but remains largely intellectual and unthreatening. There is a modest escalation as the shell activates the cello, leads her to the ledger, and culminates in the spinning compass and bright chord, yet no real option is foreclosed or price paid. Internal conflict (skeptical myth-buster vs. yearning for wonder) is implied but never dramatized into a genuine dilemma. The resolution is less a tested choice than a graceful thematic landing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—community autonomy versus corporate privatization—is clear early and tied to Mira’s mission. Pressure does build as she decodes the chip, organizes covert meetings, and orchestrates a visible spatial reordering before the investors arrive. However, resistance is mostly abstract or off-stage (investors “prepare their legal briefs,” the council is receptive), so escalation feels relatively smooth and low-friction, with limited on-page cost or real risk of failure. Mira’s dual loyalty is named as a tension but doesn’t force a visibly painful trade-off in any particular moment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last image of a historically and emotionally precious sand grain before it’s reclaimed—is clear and present throughout. Pressure tightens modestly as the sun approaches the crater rim and the chemical reaction begins its countdown, but everything unfolds smoothly with no true test, reversal, or foreclosed option. His agency is mostly in careful preparation rather than in responding to active threat or uncertainty. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative rather than tense, which blunts escalation despite the beautiful framing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—getting the hummingbird flightworthy in time to support the maiden voyage—is present but feels low-pressure because the repair proceeds almost entirely without setback or hard trade-off. The anchor’s ascent could function as a ticking clock, yet it never forces a compressed or compromised choice; the patch holds on the first try, and no alternative path is foreclosed. Internal conflict (e.g., fear of failure, doubt about data) is hinted at but never dramatized into a meaningful tightening. As a result, tension remains gentle and textural rather than escalating toward a charged decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will act on the strange guidance and successfully send a message about the rivers’ beginning—is present but remains abstract and low-friction. Escalation is mostly textural: the condensation becomes legible, the transmitter hums, the bell tolls, the ice cracks; there’s little direct resistance or costly trade-off. Her “worrying tranquility” hints at internal conflict, yet she encounters no real obstacle or dilemma that forces a sacrifice. As a result, the ending feels resonant but not sharply tested, with change foretold more than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will be revived—is declared, but it’s never genuinely in doubt; once the fork touches dust, everything proceeds smoothly. There are no obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs in the rebuilding process; pressure does not tighten so much as unfold. The tuner never has to choose between competing goods or costs, and no one resists or complicates the ritual. As a result, the piece feels more like a lyrical vignette than a story with escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (rescue/survival vs. accepting the temple’s price to realize a larger purpose) is present, and there is one clear tightening when Mara decides to let the beacon fade. However, the earlier statements of time pressure and battery loss don’t escalate meaningfully and the external danger remains abstract; we never truly feel she might not make it back. Internal and external conflicts are aligned but not deeply in tension, so the renunciation feels noble more than costly. Tension hums but rarely sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—redeeming his false-warning legacy by uncovering and guiding others to the bodies—is clear, and there is a basic escalation from cell to hidden corridor to reef and rising bodies. Yet external conflict is nearly absent: no guards, no environmental hazard that truly threatens him, no serious risk of failure once the lattice activates. Internal tension around fear, doubt, or moral conflict (“disturbing” the dead, exposing truths) is more implied than dramatized, so the resolution feels gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can discharge an ancient debt—is present throughout and culminates in a clear tightening when she must convert her love into venom, paying with her own continued existence. However, opposition and risk mostly remain implicit; there’s little resistance or uncertainty about her path, so the tension is more tonal than truly pressured. Escalation is therefore more a steady deepening of ritual than a sharpened conflict with visibly narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—transforming ruin into reverence—is clear but remains largely abstract and unopposed. “Broken precedents” and guild laws are invoked, yet we never see any real conflict, setback, or price beyond the claim that she needed courage to break them. Escalation is more about increasing luminosity and accumulated images than about tightened pressure or narrowed options. As a result, the resolution feels serene rather than earned under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring the altar to revive a lost channel between living and dead—is stated clearly but rarely comes under real threat. The “pressure” is mostly atmospheric; the orchard is cautious but never truly resistant, and Mara does not face meaningful alternatives or sacrifices. Escalation is a gentle deepening (roots reacting, light growing, final chime) rather than a tightening that narrows options. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative and low-risk, limiting tension and emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—investing a letter and surface mail with charged meaning—remains largely conceptual and unopposed; no real risk of failure or meaningful trade-off ever sharpens it. Events proceed smoothly from intention to successful ritual with no genuine reversals or narrowing of options. Agency is present but untested, so “success” feels inevitable, not earned. The result is gentle tension at best, more meditative than truly conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncover and transmit the truth about the coup before it happens—is present and escalates conceptually as she discovers bribery, falsified votes, etc. However, conflict remains largely frictionless: the candle readily “obliges,” there’s no resistance from conspirators, and no on-page threat to the courier or to her work. The main tightening is informational rather than pressure-based; options don’t visibly narrow, and she never faces a real trade-off or risk. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than urgent despite the coup clock.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The core stake—whether and how to voice an apology—is thematically clear but only lightly pressured on the page. The main “reversal” (breeze scattering the condensation words) is external and instantly rescued by spirits, so it doesn’t force a new tactic or deepen her dilemma. Her mission “to find the moment before deciding” never quite hardens into a choice with visible cost; she essentially performs the ritual and is relieved. As a result, escalation feels more like a widening of imagery than an intensifying conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—whether trauma can be transformed into something sustaining—is compelling in concept but under-pressured in execution. There is no real opposition: the notes become legible almost magically, the coral readily absorbs fear, and the ritual proceeds without setback or doubt. The only “tightening” is the deepening anesthetic and the notes glowing, which shifts tone but not options. As a result, the piece feels moving yet essentially conflict-light, closer to a lyrical vignette than a fully stressed scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict and stakes are the weakest axis: the artist’s desire to restore joy meets no real resistance, and every step (learning, painting, reception) proceeds smoothly. There is no antagonist, setback, or difficult trade-off, and her agency is never seriously tested. The dominant stake (can art re-enliven the orchard’s souls?) is declared but never put at risk. This yields a pleasant vignette rather than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s willingness to surrender certainty for curiosity—is present but stays largely conceptual. There is some escalation through increasingly intense sensations and visions of past restorations, but nothing concretely threatens her or forces a difficult trade-off. Her agency at the end (keeping the coin, walking away with a new stance) feels more like accepting an offered gift than paying a price, so pressure never tightens beyond a gentle internal nudge. As a result, the piece reads as a lyrical vignette rather than a scene with meaningful conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central stake—keeping thought free in a regime that taxes it—is powerful but remains mostly abstract; no specific law, enforcer, or imminent risk appears on the page. Lysander’s tactics (joining gardens, planting patterns) don’t encounter concrete resistance or trade-offs, so his rebellion feels curiously unpressured. The main “tightening” is the greenhouse’s warping moment and Mirabel’s entry, but her decision to protect the garden isn’t contested by any on-page counterforce. As a result, conflict exists as premise rather than as escalating, costed scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the poet can transform accumulated sorrow into healing beauty—remains largely abstract and unopposed. Pressure rises a little with the discovery and eventual blooming of the postcard’s nebulae, but there is no concrete dilemma, loss, or sacrifice staged on the page; his mission proceeds without real resistance. Escalation is more a steady thickening of imagery than a narrowing of options or heightening of cost. As a result, the armistice feels graceful rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether lost feelings and names can be preserved against erasure—is mostly treated as a given rather than tested. The main “turn” is the traveler’s arrival, which validates her work but doesn’t force a new, higher-stakes decision or tradeoff. Her agency operates through steady repetition, not through a pressured choice that forecloses a path; there’s minimal escalation beyond deepening the ritual’s description. As a result, tension is low and stakes feel abstract rather than viscerally tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reopening a broken dialogue and restoring trust—is articulated, and decoding the glyphs is a goal-driven process. The main tightening occurs when the third glyph releases the lost covenant, reweighting her work from technical to sacred. Still, conflict remains largely frictionless: no real antagonistic force, no serious setback, and the “time pressed, before paths diverge” clock never materially changes her tactics or extracts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stake—reconciling preservation and progress—is strong, but on the page conflict is nearly frictionless: Mira’s plan works on the first try and no one actively opposes her. The only “tightening” is the amphitheater’s tremor resolving into calm once she turns the valve, which reads more as confirmation than escalation. The council’s division is summarized rather than dramatized, and the elder’s conversion comes without any visible cost or real debate. As a result, tension feels low and the resolution under-tested, even within a gentle, accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lila can transmute her loss into a new, trusting relationship with the world—is clear, but the on-page pressure on that stake remains very gentle. There are no real reversals or obstacles: once she finds the meteorite chip, every experiment (mapping dust, attaching slivers to pigeons, sending notes) succeeds without friction, and her trust seems to increase in a smooth line. As a result, escalation reads more like steady enrichment of a mood than a testing of resolve or a narrowing of options. The final stance feels earned enough for a quiet piece but lacks the sharpened trade-off a top-tier venue would usually demand.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is internal and thematic—understanding thresholds, grief, and his role in the maze—signaled early and clarified by the end. There is some escalation as he discovers the hidden panel and descends to the maps, but opposition is almost entirely absent; nothing resists him. As a result, his “triumph” feels contemplative rather than hard-won, with no concrete risk or sacrifice depicted on the page. This keeps the pressure from tightening into truly consequential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake is Aria’s desire to access and understand the city’s “rhythm of belonging,” but it remains abstract and unopposed; nothing meaningful resists her beyond the initial obscurity of the corridors. The main “tightening” is her descent into the chamber and the activation of the instruments, which deepens connection but doesn’t narrow options or force trade-offs. The “until sunrise” frame and the implied spirits never sharpen into real pressure or threat. As a result, the conflict reads as a smooth, untested initiation rather than an escalating crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recover the disappearing paths/bridge—is present from early on and nominally urgent. However, conflict is mostly procedural discovery with no real setback, resistance, or alternative cost-bearing choice; each new seed simply yields another helpful clue. The climactic act (placing the final seed in the fissure) is frictionless and succeeds on the first attempt, with no visible price beyond a generalized bittersweetness. As a result, escalation registers as deepening texture rather than genuine tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—will his orchestrated randomness yield a moment of “magic” shared with the audience—is conceptually present but never truly pressured. The sequence of acts feels smooth and unthreatened; the audience is receptive, and he never risks failure, rejection, or self-doubt. The only escalation is textural, as the ritual becomes more elaborate until the song, and then gentle denouement. Without a moment where something might meaningfully be lost, the conflict remains low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can successfully inscribe the cosmic verse and what that means for her exile—is clear but only lightly pressurized. She discovers the speck without difficulty, learns to slip through gaps in a summary-like way, and the climactic ritual proceeds smoothly; there’s no meaningful on-page test, setback, or trade-off. The “cost” is almost entirely conceptual (reframing exile), and we don’t feel her risking anything tangible or emotionally dangerous in the moment. As a result, escalation is more decorative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to reaffirm the value of the mundane—is more declared than pressured; nothing on the page genuinely threatens that belief. Her “unsettled thoughts” are never concretized into a dilemma or viable alternative stance, and no external force complicates or resists her ritual. The internal conflict is thus largely static contemplation that gently resolves, rather than a stance tested by resistance or loss. As a result, escalation is minimal and the ending, while pretty, feels inevitable from the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are largely internal and thematic—what to do with the “bargain of innocence” and how to repurpose pain—but they are not subjected to much on-page resistance. Maren never confronts a real possibility of refusing, failing, or misusing the box; everything proceeds smoothly from intention to fulfillment. The past cost (her bargain to save the hikers) is gestured at but not revisited in a way that creates fresh pressure in the present scene. As a result, escalation is more a gentle deepening of imagery than a narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing communal hope via understanding the gauge—is stated but never feels truly precarious, as there’s no concrete threat if Arin fails beyond a general malaise. Conflict is essentially absent: the council is “unsettled” but quickly “quietly exhilarated,” and no character or circumstance meaningfully opposes Arin’s plan. Escalation reads as more balloons, more data, more color, without a significant tightening or trade-off. The resolution is earned in a logical sense, but arrives without a hard choice, sacrifice, or narrowed option set.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can meaningfully access and honor the walls’ dreams—remains mostly internal and low-pressure. There is a gentle deepening when the wall “exhales” and when the legacy shifts from solitary burden to shared communion, but little is genuinely at risk; no option is sharply foreclosed. Conflict is largely absent: nothing resists her, and her goal is never seriously threatened. As a result, escalation is more tonal than substantive, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no conflict: the painter’s goal is stated and then smoothly achieved without genuine threat, resistance, or sacrifice. The “hush before the bells” suggests a ticking clock but never meaningfully tightens his options or forces trade-offs. No reversal or escalation tests his commitment; the mirrors flicker, then comply. The piece functions as a spell being performed, not a problem being struggled through, which keeps stakes low.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can she transform a ritual into real peace in a “forever war”?—is clear, and there is a single tightening as she begins reading the clauses and waits for the chieftains’ reactions. However, opposition is very soft: the first chieftain’s armor “clanged like a storm,” but he yields almost immediately, and others follow without visible resistance. The story asserts that the price of redemption is high but doesn’t dramatize serious pushback, doubt, or potential failure on the page, so escalation feels modest. The resolution, while emotionally satisfying, doesn’t extract a sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he will preserve the echo of the extinct bird in the very landscape he ruined—is clear, but pressure barely escalates. There’s no resistance (external or internal) to his plan once he’s on the salt flat; the timing with thunder is framed as technical choreography, not a live risk. His amorality versus sentimentality is thematically suggested yet not rigorously tested in a way that forces a trade-off or visible cost in-scene. As a result, the ritual feels more like an inevitable execution than a contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—shattering conformity’s lullaby via the sanctuary—is articulated and followed through, and there is a clear escalation from private experiment to citywide change. Yet conflict remains largely unopposed: the threads offer no resistance, there is no failure, counterpressure, or risk of loss once she begins untangling. As a result, tension stays conceptual and low-friction even at the climax when the sanctuary erupts in light. Without a felt price or threatened cost, the rebellion’s victory reads as too easily won for the ambitions of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely resolved before the story opens; the tavern argument is off-stage and has already melted into a “meteor hush.” On the page, Selene’s desire to explore ethical storytelling never meets serious resistance—no counter-impulse, material obstacle, or real risk to her status or self-concept is dramatized. The main “escalation” is the ember brightening to reveal a conceptual twist about puppet strings, which is arresting but not hard-won. As a result, stakes feel abstract and tension stays low, limiting the story’s dramatic grip.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are largely implicit and internal: the risk that these unnoticed histories remain unmarked versus the fragile attempt at remembrance. The primary pressure is temporal—the passage of the last monarch and the imminent dissolution of the structures—but Lira’s commitment is never in doubt, so escalation is gentle rather than tense. Her key “choice” to stay and tie the final knot is an extension of an already-set path, not a pressured pivot. As a result, the piece is moving but dramatically low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual (whether names and memories remain frozen or are restored), and they’re signaled clearly but never truly jeopardized. Mara faces no on-page obstacle—internal or external—that threatens failure once she commits, so pressure doesn’t noticeably tighten between beginning and end. The traveler’s arrival adds scale, not conflict, so escalation reads as accumulation of wonder rather than a deepening test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—uncovering why paths choose walkers and what happens to the directive—but on-page pressure remains low. The storm, the directive’s decay, and the ritual never really threaten failure or real loss; the outcome feels more like an inevitable unveiling than something earned under stress. There is a clear escalation in image scale (from bunker to vortex to forest-wide rewriting), yet no major option is foreclosed or trade-off dramatized. As a result, conflict feels gentle and largely frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant that might bless his people—is clearly stated but never meaningfully pressured; once named, it proceeds unimpeded to success. There is no concrete opposition (ritual risk, moral cost, political danger, or internal hesitation) to force a trade-off or narrowing of options. Escalation is more a steady accumulation of descriptive reverence than a tightening of conflict. As a result, the climactic ritual reads as a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether deeply resentful figures can have their emotional wiring changed—is clear, and Mara’s scheme gives the story an initial tension. That pressure never fully tightens: Kovan and the other monks yield quickly to the box’s vibration, and the wanderer’s transformation is immediate, with no serious resistance or risk of failure. As a result, there’s little sense of cost, trade-off, or hard choice; once the box is in place, the outcome feels guaranteed. The conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as live jeopardy in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recapturing and anchoring a fugitive hope—is clear, and the ritual deepening around the synchronized breathing provides a gentle sense of tightening. However, resistance remains soft: the dream appears and is taken into the mirror without a serious risk of failure or a clear trade-off. Arlen’s agency is present but never tested against a real possibility of loss, which keeps the escalation from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can restore the lenses and reorient her purpose after the breach—is present but gentle. The ribbon snag introduces a small but effective moment of pressure that sparks the central tactic, yet afterward the mending proceeds with almost no resistance or complication. There is limited escalation: once the idea arrives, success feels assured and carries little uncertainty or sacrifice. As a result, the emotional and narrative pressure never tightens enough to feel truly high-stakes, even at this short length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—gaining forbidden, nonlinear knowledge at the potential price of his linear identity—is clear but never bites hard on the page. Conflict is largely internal and philosophical, without a strong sense of risk or a meaningful option he might refuse; he moves fairly smoothly from confusion to comprehension. The main tightening is the revelation that using the key requires surrendering linear narrative, but this is accepted without struggle. As a result, escalation feels conceptual rather than pressurized, with low felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the “library of unlearned lessons” to alter a future—is clear but remains largely abstract, and the obstacles yield as soon as Selene applies the correct knowledge. There is some escalation (voids singing, floor giving way, a locked door in unknown dialect, then a second renegotiation to reveal the portal), yet each challenge is resolved quickly and cleanly without meaningful reversals or visible loss. The time traveler’s presence does not add real pressure or time constraint, functioning more as confirmation than as tension. As a result, the story reads as a beautifully imagined discovery sequence rather than a genuinely testing conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering scattered verses to unlock the garden and free forgotten names—is clear, but the conflict is remarkably frictionless. Each action (slotting the card, diving into ink, catching verses, entering the garden) proceeds without resistance, reversal, or visible trade-off, so pressure never truly tightens. The final mission vow reweights meaning but not stakes; escalation reads as steady accumulation of wonders rather than tested commitment with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—resolving the paradoxical door to achieve clarity—is clear but remains largely conceptual and unthreatening. Escalation is mostly a smooth sequence of ritual steps, with no real reversals, obstacles, or trade-offs; Mara never seriously risks failure or harm. The one tightening beat is the shimmering seam and opening of the vault, but the subsequent reweaving proceeds frictionlessly. The frozen clock and vanished door imply cost but that price is not dramatized as a hard choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring quiet to the caves—is clear from early on, and the tension between the storm of resonance and the desired hush is conceptually strong. However, the conflict feels largely one-sided: the energy beings never resist, the mapping process proceeds without hitch, and the stone works exactly as hoped on first deployment. The “pressure” comes more from ambient disturbance than from escalating obstacles or trade-offs forced on the protagonist. As a result, the resolution feels serene rather than earned under strain, which keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to prove that coincidental alignments have meaning—is declared, but on-page pressure remains low. The rekindling sequence lacks friction or real risk; the ritual works on the first described attempt, and no meaningful alternative or failure path is dramatized. Subsequent developments (travelers arriving, the network revelation, the broadened vow) feel like expansions of scope rather than escalations that force difficult trade-offs. As a result, tension is gentle and atmospheric rather than urgent, and costs are implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can map collective memory and shape identity from it—remains mostly conceptual, with little opposing force beyond abstraction. Escalation is primarily atmospheric (storm → solid fog → sunrise) and contemplative; the shadow experiment is interesting but not a real risk or trade-off. His eventual resolve doesn’t foreclose a substantial path; no major option is lost or morally fraught. The result is textured but low-tension conflict that suits the lyric mode yet limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can kindle hope in a starless, hopeless night—is clear but remains largely abstract. Pressure does increase slightly when he lifts and lights the knot, then when the sparks “complete” the mosaic note, but there is no real sense of what failure would mean in this moment beyond continued mood. His agency is steady rather than tested; he never wavers or faces a true trade-off. The result is a gentle arc of fulfillment rather than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the difficult conversation will move from pride toward softening—is clear but remains abstract and low-pressure on the page. Escalation is minimal: the night “trembling stillness” and vibrating cicada suggest impending tension, yet the chieftain’s heavy words and the pause yield almost immediately to a gentle thaw with no real threat of rupture. The chronicler’s agency doesn’t visibly alter the leaders’ options; she observes rather than intervenes or risks anything. As a result, the story has atmosphere but limited felt stakes or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio can face the open, inverted world to collect and preserve silences—is present, and the one-hour inversion window offers a structural pressure. However, escalation is mostly implied rather than dramatized: the climb, collection, and descent face no real obstacle or reversal. The price (risk of floating stone, emotional stretch against claustrophobia) stays largely conceptual, so the tension never quite tightens into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain very low and largely abstract: Lira wants to soothe travelers, and nothing on the page resists her beyond ambient “creaks” and implied agitation. There is no meaningful escalation—noise never spikes, the vial never threatens harm, and the passengers never oppose her—so the outcome feels foregone. The vial bursting into silver is framed as a culmination, not a crisis; it produces more beauty than pressure. Without at least one concrete test of her methods or a risk of failure, the narrative reads as a mood-piece rather than a story with real tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the stairway and throne before sunrise—is clearly announced but faces almost no resistance. Mina follows a sequence of glowing guides and singing corridors; nothing truly tests her resolve or forces a tradeoff. The time pressure never alters her tactics, and there is no antagonistic force (internal or external) tightening around her ascent. As a result, escalation is more procedural than tense, and the final acceptance of the throne arrives without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the keeper can transform suffocating darkness into something that breathes, at the cost of his own retreat—is clear but stays mostly conceptual. There is some escalation as he approaches the threshold, burns bridges behind him, and finally steps through with no way back. However, the pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten on the page; failure never feels like a live possibility, and the choice reads as preordained ritual rather than a contested decision. The result is a steady, atmospheric arc rather than a truly sharpening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—whether to trust this new promise given past exploitation—is clear, and the glitch texts plus Lira’s urging create believable pressure on that decision. Escalation is present when the bolt is placed, the pressure rises, and the mushrooms pulse in rhythm, but the risk of saying yes remains almost entirely psychological or symbolic. Once the choice is made, events proceed without complication or reversal; there’s no moment where the cost of a wrong move feels potentially damaging in concrete terms. The result is satisfying but a bit low-tension for top-tier conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the buried truth about the dynasty—is stated clearly, but opposition is minimal and almost entirely internal. Once he cranks the gramophone, each subsequent step proceeds smoothly, with no genuine threat of failure or alternative path tested. There is a mild escalation from listening, to decoding, to opening the compartment, to reading the confession, but no real tightening of options or visible trade-off. The resolution feels earned but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the knight remains a solitary, withdrawn figure or offers allegiance to performance and possibility—is present but under-pressured. There is little opposition, internal or external: the control panel yields after brief, almost frictionless effort; the script’s release and the knight’s merging with the orchard feel granted rather than contested. Escalation is more a steady thickening of imagery than a narrowing of options with visible trade-offs. The cost of merging (loss of self, risk, sacrifice) is implied but not dramatized as a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict and stakes remain very gentle: Amelia wants to honor forgotten lives and essentially encounters no opposition beyond ambient neglect. The supervisor’s ready agreement softens what could have been a genuine test of her conviction or courage. Escalation is more a deepening of a lyrical pattern than a tightening of pressure, with little real cost or threatened loss. The result is emotionally pleasant but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—broadcasting a subversive truth against an indifferent regime—is clear, but on-the-page opposition is almost nonexistent; the transmitter accepts the key and functions without resistance. Claimed pressure (“when plans unravel”) doesn’t manifest as a real reversal or constraint, and we never see a concrete risk of failure or consequence if she’s caught. The escalation is more conceptual and atmospheric than practical: discovery → activation → diffusion through the populace. As a result, tension feels modest for the scale of change invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing a prophesied storm of fire—is clearly stated but remains abstract; nothing on the page tests or threatens failure once he begins playing. His main “choice” is whisper versus roar, which is conceptually interesting but not dramatized as a difficult or risky decision. There is little escalation beyond intensifying description: the code unravels smoothly, and success feels assured from early on. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than gripping, with limited sense of trade-off or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the forest’s messages to fulfill a renewal prophecy—is declared but never seriously threatened; every step works on the first try. Escalation is limited to deepening revelation (finding “home,” then water, then sanctuary) rather than tightening pressure or forcing trade-offs. The key “turns” (dust ignition, discovery of the spring, sealing the pact) arrive as benign rewards, not tests. As a result, tension remains low and the ending, while pretty, doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara clings to safe, fixed plans or surrenders to improvisational uncertainty—is clear, and her choice at the brazier and workshop does resolve it. However, the story offers almost no opposition: the compass works smoothly, the path opens, and no real danger or trade-off tests her commitment. The escalation is mostly a scenic deepening (tunnels → waterfall → brazier) rather than tightening pressure with visible costs. As a result, the conflict feels gentle and contemplative rather than truly driven.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the coin and, by extension, her own fragmented self-knowledge—is present but stays abstract and low-pressure. There is one clear tightening when she whispers the dragon’s name and the metal responds, but failure carries no specified cost beyond continued regret. The piece tells us she must “push… beyond what any textbook declared possible,” yet we never see the limits push back or threaten her materially or morally. As a result, tension is more meditative than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can transform sorrowful echoes into something healed or hopeful—is clear but remains mostly abstract. Conflict is almost entirely one-sided; the spirits do not resist, and once she recalls the joke, success follows without complication or visible risk. There is a modest tightening when she identifies laughter as the “missing ingredient” and chooses to act, but no real trade-off or cost is dramatized. As a result, pressure exists conceptually but never truly bites, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Lira will endure further pain to achieve a merciful framework for others—is clear and internally coherent. Escalation is present but gentle: each flash of ultraviolet penance costs her, culminating in a “final surge of light” that precedes her release. The conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, so tension reads more as spiritual pressure than suspense. This suits the piece’s aims but keeps it from feeling sharply tested at a truly crucible-like level.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the lighthouse’s memory to honor forgotten histories—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the paintings’ patterns converge and the chain unfastens. Yet there is almost no resistance, risk, or trade-off; success feels inevitable once the task is named. Internal stakes (who the narrator is in relation to memory and tradition) matter, but they are not strongly pressured by alternative desires or fears. As a result, escalation remains mostly tonal rather than genuinely narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to uncover what the ceiling hides and honor the ghosts—is clear but under-pressured. There is a mild climb in tension (darkness, creaking ladder, widening cracks, ghostly presence) and one meaningful deepening when the barrel powers a map to the alcove. Yet there is no real risk of failure, moral dilemma, or visible cost to her choices; success seems inevitable once she commits. As a result, escalation feels more procedural than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.5)
    The declared stakes—this object can destabilize a “once perfect” system—promise real danger, but on the page there is little sustained pressure or resistance. Mara decides to use the catalyst and everything essentially works; the rupture is disruptive but immediately revealed as wondrous and beneficial, so tension never truly tightens. There’s no live alternative path or serious trade-off dramatized at the key beats, just successive escalations of spectacle. The result is a beautiful concept with low felt conflict and minimal visible price for Mara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—the community’s clashing origin myths and the possibility of a shared cultural rebirth—is conceptually strong and well signaled. Yet the conflict never bites very hard: the “archaeological dispute” is summarized, the elders’ opposition dissolves quickly under the aesthetic experience, and Lira is not forced into a visible sacrifice or risky choice on the page. The escalation is more a steady unveiling of spectacle than a tightening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—calming the chamber’s sorrowful note before it drowns the village—is clearly stated, and there is a nominal time pressure with midnight “stealing” the light. However, once Alder begins, his path is almost frictionless: no failed attempts, no ethical tradeoff, and no serious risk that he might err. The tightening is mostly tonal (midnight approaching) rather than a true narrowing of options or escalation of cost. As a result, the conflict feels gentle and resolved without being heavily tested.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—reaching and understanding the place “where explanations fail”—remains mostly abstract and faces little overt resistance. Once Mara commits to the journey, the environment consistently yields to her: the compass cooperates, the lagoon supports her, the staircase forms, and the crystal responds, with no meaningful obstacle or trade-off. As a result, escalation feels like a sequence of wonders rather than mounting pressure, and no option is visibly foreclosed. The quiet, lyric mode is fine, but a single sharp moment of risk, doubt, or potential loss would greatly deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely internal and low-intensity; there is no clear opposition, only a gentle question of how Mira will frame her art and learning. The main “turn” is her choice to treat the arch as portal and to build a layered tableau/compass sculpture, which is aesthetically meaningful but not strongly pressured. The storm and failed GPS gesture at external stakes but never truly complicate her options. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady deepening of mood than a tightening of pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to understand night-blooming flowers and her own “lingering winter”—is clearly signaled but faces almost no resistance. She decides to go, arrives, uses the postcard, and the window responds without real test or risk, so pressure barely tightens. Internal conflict (attachment to doubt vs. surrender to the vision) is asserted rather than dramatized through hard choices. The ending stance is aesthetically pleasing but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating erased histories—is clear and thematically potent, and there is one meaningful tightening when Mara must secure the sand‑carvers’ cooperation. Yet opposition stays soft: the parley succeeds without serious resistance, the symbols work on first attempt, and the lagoon yields its crystal without setback. As a result, escalation feels more like a guided ritual than a pressured struggle, with little sense of trade-off or risk to Mara beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the town can be revived without resorting to false, wish-based comfort—is present but remains abstract. Pressure nominally escalates as he moves from conceiving the plan to opening the bottle to reconstructing the town, yet each step succeeds without serious resistance or trade-off. The stated temptation of “easy magic” is never put to an on-page test, so there’s no sharp beat where a real option is foreclosed. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how Harel will understand and respond to the accidental prophecy—is present but under-pressured. The key tightening is his realization that the prophecy maps emotional currents and implicates his own work in a generational loop, but this doesn’t force a hard choice or visible sacrifice. There’s no tested alternative (conceal vs reveal, resist vs comply), so tension remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening meditation than conflict-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Mira accepting the covenant and inheriting the vortex/time-guard role—is clear but not strongly pressured. The ritual proceeds without resistance, reversal, or credible risk; no alternative path is meaningfully dramatized, and her choice feels foregone rather than contested. Escalation is primarily in imagery and scale (vortex intensifying, atrium transforming) rather than in narrowing options or sharpening costs. As a result, the piece is atmospheric and satisfying on a conceptual level but light on genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully converting the bell from mechanical clamor to microclimate-triggered listening—is clear, but the story offers almost no genuine resistance to that goal. Waiting for the glue to dry is framed as the main tension, and everything proceeds as planned with no misread, malfunction, or social pushback. As a result, there is limited escalation and little visible cost; the “experiment” never feels fragile or endangered. The quietness is intentional, but for elite literary publication, the conflict remains too static.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely pre-resolved: the janitor already honors the stars and continues to do so, with no opposition beyond existential loneliness and the “world’s clamor” outside. There is a modest tightening when he makes a vow, the earth responds, and he interprets it as confirmation, but no real option is foreclosed or tested. Stakes remain abstract (how fully he can empathize, how he frames stillness) rather than pressured by concrete loss, risk, or dilemma. The piece functions more as a meditative tableau than as a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the covenant of silence will be honored or broken—is present but never feels truly pressured; there’s no serious temptation or external force urging him to speak. Escalation comes mostly through new information (understanding the pact between man, bee, and spirit) rather than an intensifying clash of wants. His final choice is conceptually meaningful but emotionally under-contested, so tension remains low-key throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story declares a ticking-clock stake (“before the last grain of sand slipped through the hourglass of the valley”) and Mara’s existential hunger for time’s texture, but practical opposition is minimal. Once she recalls the garage-sale method, every step succeeds on the first try; there are no genuine setbacks, tradeoffs, or tested commitments. Escalation is thus mostly informational and atmospheric rather than pressure-driven. The ending reweights the situation but without a discernible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central “conflict” is the discord between wind and water, yet this tension never feels truly risky or resistant; the lagoon reliably responds to his gentle interventions. Stakes remain abstract—spiritual harmony and aesthetic completeness—without a clear consequence if he fails. The repeated kite-string snaps hint at fracture but don’t materially change options or tactics. As a result, there is little genuine escalation, and the resolution seems assured from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nominal stakes—a six-month limit and whether Mara’s work can outlast it—are strong, but on the page they never truly bite: Mara never seems in danger of failing, nor does anyone seriously oppose her. Conflict is largely atmospheric rather than enacted; visitors and children fall into harmony quickly, and the council reverses its decree without a visible struggle. There is an escalation in scale (from private experiment to pilgrimage site to policy change), yet it reads more like a smooth glide than pressured tightening. The cost of success—personal or communal—is barely registered.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether humanity responds to first contact with inquiry or awe—is implied but never framed in concrete risks for Arin on the page. Escalation is present in a textural sense (signal arrival → experiment → resonance), yet there is no real narrowing of options, opposing force, or visible price for his choices; the alien pulse simply harmonizes with the amber without resistance. His agency initiates the convergence, but it doesn’t force a difficult trade-off or foreclose a path. As a result, tension stays low and the climax reads as a beautiful synchronization rather than a pressured decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the coachman can midwife renewal on a wounded battlefield—is present but faces minimal friction. Birds cooperate, magic works on the first attempt, and no real counterforce (natural, human, or internal) tests his commitment. Escalation is modest: the main deepening is moving from intention to visible sprouts and then to ancestral approval. As a result, the piece feels like a beautiful ritual more than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Rook will embrace a new, connective purpose instead of passive retirement—is clear, but it faces little real opposition. Discovering and decoding the cylinder and retrieving the leaf all proceed without setback or meaningful risk, so escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling than a tightening. The key “choice” to reseal the leaf and carry the voices is interesting but not sharply pitted against a tempting alternative. As a result, tension is more meditative than urgent, which limits conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s need to find direction/meaning after a shutdown-era loss, but pressure remains low and largely internal. The key tightening is the first vision on the deck, which reweights their relationship to ritual and “true north.” However, there’s no strong sense of alternative options or real risk in choosing exploration; no path is convincingly foreclosed. The second anniversary scene reinforces rather than tests the narrator’s stance, so escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—lifting the curse and restoring ancient knowledge—is stated and followed through, but on-page conflict is almost entirely procedural and unopposed. Each swap works as intended; the ice “seems to soften,” and there is no genuine risk of failure, moral tension, or sacrifice that narrows his options. As a result, escalation is more a steady accumulation of beautiful beats than a tightening of pressure, leaving the climax more ornamental than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resisting oblivion by preserving erased gestures—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively gentle and unopposed. Once Mira chooses her method (patterned walking), the gallery and chessboard yield to her quite readily; there’s minimal cost or real risk dramatized. The main “tightening” is the discovery of the scroll and her acceptance of responsibility, which deepens commitment but doesn’t foreclose many tangible options. The piece reads more as a lyrical rite than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can reclaim a sense of home and activate her buried talents—is clear, and there is some deepening when memory becomes painful and the courtyard image “shattered like glass.” However, escalation is gentle; external resistance is absent, and internal resistance is quickly passed through rather than dramatized as a live contest. Once the secret corridor appears, everything unfolds with minimal friction, so the sense of risk or potential loss is muted. The resolution feels more like graceful completion than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can he shed the guilt of a catastrophic mistake—is clear from early on and threads through the piece. However, the pressure curve is soft: he decodes the threads, walks the corridors, recalls errors, and then chooses to let go without encountering a substantial setback, competing value, or real risk of failure. Internal conflict between his need for punishment and desire for peace is gestured at (“fierce repose”) but never truly sharpens into a dilemma with on-page cost. As a result, escalation feels more like continuous contemplation than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—earning forgiveness for the canyon’s ancient wounds via art—is clear, and there is some escalation as the solitary mischief widens into a communal chorus and the canyon holds its breath before responding. However, opposition and risk are mostly implied; nothing threatens Mara’s attempt, and the “price” is accepted without on-page resistance or genuine risk of failure. The ritual being “imminent” adds a soft clock but doesn’t noticeably constrain tactics or force a hard trade-off. The emotional deepening works, but pressure never quite tightens into a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant conflict—her struggle to turn uncertainty into purposeful repair—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when she aligns the charm with the deepest fissure and begins her tale. However, resistance is minimal: once she starts narrating, each step proceeds without real setback or doubt resurgence, so stakes feel more declared (“edge of oblivion”) than viscerally tested. The external world (acid sea, dissolving foundations) threatens but never forces hard choices or sacrifices on the page. The result is textured but relatively low-pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can locate and preserve a “temporary eternity” for himself—is clear but under-pressured on the page. The discovery of the oasis and the key unfold with almost no resistance or genuine jeopardy, and the “test” of aloofness never forces him into a visible trade-off or moment of serious doubt. Escalation exists mainly as deepening atmosphere and symbolic revelation rather than narrowing options or raising costs. This keeps the piece more like a contemplative fable than a story with palpable tension, which is a legitimate choice but limits stakes-driven impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether gentle, purified intent can truly reach and guide another—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and rarely opposed. Once Mara decides to perform the ritual, nothing resists her; the fisherman responds with minimal friction, and success arrives on the first try. Escalation is more tonal than structural, relying on intensifying imagery rather than new obstacles or narrowing options. As a result, the climax feels more like confirmation of a belief than a hard-won or risky turn.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming loss into a map that can guide people back—is clear, but the on-page pressure on that goal is low. We’re told about repetition (“Night after night”) rather than seeing a specific setback, dilemma, or test that forces a sharper choice. The closest to escalation is the censer absorbing sorrow and the engine’s changing pulse, but these are described as inevitabilities rather than contested turns. As a result, the ending is moving but feels more like the natural culmination of a ritual than the outcome of escalated conflict with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—how the glass eye will be used: for exploitative smuggling or communal honesty—is clear, and Mara’s choice to hide and reframe it provides one meaningful tightening. Internal and external conflicts are interwoven conceptually (truth, secrecy, shared pain). Yet the antagonistic pressure is underdeveloped: the smugglers barely press back, there’s no real risk to Mara beyond implication, and their quick submission drains tension from the climax. As a result, stakes feel more declared than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Marlowe can meaningfully interpret and preserve the stranger’s final gesture—is clear but low-intensity. There is one main tightening when he realizes the tide’s pauses are “the stranger’s borrowed memories, stitched into the tide’s cadence,” which deepens the emotional weight of his decision to place the flower and light the lamp. However, there is little real friction or counterpressure: no palpable risk to failing, no competing desire, and no visible price beyond a subtle shift in his solitude. The piece reads as contemplative more than truly embattled, which limits conflict-driven force.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elian will honor the promise and what that means for his life—is present but never feels genuinely pressured. Events unfold smoothly, with minimal resistance or cost; the “doorway of decisions” appears and is accepted without any substantial dilemma or reversal. The choice to return to the shop rather than step through a specific horizon is conceptually rich but skims past the emotional or practical trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like an elegant reveal than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (solve the recurring dreams / relieve the kingdom’s unrest) is announced, but the on-page conflict is largely unopposed: the grotto cooperates, the map appears, the orb yields its secret on first contact. There’s one meaningful tightening—entering the alcove and committing to touching the orb—but it lacks a palpable alternative or trade-off. No external antagonist or internal dilemma escalates beyond the initial choice to go; tension becomes a steady hum of wonder rather than a rising curve of pressure. As a result, the climax feels too easy for the scale of the implied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the “density of presence” to guide travelers—is clear but remains entirely aspirational and untested. Once the ritual begins, nothing meaningfully resists them; every step works as intended, so pressure never tightens. The only “turn” is success itself, which feels foregone rather than earned through risky decisions. As a result, the ending is more a graceful completion of a plan than a resolution forged under escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will be paralyzed by mortality and nostalgia or continue to transmute them into lucid narrative and flight—is clear but stays largely conceptual. Pressure escalates gently via the vision of his own grave, the intense dream of soaring and watching his younger self, and the post-waking struggle to order the “tangled rope” of memory. The closing choice to reinterpret the grave and step outside provides resolution, but the path there lacks a sharply felt on-page cost or a decisive internal struggle moment. Tension thus reads as steady yearning rather than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s need to animate the clamp screw and, through it, reaffirm her capacity to sense miracles without smell—is clear but gently pressed. There is a mild escalation as she aligns the screw to the pendulum, the clock responds, the fog thins, and the outside mother appears, yet no true option is foreclosed and no hard choice is forced. Conflict is largely atmospheric and internal, with little explicit resistance or friction beyond the implied loss of smell and the inertness of metal. The ending feels earned in tone but not strongly contested in terms of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—releasing the burden of her scars—is signaled early and followed through, but pressure remains gentle and almost entirely internal. The main “tightening” is the moment when the shards flare and coalesce into light, yet there’s no real threat of loss or failure pushing against her desire. Because each ritual step works as intended, the arc reads more like a meditative completion than a tested choice with cost. As a result, tension exists as low thrum rather than something that meaningfully narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully apologize/reconnect before the orchard is destroyed—is clear but remains fairly soft. There is one meaningful deepening when the induced currents animate the scores and the apology page manifests, and another when she must send it out into the wind before the final axe blow. However, tension never quite bites: she never seriously doubts, fails, or risks escalation beyond ritual effort, and no option is sharply foreclosed. As a result, pressure feels more like a steady thrum than a tightening vice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are announced at a cosmic scale, but on-page pressure stays low and unopposed. The “spiral arbitration” escalates in imagery rather than in genuine resistance, risk, or narrowing of options. Her urge to unify reality never meaningfully conflicts with fear, doubt, or another desire, so the ritual proceeds smoothly from start to finish. The ending’s cost (self-effacement, end of history) is conceptually large but not dramatized through hard choices or contested beats.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—his need to understand what clocks truly measure—remains largely internal and meditative, with minimal sense of risk if he fails. There is a structural tightening as he counts down to zero and the mechanism responds, but the pressure never truly escalates beyond a gentle suspense about the next insight. No options are sharply foreclosed; his “choice” is essentially to attend and then to accept a new framing. The conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically soft, which limits tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—securing the farm against intrusion/flood—is present but stays abstract and low-pressure for most of the piece. The introduction of the laser system and the storm both resolve smoothly, with no meaningful risk or price paid; solutions arrive as demonstrations rather than trials. Internal conflict (“physics of letting go”) never forces a hard choice against external stakes. As a result, escalation feels more like a sequence of proofs than a tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s quest to reconcile probability and chance in the wake of her mother’s death—is conceptually high, but on the page the pressure remains gentle. The tunnel sequence presents no real obstacles, reversals, or costly trade-offs; each scrawl translates smoothly into progress. Her internal conflict (responsible widening of perspectives vs. inherited compulsion) is gestured at but never forces a painful choice or renunciation. As a result, escalation is minimal and the final theorem feels like an expected endpoint rather than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara remains in cultivated estrangement or allows true contact—is clear, but the pressure on that stake never tightens dramatically. The Lena call is the main deepening of conflict, transforming the loop from abstract practice to carrying real sorrow, and the later unseen “Thank you” nudges Mara toward change. However, there is little sense of risk or competing impulses at the decisive moment; stepping out of the booth feels almost frictionless. The conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether memory/covenant can be actively renewed against the eroding tide of forgetfulness—is conceptually strong but only gently dramatized. Pressure does increase somewhat as twilight deepens, the tide turns, and the sea’s chant crescendos, yet nothing on the page seriously endangers his ability or willingness to perform the ritual. His main “choice” is to recommit and continue writing, which feels foregone rather than contested. The result is a beautiful mood piece with low overt conflict and limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (accessing the fragment to potentially cure loneliness) is clear, but the on-page obstacles are gentle: decipher the ivy pattern, cut, retrieve. There is little escalation beyond discovery to retrieval; once the caretaker names the condition, success feels assured and unthreatened. No meaningful alternative or costed trade-off emerges—Lira never risks failing, losing the fragment, or paying a personal price. The piece reads as a lyrical fulfillment more than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—reaching the stillpoint to map her emotional depths—is declared but never meaningfully threatened; once she enters the forest and tunes into the melody, nothing impedes her. Pressure “escalates” mainly via a crescendo in description (the melody intensifying, the ring glowing), not through narrowed options or risky trade-offs. The climax at the bark-knot is a fulfillment rather than a tested choice. This produces a gentle, almost inevitable progression instead of a charged escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    The nominal stakes—repairing a prior catastrophic error, stabilizing a volatile anomaly, and reclaiming a sense of competence—are high in concept. On the page, though, pressure remains gentle; once the narrator invokes the pen’s method, the conflict resolves without meaningful resistance, trade-off, or escalation. There is no real reversal or narrowing of options beyond deciding to act now, and no visible price is paid for the success. As a result, the story feels contemplative rather than tense, limiting its impact in a competitive literary context.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether silence can be transformed into soothing music for the forgotten—remains largely abstract and unopposed. Arlen encounters no resistance as he performs his ritual; Lira meets an accommodating harbor and makes an unpressured vow. There is minimal escalation beyond an increase in descriptive intensity as the harbor “glowed like a lantern.” As a result, the piece reads more as an atmospheric demonstration of a concept than as a conflict-driven scene with narrowing options or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stakes—whether he will meaningfully redeem himself by retrieving and then embodying the mentor’s promise—are present but remain largely conceptual. The external “puzzle” conflict (following the art trail, unlocking the niche) unfolds smoothly, with no genuine obstacles or reversals beyond discovery itself; it feels like a guided tour rather than a test. Internal and external stakes align at the end when he chooses to become a guardian of memory, but we don’t see him forced into a difficult trade-off or a visible loss. The escalation is more linear deepening than tightening pressure, which limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming sterile, exploitative treatment into a shared, compassionate rhythm—is present but remains largely abstract and unopposed. Escalation comes from Lira’s increasing drumming and the garden’s amplified responses, yet there is no real counterforce from the lab or internal conflict to force a difficult trade-off. The shift from “cold observation” to “compassionate collaboration” happens quickly and cleanly, without visible sacrifice, backlash, or even serious doubt from the researchers. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than genuinely pressurized, limiting the sense of cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that a whisper can travel farther than a shout—is clearly signaled, but remains more intellectual than urgent. Conflict is almost entirely situational and procedural; each tool (map, coin, key, radios) works with little resistance or failure, so pressure never truly tightens. There’s no opposing force or serious risk to Milo beyond mild uncertainty, and no decision that clearly forecloses a painful alternative. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the climax reads more as confirmation than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether darkness can be taught to recognize its own light—remains largely abstract and faces no real opposition. Pressure deepens texturally (patterns elaborate, shutters slow), but there’s no meaningful tightening that threatens failure or forces a trade-off. The guardian never appears at risk of not completing its mission; patience is stated rather than tested. As a result, tension is atmospheric but not truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.7)
    The central stake—whether Mara’s “humble rebellion” can shift a conformity-driven town—is clear but remains largely abstract and unresisted. Once the synchronized windows begin, the town’s adoption of her vision (citizens planting saplings, the mayor opening the forum) arrives with almost no pushback, trade-off, or visible sacrifice. There is an escalation in scale, but not in pressure; no path feels foreclosed or truly risky for Mara on the page. As a result, tension stays low and the ending, while thematically satisfying, lacks palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central stakes—Mara’s need to reconcile duty with freedom and to unlock a collective, non-violent future—are signaled and aligned with the island test. Yet the escalation is soft: once the island appears, each step (placing the scrimshaw, singing, accessing the tower, triggering the crystal) proceeds without resistance, risk, or genuine uncertainty. The whale’s late arrival is impressive but not threatening; it functions as benevolent deus ex machina. Without tangible jeopardy or trade-off, the conflict resolves cleanly rather than under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can create a lawful space for grief under the happiness mandate—is clear but remains largely abstract. Pressure does not significantly escalate; there’s no concrete threat of surveillance, punishment, or relational loss, only the idea of “breaking the law” hovering in the background. Her agency manifests in choosing to proceed and redefining her act as cultivation rather than rebellion, which offers a subtle internal turn. Still, the conflict never feels meaningfully tightened or tested beyond that reframe.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—liberating and redefining boundaries between sacred and free expression—is clear but remains almost entirely conceptual. There is no real resistance beyond atmosphere: the ban has already lifted, the colonnade “wants to hear,” and the old prohibitions fold without struggle once he speaks. Escalation is mostly a steady crescendo of imagery (color deepening, boundaries dissolving) rather than a tightening of pressure or a forced trade-off. As a result, the final crossing of the colonnade feels inevitable and untested, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Selene’s quest to reshape her relationship to her own flawed perception—is clear, but pressure on that stake is minimal. Each bartered awakening succeeds with little friction; there’s no strong moment where she risks losing the ability, her sight, or the courtyard’s magic. The “cost” of relinquishing the dream of perfection is more stated than fought for on the page, so escalation reads as a gentle intensification of wonder rather than a tightening of options. This keeps the piece contemplative but limits narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—using the ritual to grow an artificial mind’s sense of kinship—is clear, but pressure remains low and largely uncontested. The only external constraint is the earlier grid instability, which is already resolved when the story opens, so nothing on the page actively threatens failure. The main deepening is the artificial mind’s first “sigh” and returned chord, which reweights the ritual but doesn’t force a hard trade-off or loss. As a result, the piece has tonal and conceptual tension but little true escalation or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform her own withering spirit (and others’) into renewed bloom—is clear and threads the whole story. There is one main tightening when she traces the stencil onto the rose and waits to see if intention will work in the world beyond herself. However, resistance is minimal: the rose revives at first touch of intention, and subsequent gardens and visitors adopt her method without friction. The escalation is thus more contemplative than pressured, effective but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can she extract a hopeful pattern from ruin—is stated, but opposing pressure is largely abstract and never bites. Escalation is mild: the tape’s reactions and the humming walls deepen the ritual rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. Her “decision” to embrace purpose costs her little on the page, so tension never rises beyond a low, meditative hum. The piece functions more as an evocative vignette than as a scene under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high (soul purification, forbidden knowledge, reclaiming a lost heritage), but on the page the conflict is almost entirely frictionless. Once the method is recalled, the historian applies it without serious temptation to fail, no external obstruction, and no real alternative path tested. The “pressure” is more mystical mood than concrete narrowing of options; he never appears in danger of losing the knowledge or paying a visible, specific price. As a result, escalation under pressure feels muted and largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether fleeting shadows of human longing can be preserved as hope—is clear but remains largely conceptual, with limited friction or opposition. Pressure gently increases as he notices the recurring child silhouette and engages the stone, but nothing meaningfully resists him or forces a trade-off. His key “choice” is to trust the legend and enshrine the shadow in the stone and footage, which comes easily. As a result, tension is low and the emotional price of his decision stays soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing trust/self-balance in the wake of a con—is clear, but on-page pressure is very low. Escalation is more tonal than situational: she moves from shaken to steadied without any genuine threat of failure or competing demand that would force a painful trade-off. The decision to withhold and then return the tail tip is a moral choice, yet it never feels at risk or opposed. As a result, the conflict reads contemplative rather than tense, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—achieving a meaningful, legible “closure” with scars—is signaled early and followed through, but the path to it is low-friction: the moss cooperates, the coffee rings yield insight, the ritual works on the first attempt. Internal pressure exists as longing and curiosity rather than sharp conflict; there’s no moment where a real alternative or sacrifice is dramatized. The escalation is more a steady unveiling of pattern than a tightening of options with cost. As a result, the ending is resonant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—locating and transforming unused love via unsent goodbyes—is legible and tied to her actions throughout. There is a single main tightening when the hidden compartment and letters appear, reweighting the quest from search to transformation. However, resistance and risk feel low: each new step yields without real friction, and she never has to trade one meaningful option against another. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than dramatically pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped creativity—is clear, but pressure around it is soft: there’s fatigue and a hint of long struggle, yet no real sense of risk if he fails tonight. Escalation is mostly a volume increase (more stars, louder verses) rather than a meaningful tightening of options or a trade-off. The “rest” beat could have been a moment of doubt or renunciation but functions more as a brief pause in the same trajectory. As a result, the final release feels aesthetically satisfying but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether renewal can be coaxed from a dead world—is articulated, and the chant with the clock serves as the main tightening beat. However, there is almost no resistance or escalation: once he acts, everything works, with no meaningful risk, trade-off, or credible chance of failure. Internal conflict (his dreamlessness vs. longing) is underplayed and doesn’t visibly endanger his mission. As a result, tension feels low even as the outcome is large-scale.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure here is almost entirely internal and tonal, with the “stake” being whether he will access deeper layers of his own mind. The forest offers no real resistance; once he follows the hum, the gear and engine respond without complication or risk, and no alternative path or failure mode is ever felt. The escalation from walking to dream-travel to engine activation is a gentle deepening rather than a tightening that forces a real trade-off. As a result, the conflict framework is serviceable but very soft for elite fiction standards.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will claim her dormant courage by undertaking the journey—is signaled, but the path toward it lacks genuine tightening. The ferry’s “indirect routes” and the shy moon are atmospheric rather than concrete impediments, and Mira never appears at serious risk of turning back or failing the opening of the chest. The story’s main turn is internal recognition upon seeing the “map of the inner self,” yet this arrives without any prior failed attempts or meaningful trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels more like steady ritual completion than pressure sharpening choices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the fortress’s “safety” is worth the silence and cold—is clearly declared but only lightly dramatized. Conflict is mostly static: the guests are uneasy but not forced into a sharp choice under visible duress; their “decision” is more an acceptance framed in exposition. The main tightening is the discoloration’s shift and the synchronized pause in nerve regeneration, which provides a turn but not a hard trade-off. As a result, the cost of their stance feels more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unmask the pretender and restore the rightful line—is clear, and there is one main tightening when the titan touches the crown and the floor begins to sunder. Yet opposition is mostly systemic and magical; the pretender’s resistance is passive, and the titan never seems close to failing or forced into a meaningful trade-off. The collapse introduces danger but resolves quickly via spectral confession and guiding spirits, so the felt cost remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central stake—understanding disappearing marine paths—is clear but remains mostly intellectual; it never sharpens into a moment where someone must choose at a visible cost. The main escalation is informational: the atlas watermark and the coordinate reveal, both arriving smoothly rather than through a fraught attempt or sacrifice. There is minimal resistance or complication; the ocean “speaking” through data feels serenely granted. As a result, tension stays low and the revelation doesn’t quite read as pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.6)
    The primary stakes—whether she can reignite a dormant rebellion and find meaning in this ruin—are clear, and the hum’s growth plus the engines’ revival give a sense of rising intensity. However, there is little genuine resistance or risk; once she decides to ask the stone, everything unfolds in a smooth upward curve without real threat of failure or conflicting consequences. Her agency is present but insufficiently tested, so escalation feels more like a graceful swell than a tightening that forces trade-offs. The lack of a visible, on-page price limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to unseal a dangerous, destiny-bearing relic to reshape tradition—exists and is legible, and the memory sacrifice provides one concrete price. However, opposition is weak: the elder’s warning is offstage, no one resists in the moment, and the unsealing proceeds smoothly without setbacks or real risk that the calamity might be triggered. As a result, pressure escalates more by accumulation of wonders than by tightening of options or sharpened ethical trade-offs. The newborn’s power feels overwhelmingly positive, softening what could have been a more fraught climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she can coexist with her trauma without being consumed—is clear, but pressure remains relatively gentle and reflective. The photograph scene does deepen the conflict, as she confronts the erased wedding moment and chooses to “freeze the grief for a heartbeat,” but there’s no sharp escalation or test that genuinely threatens her fragile equilibrium. Her agency is present yet largely contemplative; the path forward feels chosen, but not wrestled from palpable resistance. This keeps the piece from feeling fully climactic on a conflict level.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can meaningfully redesign his way of “painting souls” in the face of his own brokenness—is consistent and escalates as the space seems to tighten and literally push him into the dark chamber. The turn into the stairwell and the door slamming behind him provide a clear deepening of pressure and a moment of no easy retreat. However, resistance and cost remain mostly symbolic; the cards’ self-rearrangement and his insight arrive without much friction or real risk, making the journey feel more like an inevitable revelation than a contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s quest to understand time’s crisis-slowing—is clear, but the pressure is largely intellectual and spiritual rather than situational. There is a meaningful deepening when the ink patterns cause the ground and Kael’s outline to “dissolve,” tying his body to the conceptual risk of oblivion, yet this danger never fully sharpens into a concrete threat or forced trade-off. His final decision to turn anger into purpose is thematically apt but not heavily tested by on-page resistance. Overall, conflict escalates conceptually, not viscerally, which limits impact at a top-tier standard.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stakes—liberation of the oppressed versus fragile peace—are large, but they remain abstract, with no specific oppressed group, no named consequence for failure, and no on-page opposition. Pressure does not visibly tighten after the inciting act; once the letter is sent, everything important happens as an almost frictionless cascade. There is no real reversal or moment where Maren’s choice is tested or costs her something visible beyond generic risk of “frozen preservation.” The piece reads more as a lyrical vignette about a successful provocation than as a conflict-driven scene with escalating trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—emotional and communal recovery after the tower’s fall—is clear, but opposition is almost entirely absent. Lira encounters no resistance from people, environment, or herself; every gesture toward hope is immediately affirmed (roses respond, boy finds calm, villagers readily join). There is minimal escalation beyond a gentle widening from Lira alone to the whole community. As a result, the ending feels serene rather than hard-won, with little sense of options foreclosed or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—attaining the goddess’s echo—is clear, but the pressure remains abstract and gentle, with no real sense of what he risks losing if he fails or succeeds. Escalation is mostly textural: the garden’s pulses intensify, the constellations tangle, and he chants and raises the spike at the “moment,” yet nothing meaningfully pushes back. His agency is present (choosing to follow the resonance, then to “aim it skyward” and chant), but these choices never force a trade-off or visible sacrifice. The result is a beautifully staged ritual that lacks genuine tension or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unearthing the ledger that could upend the city’s power structure—is clearly signaled. However, the path to success is remarkably smooth: the console recognizes the nib, the proof-by-contradiction process runs, and the ledger is found without real obstruction or cost. The siren and opening of the archives are powerful conceptually, but they arrive as automatic consequences rather than hard-won outcomes under pressure. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady unveiling than a tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Lyra reconfigure the haunted machinery to soothe sorrow and her own guilt—is clear, and the story does move from private obsession to a communal healing function. However, resistance is largely conceptual; the haunted firmware “untangles” without much depicted struggle, and there are no real reversals or difficult trade-offs on the page. The escalation feels more like a steady unfurling of a plan than a tightening of pressure that forces a costly choice. As a result, the stakes read as meaningful but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—transmuting “lilac unease” into meaningful calm—is clear, but the conflict remains predominantly internal and gently pressured. The main tightening is Liora’s decision to actively question the tile and channel the hush through the mandala, but there is no credible risk of failure or alternative path weighed on the page. Once she starts the ritual, events proceed smoothly toward resolution. As a result, escalation is present but soft, without a felt cost or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are essentially conceptual: can a new, “aberrant” form of mercy be forged for a traumatized city. Pressure doesn’t significantly escalate; once he names Hearthsteel, there is no real resistance or cost to manifesting this new order. The story largely skips beats where the mission might be tested, opposed, or risk failure. As a result, the resolution, though thematically aligned, feels granted rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the ghost can transform his lost applause into a meaningful, hopeful encore—is established, but pressure never truly tightens. Once the orchard appears, the ritual proceeds without serious resistance or risk; the echoes work on first try, and the passerby’s entrance is convenient rather than contested. There’s no real sense that failure is possible or would carry an on-page cost. The ending’s emotional shift lands, but escalation feels more like a gentle swell than a tested turning.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is Mara testing whether intention and somatic markers can replace a telepathy pill—essentially, can she turn skepticism into generative understanding. Pressure modestly deepens as she builds the feedback loop and attempts to recall the “telepathy pill” effect unaided. There is a turn at the moment of contact and the choice to send data, but there’s little sense of risk, opposition, or sacrifice; failure would cost her mainly disappointment. As a result, escalation feels soft and largely conceptual rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the caves’ “voice” can be mapped and made legible before humans re-emerge—is present but very gentle; pressure never tightens beyond a contemplative ritual. Escalation is mainly textural (more droplets, greater glow, the whole network pulsing) rather than a narrowing of options or heightening of cost. Her agency drives the ritual to completion, but there is no real threat of failure or trade-off, and no clear loss or sacrifice on the page. As a result, tension is low even for a quiet, lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—whether Mara can decipher the prophecy and enable time’s reversal—is conceptually large but experientially gentle on the page. Process intensifies (from cataloging to arranging to stepping onto the bridge), yet no real alternative, risk, or sacrifice is dramatized; every move works as soon as she attempts it. There’s little sense of what might be lost if she fails or how it would cost her to refuse this role. Escalation thus reads as a linear ritual rather than pressured conflict with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—inner redemption and “fixing what’s broken”—is clear, but the on-page conflict is largely frictionless. Once the system (snow codes + pillbox) is in place, each step succeeds without genuine resistance, and his guilt never actively blocks him from action. The one tightening—the realization that unused courage is a state, not a place—reframes his goal but doesn’t force a painful trade-off or visible sacrifice. Tension remains more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Arlen’s need to reconcile a layered, regret-tinged promise into a clear understanding—is established, but pressure never tightens beyond a gentle countdown to the gutters’ silence. There is no real alternative path or meaningful risk to him if the river doesn’t “answer,” so the stakes feel abstract. His agency consists mainly in choosing to attend and to interpret the eventual calm as acceptance, a choice with little visible cost. As a result, escalation is more tonal than structural and remains relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the oasis can be gently awakened without erasing its resistant, fractured nature—is clear but very low in overt tension. There is some escalation from testing the thrum to awakening the first hive, yet Mara encounters no real resistance, risk, or difficult trade-off. Her agency is present but unchallenged: she listens, moves the lantern, and succeeds. As a result, the narrative feels more like a meditative ritual than a conflict that forces hard choices or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can gently push back the harbor’s dread with light—is clear but low-intensity. Internal or external opposition is essentially absent; nothing seriously threatens her plan, so tension comes mostly from the initial “quivering hush” and the ritual wait for the last petal. Once she decides to act, the process unfolds smoothly, with no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. As a result, the escalation reads as a steady glide rather than a tightening, limiting the sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform her solitude into a shared, agentive chorus—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening from ritual attempt to awakened library to her personal vow at the edge. Yet conflict remains relatively frictionless: the ritual succeeds without resistance, the coexistence with the sky-whale ghost is harmonious, and no serious alternative or failure mode is tested. Internal and external pressure interweave only lightly; her confidence “brittle awakenings” are asserted more than they are jeopardized. As a result, escalation feels gentle and lyrical rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain a passive keeper of unsent secrets or actively rejoin and release them—is present but soft. There is some escalation as her actions elicit stronger responses from the installation, culminating in the pulsing spiral and silver light, but there’s no real sense of risk or a meaningful option foreclosed; saying yes appears entirely upside. Without a credible negative consequence or strong internal resistance, tension stays low and the “pressure” reads more like ceremonial progression than conflict. This undercuts the intensity of the climax despite the visual spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clearly sketched—campus division, manipulative cosmic tricksters, potential panic—yet the conflict remains oddly frictionless. Once Mara sets up her interference, the tricksters’ “attack” (the false solar flare alarm) is neutralized instantly without setback, sacrifice, or hard trade-off. The communal humming and dean’s assembly read as confirmation rather than hard-won outcome. The piece needs at least one genuine complication or threatened loss to deepen pressure before the turn toward unity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—securing the key and navigating severe claustrophobia—are clear early and interwoven. Pressure rises when the compass activates, the walls “quiver,” and a new, potentially crushing passage unfolds, forcing him to choose between withdrawing to safety or advancing. However, after he commits, the path offers no real reversal or complication; success comes with little resistance beyond reiterated internal fear. The result is a meaningful but relatively gentle escalation, more contemplative than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can coax the quarry/stone into yielding the truth of the cold cases and reawaken her own empathy—is clear but remains largely conceptual. Pressure technically escalates (from painting to the quarry cracking and revealing names), yet Mara encounters no real resistance, competing obligation, or moral dilemma; she simply performs her method and is rewarded. The fissure and name-revelation qualify as a meaningful tightening/turn, but the absence of real cost or narrowed options makes the conflict feel gentle rather than exacting. Stakes are haunting in idea yet not fully visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting the ancestor’s story and its embodiment in the nail—is clear and sharpened when the low-pressure vortex threatens the station. There is a genuine turn when Mara chooses to stay and protect the chamber instead of defaulting to physical safety, tying internal and external stakes together. However, escalation plateaus quickly: the crew agrees off-page, the sealing of the chamber proceeds smoothly, and the storm passes without on-page loss, so tension never quite bites. The moral calculus feels firm but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering/forgiving the vanished hitchhiker and then extending amnesty to others—is clear but largely abstract and unopposed. Once the legend is accepted, success follows a nearly unchallenged “and-then” sequence: find map, climb, play, obtain miracle. There is one mild tightening (the summit performance that might or might not work), but no real resistance, trade-off, or visible price for the achievement. As a result, tension and escalation remain modest despite the rich concept.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—how Arlen chooses to structure journeys (his own and others’) so they don’t collapse into destructive loops—is clear but remains mostly internal and philosophical. Externally, the startup’s funding and collapse provide situational stakes, yet these beats are largely summarized, so we seldom feel concrete jeopardy around a single decision. The main on-page tightening is Arlen’s choice to install and defend the territorial markers, and later to walk away from LoopForge toward a new map; both are thoughtful but low-friction choices. As a result, pressure is coherent but soft, never fully cornering him into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can decode the temple inscriptions and relieve the “burden” of secrecy—is stated, but pressure around it remains abstract and gentle. Once she receives the telegram, her alignment with its instruction leads almost immediately to success; there is no meaningful setback, trade-off, or moment where an option is foreclosed. Internal and external conflicts are lightly gestured at (“fracture within her own doubts”) but never bite hard enough to feel like stakes. As a result, tension plateaus and the ‘turn’ at the temple door opening feels inevitable rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the frozen confession without letting memory-devouring magic do harm—is articulated, and the ritual itself provides a baseline of tension. But there is no real escalation: no failed attempt, backlash, or moment where the seed almost turns outward; each step works on the first try. Internal conflict (her guardedness vs. opening) is resolved with little on-page cost, so pressure never tightens into a truly consequential choice. The conflict feels conceptually rich but dramatically under-leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—realizing the eclipsed covenant to guide her people—is clear but remains largely abstract, described in terms of “collective longing” and “dreams dictating destiny.” There is essentially no opposing force: the maze parts for her, the clipping offers power without resistance, and the portal and beacon activate without misstep or consequence. Internal and external tension never truly escalate; “anxious elation” gestures at pressure but is never tested by a meaningful trade-off or risk. Escalation is more a sequence of upgrades than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can Maelia use the orchard and the card to mend her inner void—is present but never truly feels in doubt. There is a gentle escalation from first sigil to placing the card in the pulsing hollow, yet each step succeeds without resistance, reversal, or visible trade-off. The “bartered destinies” idea hints at a moral and metaphysical price, but no concrete harm, sacrifice, or narrowing of options is dramatized. As a result, tension remains low and the resolution, while coherent, feels largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can she reconstruct a sense of purpose after a humiliating, public professional failure—is clear and present throughout. Pressure is mostly internal and accumulative rather than driven by external obstacles; the main tightening is her movement from raw shame to a calm, risky resolve to redefine what “applause” means. There is limited escalation in the traditional sense, as beats like the truck dumping concrete are evocative but don’t raise costs so much as echo existing tension. The final choice is essentially an internal recommitment, with the price of relinquishing her old validation, which reads but remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can meaningfully understand and bridge the transition between matter and memory—is signaled, but opposition is almost entirely absent. The experiment with the seed proceeds without complication: the arbor responds positively, the spirit particles drift away, and her theory is “living proof” with no real risk of failure. There is some internal conflict implied by “haunted ambitions,” yet it never tightens into a choice with visible cost. As a result, escalation is minimal and tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be preserved when time and routine fracture—is present but operates at a meditative, low-pressure register. There is one clear escalation point when “tomorrow disappeared,” which necessitates forging the memory key, but subsequent moves unfold without strong resistance or real risk of failure. The internal conflict (guardian of routine vs. champion of migration/contradiction) is resolved more by insight than by agonized trade-off, keeping tension modest. The ending choice is earned but lacks a palpable price beyond a gentle reorientation of his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely pre-resolved: Mara arrives already willing, and nothing in the cave seriously opposes or complicates her goal. The pressure deepens a bit as she reads the confessions and feels her own heart open, but this reads as smooth transformation rather than a contested turn. Stakes remain abstract (walls between hearts) rather than being tested through a concrete dilemma or risk. As a result, escalation is gentle and the final vow feels significant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding a sustainable path toward self-forgiveness—is clear early and remains coherent. There is one meaningful tightening when the graffiti’s “map” forces the narrator to choose whether to follow it into the tunnel, committing to deeper confrontation with the river/self. However, tension remains relatively low-key and contemplative; there is little sense of risk that a different choice would have brought palpable harm or loss in the moment. The closure stance is earned, but escalation feels like a gentle deepening rather than a sharp narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain highly abstract—discovery and wonder—without any sense of risk, loss, or potential failure. Each threshold (latch, chamber, crystal, final gate) opens on cue, so pressure never really tightens. “Propagation delays” and the cipher are tools, not constraints that force hard trade-offs. The result is a beautifully described tour rather than a conflict-driven progression, which undercuts narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the floating city remains independent or is subsumed by the empire—is clearly drawn and escalated by the looming pact and fading glow. Elara’s decision to weave the vines’ dissent into the violin’s song is an effective tightening that aligns internal and external stakes. However, opposition is underdeveloped: the empire’s envoy yields after a single powerful chord, and no serious counterpressure or visible cost tests her stance. As a result, tension never quite reaches a truly fraught, consequential peak for a piece aiming at top-tier literary competition.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early, but it remains largely abstract in the moment-to-moment action. There is minimal escalation: once she begins, nothing seriously threatens failure, and her process unfolds smoothly without reversal or hard choice. The pressure is mostly rhetorical (“before the world slipped into oblivion”) rather than dramatized through setbacks or narrowing options. As a result, the resolution feels more like the completion of a careful procedure than a truly tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain primarily internal and gently articulated: Mara wants contentment and continuity in her care. The storm sequence hints at external pressure but resolves smoothly, with little sense that failure is possible or costly. There’s one main deepening—the sunrise ritual and resultant inner shift—but no significant narrowing of options or forced trade-off. The piece reads more as a meditative tableau than a story driven by escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether the magistrate’s decree will remain rigid or be opened to nuance—is conceptually strong but never faces genuine resistance. Mara encounters no real opposition; the wind chimes yield a decipherable pattern, the mirror works on first try, and the knot loosens without complication. There is one clear escalation beat when she physically unhooks the decree, but the choice costs neither her nor the magistrate anything palpable in the moment. As a result, tension stays low and the ethical complexity is gestured at rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform her curse-like reverse aging into a teachable, meaningful art—is present but not strongly pressured in-scene. The legend’s condition (withholding the urge to see) sets up a potential internal battle, yet her endurance is barely tested; she moves from intention to fulfillment without real jeopardy or near-failure. The magnetic pull and vortex escalate imagery rather than conflict, and no live option is dramatically foreclosed. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is stated early, but pressure around it never tightens; nothing concrete threatens her, the canyon, or the opportunity. Each development (arrowhead resonance, bird patterns, internal map) proceeds smoothly, with no serious doubt about success. The “cost” is mostly conceptual (choosing understanding over motion) rather than dramatized as a trade-off or loss. This keeps the conflict from escalating beyond a meditative quest, which limits narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Selric can claim a non-spectacular, sacred form of magic in a world of automated spectacle—is clear, and the piece does escalate from hovering at the base to the risky mist walk and culminating contact with the stone. However, external and internal resistance are both minimal; nothing seriously threatens to stop him once he begins, and his doubts are quickly sublimated into lyric description rather than concrete hesitation or failure. The key turn (unstrapping the book and stepping onto the mist) is meaningful but happens without real contest. As a result, the felt cost and tightening under pressure are present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual and emotional—fulfilling a vow, finding a new language for sound—rather than situationally urgent. There is a single, gentle tightening (the descent and the choice to open the glowing book), but no real resistance, danger, or risk of failure. Coincidences (the key working, the book responding) all favor him, and nothing forces a trade-off or real sacrifice. As a result, tension is low; it’s a beautifully described journey more than a tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Silas finding/confirming his purpose before universal collapse—is intelligible and thematically apt, but the on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and low-friction. Once he starts decoding the coins, nothing truly resists him; each step yields neatly to the next without a credible possibility of failure or alternative path. The scholar’s warning about static being a double-edged sword hints at potential chaos, yet no tangible cost or consequence is dramatized. Escalation is thus more conceptual than pressurized, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can transmute nameless dread and personal grief into something articulated and therefore releasable—is clear but stays largely internal and contemplative. Naming each monster is a progression, yet the sequence lacks a sharp tightening beat where a real option closes or a serious risk emerges. There’s minimal sense that she might fail, refuse, or be harmed by misnaming, so tension remains low-grade rather than knife-edge. As a result, the ending is moving but not hard-won in terms of on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic and ecological balance—is clearly signaled, and the alignment of drip rhythm with the bell’s healing provides a gentle deepening. Yet the process unfolds with little resistance: irregular droplets are observed and then simply settle into a steady pulse without serious jeopardy or rethinking. The mage never faces a meaningful trade-off or credible risk of failure, so escalation feels mostly like unfolding inevitability rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the town can shed a damaging myth—is clear, but pressure never meaningfully tightens beyond the initial mission statement. There is no opposition, logistical obstacle, or moral trade-off; the photos yield insights, the town gathers, and they accept the new narrative without resistance. As a result, the arc lacks a sharp turn or visible cost, reading more like a ritual unfolding than a conflict resolved. The quiet mode is fine, but some additional friction or risk would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—achieving harmony between logic and intuition—is articulated but rarely feels at risk. The ritual proceeds almost entirely without setback or hard choice, so escalation reads as a smooth progression of wonders rather than pressure tightening. There’s no competing good or tangible fear to force Selene into a trade-off. As a result, the climax is beautiful but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving trust and fulfilling the watcher’s burden—is signaled, but on-page pressure is soft: the repair proceeds without complication, and the storm remains mostly atmospheric rather than antagonistic. There is one main tightening (deciding to climb higher and revise the harness), but no meaningful reversal or test of his solution. Failure never feels like a live option, which keeps tension from truly escalating. The ending’s relief reads more as confirmation than as the outcome of a hard-won struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—custody of the Duplicate and Kael’s emotional reanimation—are clearly signaled, and the physical act of slicing the jar is a genuine tightening and turning point. However, pressure does not meaningfully escalate: the Guardians and Syndicate apply only verbal pressure, and Kael never appears to lack viable options or pay a visible price beyond brief tension. The resolution, where both factions quickly realign into harmonious coexistence, undercuts the prior framing of a “battle” and avoids any real trade-off. Internal and external conflicts conceptually interweave, but the actual on-page struggle feels too easy for the thematic ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can turn the seed into a functional, wondrous centerpiece—is signaled, but it never feels risky or contested. The puzzles are solved without hitch, and no alternative outcomes or trade-offs are seriously entertained, so pressure never truly tightens. Mara’s “choice” to use the seed creatively faces no internal or external opposition, which keeps tension low. The climax (the bloom) is visually striking but lacks a felt price or test of commitment, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring laughter to a joyless house—is established early, and the ritual’s intensification (dust peeling away, outlines of jokes assembling, the photograph giggling, the house reanimating) provides a discernible progression. However, resistance is essentially abstract “silence” rather than a force that adapts or pushes back, so tension feels more like a one-way crescendo than a contested struggle. The key turn is the photograph responding and the subsequent full-house revival, but the conductor never appears to risk failure or sacrifice beyond effort and emotion. Stakes are thematically rich but not viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical: whether to remain a guarding, waiting beast or to embrace uncertainty through the pendant and a new curatorial role. The appearance of the cultist’s pendant functions as the main tightening, adding the risk of a “slumbering breach,” but that danger stays abstract and never truly corners the guardian into a painful trade-off. Waiting is framed as both punishment and promise, yet her decision to keep waiting while wearing the pendant doesn’t appreciably narrow options on the page. The stakes feel aesthetically interesting rather than urgent, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—revive the crozier to break his “crystal cage” of destiny—is clear early and remains coherent. There is escalation via successive approximations (first tincture, then phoenix feathers, then final cold flame), but each attempt succeeds more than it meaningfully endangers him, so pressure never quite sharpens into a true risk of loss. Internal conflict is not strongly opposed to his goal; his hopelessness doesn’t materially obstruct his actions. The result feels gently cumulative rather than tense, limiting the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the decaying tower-city can be reactivated and its endings reinterpreted—is declared but never truly endangered on the page. Once Selin decides to intervene, every step proceeds without friction: no technical failure, competing agenda, or inner hesitation complicates the path. Escalation is more a steady unveiling of effects than a tightening of options or a trade-off with visible cost. As a result, the ending satisfies conceptually but lacks tension and bite.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio can restore the vanished ferry and unify timelines—is legible, and his decision to enact the radio/hourglass ritual is a clear turning point. However, opposition is almost entirely notional; nothing pushes back, and the plan succeeds without serious complication or trade-off. The “when clocks run sideways” condition never manifests as real-time pressure or a narrowing of options. As a result, escalation feels more like an inevitable unveiling than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—“discover the texture of connection”—and never face a concrete test or risk beyond mild existential unease. The eruptions and dissolving walls represent turns, but they don’t threaten failure or impose cost; each new development simply cooperates with his desire. There is no meaningful tightening where a path is foreclosed or a trade-off is forced. As conflict, it functions more as an illustrated meditation than a pressured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—expanding navigational horizons from trench to stars—is clear but remains largely abstract and unopposed. The launch of the first test vessel could serve as a tightening beat, yet it unfolds without real risk, resistance, or visible alternative paths. There is no substantive reversal or hard trade-off, only a steady march toward success. As a result, conflict feels low-grade and stakes are more conceptual aspiration than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman’s lingering voice will be heard and preserved—is clearly articulated early and pursued throughout. Escalation is present but gentle: the pulse strengthens, the setting becomes more charged, and the choir’s resonance culminates in the restoration of the photograph. There is no real opposing force, and the protagonist is never forced into a hard trade-off or true risk, so tension remains more conceptual than visceral. As a result, the ending satisfies on a lyrical level but lacks the sharper sense of price or narrowing options expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared—dimensional stranding, suffocating void, her own claustrophobia—but they remain largely hypothetical, never biting into her options. The only real tightening is the tide reaching its apex to trigger the arrays, and even that functions more as a scheduled event than a live deadline Mara must adapt around. She never fails, improvises, or pays a visible price for her choice to proceed; the conflict is atmospheric rather than dramatic. As a result, tension plateaus instead of escalating toward a genuinely fraught decision.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the ghost’s death-loop from overwriting her mind while reclaiming her status as living—is well signaled, and the procedural sequence gives a sense of forward motion. However, there’s minimal resistance or reversal; once she begins the ink-ritual, nothing truly threatens to fail or complicate her plan on the page. The “cost” is mostly conceptual and retrospective rather than something she must pay via a difficult choice in-scene. Pressure thus feels steady rather than tightening, more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can he tame the echo tunnel and preserve the dying language’s textures—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when he risks activating the cursed diamond and the tunnel begins to answer. However, pressure remains mostly conceptual; neither the curse nor failure feels concretely dangerous to him beyond abstract legacy loss. Escalation is a steady deepening of pattern and resonance rather than a sharp reversal or narrowed choice set, so while the conflict is coherent, the felt cost and tension remain relatively low for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—complete the mission by turning the creature’s bitterness into a cosmic joke—is stated but never feels precarious. Once the narrator enters the garden and uses the arrowhead, events unfold without true resistance or complication: the phone obligingly confesses, the vines help, the laughter arrives, and the transformation succeeds on the first attempt. There is one main tightening (arrowhead shattering and releasing light), but no meaningful reversal or option foreclosed beyond losing a tool. As a result, tension is modest, and the resolution feels more like an ordained ritual than a hard-won outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty can subvert a rigid mechanical order—is clear, and there is a recognizable tightening when the bronze statue confronts him and the regime’s intolerance is named. However, opposition is underdeveloped: the statue’s demand lacks teeth, and once he plays the heart-driven note, the conflict melts with minimal struggle or trade-off. Escalation is more a steady amplification of imagery than a pressured narrowing of options, and the outcome feels foregone rather than hard-won. The cost of defying the regime never materializes as real danger.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Milo can use this one crossing to open a path toward peace—is clear and does tighten as the drone approaches. His choice to deploy the storm, risk detection, and then slip in the envelope provides a credible escalation. However, danger and cost remain largely conceptual; the drones retreat rather easily and we never feel what Milo or either faction stands to lose in visceral terms. The second drone’s appearance as peaceful response resolves things a bit too smoothly for maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict and stakes remain mostly abstract (“silence as possibility”) and are never concretely threatened or opposed. Each step Mara takes is smoothly rewarded—gears respond, fog reveals, doors open—without real risk, resistance, or trade-off. The dominant stake (will the circus’s silence be translated into song?) is answered affirmatively with no chance of failure once the process begins. As a result, escalation feels like a steady intensification of spectacle rather than a pressured test of desire or resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—reawakening analog memories so stories can “truly live”—is clear but remains abstract and low-risk; nothing important seems likely to break if Mara fails. Pressure escalates texturally (the scarf glowing, field intensifying, walls dissolving, projection appearing), but Mara is never forced into a trade-off or moral dilemma. Her main “choice” is to initiate and then gently regulate the process, and the system cooperates without resistance. As a result, the climax is lovely but not tense, and the sense of cost or foreclosed paths is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can “capture” or reconnect the runaway dream/pearl—is clear but remains safely abstract, with no palpable risk if she fails. There is a mild escalation from private practice to an actual response (Lio catching the filament), but there’s no on-page resistance, setback, or trade-off that forces her into a truly costly choice. The dream returns to the sea at the end, yet this doesn’t land as a loss so much as gentle fulfillment, which blunts tension. As a result, the piece works more as atmospheric fable than as a pressured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is stated early, but the opposition is almost entirely conceptual and never meaningfully bites. The “disorienting” cobblestones and the tiny groove discovery hint at obstacles but do not significantly narrow options or force trade-offs. Once the star appears, each turn proceeds smoothly to success without complication or visible loss. As a result, tension remains low and the resolution, while thematically apt, feels insufficiently earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring stolen memories—is clear, but it never truly sharpens into a dilemma or risk; success feels preordained once she arrives. Her actions escalate procedurally (mapping, moving hull to hull, aligning the sextant and mushroom), yet no option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. There’s no credible reversal or complication; each step works on the first try. As a result, tension remains mostly conceptual and lyrical rather than felt as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—ending the library’s “reversible exile” by restoring its stories—is signaled early and maintained throughout, with a meaningful tightening when the noon alignment and the distant crack in the far wing enter. However, antagonistic pressure is largely abstract (centuries of neglect, exile as concept) and never credibly threatens to upset her plans; each step she takes works more or less as foretold without costly trade-offs. The nervous backward-walking and the brief startle at the crack add micro-tension but not genuine jeopardy. As a result, escalation reads as smooth deepening rather than sharp narrowing of options or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is a declared stake—preserving and spreading wonder—but very little real opposition or escalation; events mostly unfold smoothly once the seed is activated. The storm is the only overt threat and is dispelled almost immediately by his song, without a sense of risk or potential failure. The traveler’s arrival offers a chance for moral or practical conflict (what does the pruner lose by giving away the sprig?) but it’s handled as an effortless generosity. As a result, the narrative feels meditative rather than pressured, limiting conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can settle the restless spirits—is present but mostly abstract, with little sense of consequence if she fails beyond continued unrest. The process from first knot to last doesn’t meaningfully tighten pressure; it’s a steady, almost assured progression rather than a narrowing corridor of options. There is no real antagonist or serious internal resistance, and no major trade-off or visible price is paid beyond effort. As a result, the piece is textured but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely internal and thematic, with minimal opposition: her task to reopen the chapel proceeds without setbacks or meaningful risk. The apparent escalation—aligning footage, revealing glyphs, reframing the tear as portal—is a deepening of insight rather than a tightening of pressure or a forced trade-off. As a result, the piece feels contemplative rather than driven, with little sense of genuine cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Mort can reinterpret loss as transformation rather than simple surrender—and this is signaled early and revisited. However, conflict is largely philosophical; there is little external pressure, risk, or concrete dilemma to escalate, so tension stays low. The main “tightening” is the moment the last strand snaps and the transmission plays, which does deepen the emotional stakes but doesn’t force a hard trade-off. As a result, the resolution feels contemplative rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—giving the ghost a felt voice—remains fairly abstract and gentle, with no opposing pressure beyond the risk of being unheard. The three-lightning structure provides a clear pattern of deepening contact but no sharp tightening where options narrow or a meaningful alternative is foreclosed. The balladeer’s choices (which flower to press, whether to respond) lack visible downside or internal conflict. As a result, the piece is beautiful but low-tension, reading more as a ritual of fulfillment than a conflict-driven transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering buried joy for the sorrowful spire—is conceptually strong but rarely feels pressured in the moment. Once the legend is revealed, every step toward the goal proceeds smoothly; there are no reversals, obstacles, or forced trade-offs that narrow his options. Internal conflict is also minimal: his motivation never wavers, so there is little tension between want and cost. As a result, the emotional payoff is pleasant rather than earned under real strain.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria can meaningfully memorialize the tragedy and prove that emptiness remembers—remains mostly internal and unopposed. There is little escalation beyond deepening imagery: no real threat that she will fail or pay a visible price; the comet appears as a confirming wonder rather than a test. Her key “decision” is to perform and complete her ritual, which never feels in doubt. As a result, tension is low even though the mood is charged.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sky inside before demolition—exists and is time-bounded, but pressure remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally escalating. The coin’s timings and ritual layering are introduced as a kind of constraint, yet they never truly threaten failure or force Lira into a risky deviation, so there’s little tightening beyond the clock ticking toward noon. The demolition itself happens almost offhandedly at the end; Lira doesn’t have to adapt tactics in response, she simply finishes and then the building falls. As a result, the conflict never quite sharpens into a difficult choice with clear cost, keeping escalation mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—harnessing stranded luminance without draining the ship—is stated but never truly tested; everything works on the first try with minimal resistance. Conflict is primarily procedural (decoding and aligning symbols) rather than adversarial or morally fraught. There’s one gentle escalation when the halo appears and then intensifies, but no option is meaningfully foreclosed and no sacrifice is required. This keeps tension low and makes the piece feel more like an elegant vignette than a story under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring a broken mechanism/time to understand “the rhythm of repair”—is clear but remains abstract and low-pressure. There is no real resistance: prophecy appears conveniently, the hall is found without difficulty, the key works on first attempt, and no alternative path is seriously endangered. Escalation is mostly tonal (light intensifying, mirrors rippling) rather than through narrowed options or risks. As a result, the climax reads as a ritual completion rather than a hard-won resolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can the community unite to channel hope and reorient resource-sharing—exists but feels largely assured from the outset because “the villagers…had learned to trust the ghost’s guidance.” The build toward ringing the bell at the nebula’s peak is a structural tightening, yet it never seems in doubt and faces no meaningful obstacle. Liora’s final chalk message about sharing resources sketches a moral adjustment without dramatized conflict around scarcity or resistance. As a result, tension is gentle and atmospheric rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can grant the world a pause at the edge of doomsday—is potent in concept but soft in on-page pressure. The sea’s pounding and the ticking offer a felt countdown, yet Elara never seriously risks failure or faces a live alternative path; once she begins, success feels nearly guaranteed. The main tightening is the pane of hush manifesting and her sensing “the moment where the world could pause,” which is more a recognition than a hard-won turn. As a result, tension remains largely atmospheric rather than escalating through choices with visible prices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—completing the ritual before frost and guiding travelers to safety—are legible, and there is one clear tightening as the caretaker approaches the stump with birds circling and frost impending. However, opposition remains mostly abstract: the birds “watch” rather than impede, the frost never nearly wins, and the curse itself exerts no active resistance in the scene. As a result, the protagonist’s success feels somewhat foregone, with limited sense of trade-off beyond emotional exhaustion and ongoing curse. The piece reads as strong situational pressure but with only modest escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming a professional failure and grief into a connective, healing technology—is clear, but on-page pressure is gentle. Once the insight arrives, every major step (building the reed scaffold, polymer success, colleagues’ acceptance, regional adoption) proceeds without meaningful resistance or trade-off. There is no real test of the idea or ethical/moral pinch point; tension comes mostly from tone and symbolism rather than hard choices. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unfolding than a tightening, limiting the category.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no opposition: the vendor’s desire meets no real friction, and every step of the ritual proceeds smoothly. Stakes remain abstract—“incise a new narrative into the collective consciousness”—without a concrete risk if he fails or cost if he succeeds. The appearance of the child offers an opportunity for tension or transfer of burden, but it’s handled as harmonious succession. As a result, pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten, and the ending lands more as a graceful flourish than as a charged turn.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—transform collective remorse into something bearable—is clear but remains largely abstract and unopposed in practice. Once Lir begins the ritual, each step proceeds without internal or external resistance, and the contagion mechanic never corners him into a trade-off or sacrifice. There is a mild escalation as the pavilion cracks and the fortress glows, but options never feel narrowed or threatened. As a result, tension is more meditative than pressurized, which undercuts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are conceptually large (healing a scarred industrial city), but on the page there is almost no friction or escalation: everything and everyone—including the grain elevators—falls quickly into harmony once the ritual begins. The librarian’s agency initiates events, but she never faces a trade-off, loss, or serious risk of failure; no option is foreclosed in a way we feel. The main “tightening” is purely textural as sound layers, rather than a true pressure spike. As a result, tension remains low and the outcome feels foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria can truly interface with and awaken the canyon’s abandoned dreams—is present from early on and does tighten when the canyon hums back and the tremor threatens her fragile setup. Still, there is little real opposition; the tremor is brief, and she pushes on without needing to sacrifice, change tactics, or choose between competing goods. The risk of the stone fracturing is mentioned but never dramatized into consequence or a meaningful trade-off. As a result, tension stays gentle and meditative rather than escalating into a decisive, costly test.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations for the library—is clear but remains largely abstract and unopposed. Once Liora qualifies for entry, her path is smooth: the cipher resolves without true resistance, and no alternative or failure mode is ever seriously tested. The hour of inverted gravity and the grotto’s dangers are described atmospherically but not dramatized as obstacles that force trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening wonder than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Auris can coax empathetic music from silence—is clear but remains mostly abstract and unopposed. Pressure “escalates” via increasing density of musical attempts and the eventual involvement of the grove’s creatures, rather than through concrete obstacles or trade-offs. Auris never faces a genuine risk of failure, loss, or moral tension; his commitment is affirmed rather than tested. As a result, the ending is affecting but low in dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing or reawakening the eclipsed covenant—remains mostly internal and symbolic, with little concrete jeopardy. There is some escalation as the pulses intensify, he listens deeper, speaks the phrase, and the sky answers, but options never feel meaningfully narrowed or risky. “Before the next phase” is introduced as a clock but never forces a trade-off or sacrifice. The resolution reads as a gentle deepening of stance rather than a pressured choice with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can unlock and meaningfully “read” the diary of silences—is present but under-pressured. Once he sets up the crystal plates, nothing opposes him; there’s no real risk of misalignment, misreading, or backlash, and his internal doubts under the ritual are barely gestured at. The transition from workshop ritual to public rooftop revelation is a scale jump without added resistance, so escalation reads more as enlargement than tightening. The outcome feels assured, which blunts tension despite the pretty cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict remains almost entirely abstract: the elders warn of patience, but Lira encounters no real obstacle beyond the passage of time. The corpse flower’s rumored condition (blooming only when a heart balances hope and humility) never creates a credible risk or moment of near-failure; it simply works. Pressure does not tighten in a meaningful way—each beat is another gentle step toward an outcome that feels guaranteed. As a result, the climax reads as fulfillment of expectation rather than a tested choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mission is said to be “simple but vital,” yet on the page there is almost no real resistance—no failed attempts, time pressure bite, or threat of loss if she fails. The discovery of the arrow tip is quick and relatively frictionless once she lowers the probe. The hour of inverted gravity and the importance of resilience are conceptually high-stakes but not dramatized as urgent or dangerous in this specific outing. As a result, escalation is more informational than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—neutralizing lingering storm energy before it is re-triggered—is conceptually present but kept abstract, with no specific threat or deadline on the page. Pressure escalates mildly as data converge on the central tower and a “waiting trigger” is implied. Mara’s main “choice” is to signal the control tower once her map confirms the convergence; there are no serious alternatives, setbacks, or trade-offs. As a result, the resolution reads more like the planned outcome of an orderly procedure than a hard-won turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract—whether wonder is “certified as essential”—and there is no real opposition, risk, or dilemma to escalate. The ritual proceeds smoothly from beginning to end, with no turn that narrows her options or tests her commitment. Internal conflict is absent; her want and world are already aligned to allow the act. As a result, tension stays low and the ending, while pretty, doesn’t feel paid for in any concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—redefining guardianship by harvesting insights from failure—is clearly signaled, but almost no antagonistic pressure or concrete risk ever challenges it. Once she commits to the ritual, every step proceeds smoothly: the markers work, the seam opens, the crossing succeeds, and she returns unscathed. The only “tightening” is the seam widening at her note, which reads more as fulfillment than escalation. As a result, conflict feels largely conceptual and the sense of price or trade-off at the peak is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—Mara’s quest to decode the mathematics of emotion—is present but remains largely abstract, with minimal sense of what she risks losing or breaking apart personally. The main “escalation” is the activation and eventual cracking of the halo fragment, which deepens the conceptual stakes but doesn’t clearly foreclose options or force a difficult trade-off. Her decision to keep returning and to further disorient herself is framed as a continuation rather than as a pressured choice with evident cost. Tension is therefore primarily intellectual and atmospheric, not truly felt as conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain consistently low and largely abstract: the risk is whether lives will be infused with wonder, but there is no articulated danger, opposition, or credible chance of failure. Each encounter (shepherd, girl, later merchants) is resolved quickly and positively once the pendant is used, so pressure never really tightens. The courier never has to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price to pursue his goal. As a result, the piece reads as a lyrical exposition of a premise rather than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she prove that objects absorb and express emotion, and what does that mean for her—is clear and resolved. Pressure accumulates texturally as the hush deepens, light spreads, and grief pulses, with a meaningful intensification when the car engine unexpectedly starts. However, conflict is largely one-sided discovery: there’s no real friction, risk of failure, or trade-off dramatized beyond abstract responsibility. The result is a beautiful escalation in image but a relatively low-stakes emotional test for a piece aiming at the “highest echelon.”

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring sound and sending a promise—is present, and there is a formal escalation from oppressive silence to humming renewal. But the journey poses no real obstacles or dilemmas: each puzzle piece clicks into place without opposition, and the “sacrifice” occurs more as proclamation than tested choice. As a result, tension stays low and options never feel meaningfully narrowed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—gaining resilience for himself and his broken world—is signaled early and paid off in the final healing of the ground. Yet escalation is muted: the mines open for him with minimal resistance, there’s no serious risk of refusal or misfire from the silk, and the forging and public reveal proceed without setbacks or competing pressures. The sole real trade-off is the sacrificed memory, and once paid, everything flows smoothly. As a result, tension exists more as atmospheric promise than as sharp, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and then acting on the withheld truth about the evacuation—is clear and escalates conceptually with the sealed log’s revelation. However, conflict is mostly abstract: the shard and maps obey her will without serious resistance, and there’s no antagonist or significant counter-force once the truth is known. The ethical calculus (freeing the frozen crew versus preserving the commander’s choice) is under-dramatized; Lira’s ultimate decision arrives quickly and unambiguously. The piece has stakes, but the pressure rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is emotional/ritualistic: whether Marek can preserve or recreate a sense of safety and meaning in a failing lighthouse. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through concrete obstacles, and external stakes (a dark beacon, a lone fishing boat) never truly bite—no ship is in visible danger, and no one opposes him. The main tightening is the lamp finally flickering out, triggering the stone spiral’s pulse and solidifying his decision to carry the sea glass as a talisman. Still, the conflict remains mostly abstract and inward, with little sense of risk if he failed or chose otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—using the ritual to avert or redirect prophetic storms and midwife a transformed dawn—is present, but its on-page jeopardy feels abstract. There is minor escalation when Mira reads the symbols and says “We must act now,” and the subsequent steering of the serpent of light toward the hidden reef raises the scale conceptually. Still, opposition and cost are largely implied; nothing actively resists them, and the ritual proceeds without reversal or visible sacrifice. As a result, the pressure tightens somewhat but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict and stakes remain mostly conceptual: will Lira uncover the nature of story-magnet people and accept her role. There is escalation in knowledge (tea house to scroll to garden to loom), but virtually no real opposition, risk, or trade-off—each step opens easily and grants exactly what she seeks. Her acceptance of responsibility carries faint implied cost (ongoing vigilance, guardianship), yet that price is barely dramatized. The result is beautiful but low-tension, with pressure that never truly tightens or forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli can transform the labyrinth’s quantified sorrow into peace—is understandable but remains abstract and low-pressure. There is no real threat of failure, time limit, or counter-force; once Eli starts, each step succeeds without reversal or genuine cost. The story deepens texturally rather than tightening conflict, so tension feels meditative instead of suspenseful. As a result, the resolution reads as gently inevitable rather than truly earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving a world from perpetual night—is enormous but remains abstractly secure because nothing on the page seriously threatens failure. Lira never faces a hard choice, sacrifice, or setback; each action predictably deepens success (more light, more growth, more spirits). The pressure therefore feels more ceremonial than precarious, with no turn that truly narrows options or exacts a visible price. The result is formally coherent but dramatically under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he will confront his old mistake by entering the paradoxical library—is clear and foregrounded by the midnight deadline and his oscillation between hiding and answering the invitation. Pressure escalates from attic indecision to stepping through the hatch to the intimate confrontation with the curator and mirror. However, after he crosses into the library there’s relatively little resistance; the curator is benevolent, and the “key” comes quickly once he speaks his motive, making the conflict feel gentle rather than sharply testing. The moral cost is there but kept at a reflective simmer rather than a boil.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and very low-intensity: the “pressure” is the risk of the world sliding into the ordinary without being sanctified by attention. Escalation is mild—the key turn is discovering the loaf and then choosing to ritualize it at the tea house—but the narrative never truly tests his commitment or forces a trade-off. There’s no clear moment where an option is foreclosed or a visible price is paid beyond a gentle ache of transience. As a result, the piece reads as beautifully textured but somewhat static in terms of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning and memory can be stabilized against oblivion—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. There is a mild escalation as frequencies shift, the sky “dissolves,” and the light intensifies, but the process unfolds smoothly without a true threat of failure or trade-off. Her agency is real (choosing to persist, to measure exactly, to record and finally to speak the last vow) yet none of these decisions foreclose a meaningful alternative path. The piece functions more as an unbroken ritual than a pressure arc with visible prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—keep the truce by preventing the lantern theft—is articulated early and followed through, with one clear tightening when Lila hears the lock being forced and confronts the scout. However, escalation plateaus quickly; once the decoy moonshine goes off, her success feels nearly assured and the rival crew’s threat never bites back in a tangible way. The internal conflict around trust and her father’s legacy parallels the external problem but rarely sharpens her choices into true trade-offs. The final cost is more about ongoing unease than any concrete loss or compromise on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Arin’s drive to understand weather carriers—is clear but never faces real resistance or a meaningful trade-off. Pressure increases in a gentle, ritualistic way as more participants taste and the forest election concludes, but no option is foreclosed and no loss is felt. Escalation is primarily in density of imagery and information rather than in narrowed choices or heightened cost. As a result, the ending is satisfying conceptually but light on true tension.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can unlock the locker and thus her suppressed creativity—is coherent but feels low-pressure and almost guaranteed. Her “vow” to rectify the puzzle before sunrise gestures at a time constraint, yet no real consequence for failure is dramatized. Opposition is minimal (the lock’s brokenness) and resolves smoothly once she follows the guardian’s gaze; there’s little sense of trial, cost, or near-failure. The escalation from eerie attraction to effortless unlocking undershoots what the premise could bear.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether small acts of candor can repair a damaged world—is clear, and the pressure does deepen as she moves from private refusal to world-scale intervention. Yet obstacles are minimal: the map assembles without serious setback, the doorway appears promptly, and the vent responds powerfully to a single simple truth with no resistance. The council’s demand and potential danger never materialize as actual pressure in scene, so escalation feels smooth rather than testing or narrowing. The resolution is protagonist-driven but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high (“preserve the color of wonder”) but remain almost entirely abstract on the page; nothing truly threatens his ability to continue beyond a generalized fear of fading. Pressure does not notably escalate: morning tending, daytime witnessing, and evening reflection all affirm the same equilibrium. His “choice” is primarily ongoing endurance, which can be a valid Earned Stasis, but the cost of that endurance (loneliness, doubt, physical risk) is only faintly implied. As a result, tension exists as a gentle hum rather than a tightening strand.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—preventing a destructive burn-escape and resolving Vira’s inner static—are signaled and aligned, and her choice to use the box to contain the chaos functions as the main tightening. Yet escalation is soft: once the solution is proposed, everything unfolds smoothly, with no genuine risk that her tactics might fail or worsen the situation. External opposition is almost absent, so tension remains largely conceptual and tonal rather than viscerally felt. The resolution feels more like an elegant procedure than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are largely implicit and low: the “opposition” is urban noise and forgetfulness, and they never truly endanger Mara’s project. There is a mild deepening when commuters intrude, but no genuine threat to the exhibit, the locket, or Mara’s belief. Escalation is more a steady accumulation of affirmations (visitors leave gratitude notes) than a tightening that forces trade-offs. The ending with the child is sweet but risk-free, so pressure never sharpens into a real test.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is mostly internal and conceptual—Selene versus secrecy, fear, and the oppressive ocean—without much on-page resistance or escalation. The stakes (liberating vulnerability, teaching future seekers) are meaningful but stay abstract, and Selene never seriously risks failure. The key beats (opening the compartment, raising the lab) happen without friction or setback, which flattens tension. This reads more as a mythic vignette than a pressured narrative, limiting stakes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can locate and reclaim erased memories, particularly the whale’s song—is clear but faces little resistance. Once the coffee grounds form the spiral, every step (entering, exhuming, unlocking, collecting) proceeds without meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The gravity fluctuations are atmospheric rather than truly hazardous, and no alternative path is genuinely foreclosed. As a result, tension remains gentle and meditative, with escalation more in imagery than in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing a cosmic rupture by hushing the prophecy—is stated early and followed through, but the conflict is almost entirely one-sided. There’s no credible resistance: the ritual works as described, with no genuine threat, complication, or trade-off that narrows options. Pressure escalates in imagery (glyphs, lattice, tightening thread) rather than in risk or difficulty. As a result, the resolution feels procedurally earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict and stakes are the weakest axis: the only explicit obstacle is the forgotten sugar, which is trivial and quickly solved. The deeper stakes—risking self by entering a pact of lies with someone who speaks to stone—are gestured at rather than actively dramatized. Escalation is primarily atmospheric (the intensifying meteor shower, deepening intimacy), not pressure-based. The ending offers a meaningful reorientation but without having tested the protagonist’s resolve or forced a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can transform quarantined isolation into sustaining solitude—is clear but largely untested. There is minimal escalation; the garden’s deepening twilight and the shell’s successive verses feel like reiterations of the same pressure rather than tightening turns. The key “choice” (lifting the shell to merge with the dawn) is symbolically strong but faces no on-page alternative or risk, so it doesn’t convincingly foreclose another path. Tension remains mostly conceptual, not felt as real conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—whether and how to use forgery as a “calibrated treason” to heal the wound of her master’s unfinished work—is clear, and the discovery of the hidden script plus the decision to trace it onto the marble floor constitute a meaningful deepening. Pressure, however, remains gentle; there is little genuine risk or cost dramatized beyond conceptual guilt and legacy. The “weaponized vs balm” tension is invoked but never forces Liora into a concrete trade-off where harm to someone or something is clearly possible. As a result, the stakes feel resonant but muted, more contemplative than truly testing.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering why people echo and, secondarily, releasing them—is signaled early and resolved, but pressure remains largely abstract and gentle. Escalation is mostly a deepening of imagery (child’s laughter → lover’s farewell → lattice of lives) rather than a tightening of options or increase in cost. The suggested deadline (“before the dawn’s pale breath”) never materializes as a live constraint, and no antagonistic force or real resistance tests her commitment. The resolution is earned but feels almost entirely unopposed, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—releasing “pure essence” from the wreck and healing collective dreams—is clear but remains ethereal and largely uncontested. There is little sense of resistance or risk: the spirits do not actively push back, her attempts never fail or misfire, and solutions appear as linear realizations rather than pressured choices. The main tightening is the recognition that shards must be guided back via a final cameo, but this does not force a trade-off or visibly foreclose an option. As a result, escalation feels gentle and meditative rather than truly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—whether he can truly “appreciate hidden effort” beyond idle gazing—is signaled, but it never sharpens into a dilemma or trade-off. His act of whistling and using the whisk as a loom are framed as small rebellions, yet nothing substantial opposes or complicates them; the world is welcoming rather than resistant. The “return” on the second night and the fireflies’ “gratitude” deepen the idea but do not escalate pressure; the situation stays essentially the same in tone and stakes. As a result, the piece feels meditative rather than conflict-driven, suitable for lyric work but weak on narrative tension for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the cursed diamond and corporate lies—is clearly signaled and resolved. There is some escalation, especially in the night scene of reassembling the letters under intensifying dust storms, and a conceptual tightening when Mira realizes the stillpoint is a mental state. Yet concrete danger or difficult trade-offs are largely absent: the radiation never bites, the curse never tests her, and she succeeds without substantial setback or sacrifice. As a result, conflict feels mostly intellectual and thematic, with limited visceral pressure or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    The declared stakes—reconfiguring the allegiance of drifting tribes and forging a new dawn from shadows—are grand but remain largely abstract, with no real on-page resistance or hard trade-offs. The storm appears dangerous yet never truly threatens failure; every escalation (mirrors, coils, drones) works smoothly without setback. The visionary’s “rallying” of clans and the world’s eventual pledge are narrated as fait accompli rather than contested victories. As a result, tension is muted and the final sunrise feels more like the culmination of a ritual than the resolution of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the poet can turn his isolation and the dunes’ forgotten music into a bridge between generations—is present but under-pressured. There is almost no resistance: no external opposition, no real doubt or failure, just a steady fulfillment of his mission. The closest thing to escalation is the movement from solitary collecting to sharing jars with a child, which is affecting but arrives without a prior test or real risk. As a result, tension is low and the sense of price paid remains mostly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding the Heart of Echoes from misuse—is signaled early, and there is one clear tightening as Elara moves from surface calibration to the irrevocable act of unlocking and then reconfiguring the Heart’s output. Yet the conflict remains largely procedural and internal; nothing pushes back on her beyond the technical puzzle, and the threatened antagonists never appear. As a result, tension accrues more through atmosphere than through escalating opposition or painful trade-offs. The final choice to channel the Heart toward healing feels right but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transmute impatience into a durable patience—is clear but remains low-pressure and mostly internal. The main tightening beat is the moon’s apex, when the viaduct’s field surges and she risks attuning herself more deeply to this strange rhythm. However, there are few credible alternatives or losses on the page; her success feels likely and unopposed, with no real trade-off beyond relinquishing an abstract “restless yearning.” As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing future deaths by stabilizing hidden infrastructure—is stated early, but on-page pressure is mild. Mara encounters no significant resistance (physical, institutional, or emotional) as she gathers data, follows the pipe, and turns the valve; each step proceeds as expected. Internal conflict about data vs. fear-based systems is gestured at but never forces a hard trade-off or risky decision. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth progression of tasks than tightening conflict with real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to intervene in a potent symbol of repentance and what that means for redemption—is signaled but never pressured into a difficult trade-off. Once the chaplain decides to try, there is no real risk of failure or repercussion; the repair proceeds smoothly and succeeds on the first attempt. The shopkeeper’s corrective (fresh spring vs. gentle winding) is a mild deepening rather than a true tightening of stakes. As a result, tension stays gentle and reflective rather than escalating toward a genuinely costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—satisfying the algorithm’s yearning by ringing an unheard bell—is conceptually interesting but thinly pressured. There is no real resistance, risk, or sacrifice: Mara executes her plan with ease, and the outcome only opens more delightful possibility. The escalation reads more as increasing spectacle than tightening stakes, so conflict remains largely notional.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering the lost crew’s final messages and reconfiguring what “deleted” means—is present but largely intellectual, and practical resistance is minimal. Lia’s main tightening is her decision to lie with the tribute post, which successfully escalates pressure by provoking the system, but everything after that unfolds with little friction or risk. There’s no serious threat of failure, institutional opposition, or moral dilemma to force a costly choice. As a result, tension remains gentle and the arc satisfying but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the broken shard can be restored to guide and warm the world—is clear but remains conceptual and low-pressure; nothing truly opposes her beyond implied cold and memory. Escalation is minimal: once she recalls the method and finds the van, the ritual proceeds without setback, counterforce, or meaningful risk. The conflict is essentially “perform the known rite correctly,” with no on-page possibility that she might refuse, fail, or pay a nontrivial price. As a result, the climax glows but doesn’t feel like a hard-won narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator is moving toward self-annihilation or toward a different relation to endings—is established early but remains mostly internal and abstract. Pressure does accumulate mildly as she listens for the “sound of endings” through wreckage, storms, and stories, leading to a night climax with wind and volunteers at the buoy. However, there’s no concrete fork where she must forgo a path or pay a palpable price; the shift to acceptance feels like a gentle slide rather than a choice wrested from competing desires. As a result, tension is consistently low, even if thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether mismatched love and solitude can be transformed into a meaningful bond with the land—remains largely conceptual. The key “choice” is his decision to plant the charred scrap, but there’s little sense of what alternative he genuinely risks or forecloses, and almost no escalation beyond deepening metaphors. The vines “answer” and the letter glows without significant friction, so the piece avoids stasis but never develops strong tension or a felt price. As a result, the final harmony lands more as a gentle continuation than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and situational, with no significant opposition or risk beyond whether wisdom will be properly “preserved.” The prophet’s arrival is a clear inciting beat, and the act of consecration is a mild tightening, but nothing meaningfully threatens failure. Stakes remain abstract and spiritual; the story never dramatizes a concrete consequence for inattention or misalignment. As a result, pressure feels gentle and static, even if thematically consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are conceptually large—collective healing of a wounded town—but antagonistic pressure is almost entirely absent. Mara encounters no resistance, doubt, or meaningful risk that her method will fail; each step proceeds smoothly from setup to catharsis. Without a coercive force or a hard choice under pressure, escalation feels modest and the central stake never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially conceptual—whether Mara can “decode the pattern of growth” in language—signaled early but never put under real threat. Pressure does increase slightly as the crystal’s behavior shifts from resistance to chorus, culminating in her realization and later offering. Yet there is no genuine narrowing of options or visible trade-off; success feels granted rather than wrestled from resistance. The result is quietly pleasant but low-tension, keeping escalation in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully fix the sound/experience of aging in a world of fog and forgetting—is present from the start and revisited at the monolith and cassette beats. Escalation is mostly tonal and imagistic rather than situational: he moves deeper, the fog thickens, the resonance swells, and the driftwood lights, culminating in his inscription for future wanderers. There is no substantial obstacle to locating or using the chalk, so tension feels low-grade rather than sharply intensifying. The final stance is earned, but the pressure never quite tightens into a genuinely difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the sage can convert chaotic spin into stable purpose—is clear but expressed in highly abstract, low-risk terms. There is a mild escalation as the foundations keep shaking and he must wait for the precise leaf-sound to align gears and “escape velocity,” yet failure never feels like it would exact a tangible on-page price beyond disappointed purpose. His final act (tightening the screw, allowing the spin to power the telescope) resolves the external problem but without a sharp sense of foreclosed alternative. The conflict reads more like a meditative technical ritual than a pressured crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—Mara guiding Harlan through a peaceful, “flawless” goodbye—is clear but almost entirely uncontested. There is no friction from Harlan, the staff, or Mara’s own doubts; the blood work has already settled the medical outcome, and the ritual unfolds without resistance or complication. As a result, the piece lacks meaningful escalation: the harp-playing deepens mood but doesn’t narrow options or force a visible trade-off. The cost (death and parting) is inherent to the premise rather than sharpened by on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—solving where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and answered at the end, but there is little genuine pressure or risk attached to failure beyond intellectual frustration. Escalation is mostly a matter of increasingly spectacular revelations (doorway, chamber, map) rather than tightened options or costs, and everything works the first time. Lira’s agency is present but never really tested, so the conflict feels primarily procedural, not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can reconcile skepticism and belief by repairing the substitute body and, metaphorically, her worldview—is present but remains largely internal and under-tested. There is a mild tightening as she moves from doubt to placing the tooth and feeling “cold certainty,” yet there’s no genuine resistance, risk of failure, or meaningful trade-off. The bone-setting proceeds smoothly, and the garden seems entirely cooperative, so tension never really spikes. As a result, the resolution is earned enough for a quiet piece but lacks the sharper cost or narrowing of options expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very low-grade: she wants to instantiate a non-destructive light and does so without real obstruction. The dominant stake—creating a flame-less illumination—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened or complicated. There is a mild escalation as she moves from intention to completed spiral, but no moment where she must trade off or risk loss. As a result, the ending feels serene rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming viral pain into a gentler, integrated meaning—is clear, and Lira’s key actions (placing stones, offering the pendant, engaging the interface) track that desire. However, pressure is low: nothing concretely resists her, and the garden and machinery respond almost immediately, so there’s little sense of risk, sacrifice, or possible failure. The main deepening beat is discovering and activating the dormant interface, which works but doesn’t strongly narrow options or present a trade-off. As a result, the story is moving but mild in tension, more meditative than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she should bind others’ hopes into her prose—is present but remains largely philosophical. The only real tightening is her doubt (“perhaps the hopes were not hers to bind”) versus the nexus urging her onward, but this never sharpens into a dilemma with tangible consequence if she refuses. The narrative river/current idea hints at a choice to go upstream, yet the world offers no serious resistance beyond metaphor. As a result, tension is gentle and static rather than escalating toward the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving the valley’s sacred practices—is clear, and there is a mild ticking clock tied to the harvest moon’s rise. However, opposition and risk are soft: there’s little sense that Mara might fail or that something meaningful could go wrong if she misplays the rite. Escalation is largely environmental (moon rising, vines responding) rather than driven by increasingly costly decisions. The resolution feels gently foregone rather than hard-won, which limits tension even in a lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure here is almost entirely internal and tonal; the ritual succeeds without resistance, setback, or credible risk of failure. The dominant stake—can she seal and tend these luminous maps as a living covenant—never faces a concrete, narrowing test. The one deepening is the recognition that the seal holds only with ongoing care, but that realization doesn’t force a hard trade-off in scene. The result is lovely but low-tension, which limits conflict and stakes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are the weakest axis: nothing on the page meaningfully resists Corin, and each step toward repairing the timer proceeds without setback or genuine risk. The dominant stake—capturing and preserving wonder—is largely abstract and never tested by a threat of loss or failure; the device shivers and hums on first attempt with no price demanded. There is some sense of investment of time and patience, and a mild deepening as he refines the method, but no real escalation or trade-off is dramatized. As a result, the ending feels more like a completed procedure than an earned resolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—liberating the grotto’s “boundary-lessly trapped sorrow” by balancing burdens—is clear but remains abstract and low-pressure. The only stated constraint, that the flame can absorb a weight only when the air is perfectly still, never actually threatens the process; nothing seriously complicates or endangers her goal. The ritual deepens (more statues, final alignment) but doesn’t truly escalate, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond “she finishes her work.” As a result, the piece is beautiful and coherent, yet dramatically mild.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain trapped in grief or reshape it into something usable—is clear, and the act of carving/containing grief marks a genuine internal turn. However, pressure never meaningfully tightens: there is no real sense that her project might fail, that the alchemical process could cost her something irreplaceable, or that she might choose to keep clinging to the roar. Conflict stays largely contemplative and harmonious, with little friction between want and fear, so the final stance feels more like a graceful continuation than a hard-won trade-off. This keeps tension modest, even though the resolution is thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can meaningfully renegotiate her relationship with regret and her younger self—appears early and remains in focus. Pressure does build as she gathers more stories and the ghost grows heavier, leading to the concrete negotiation and trade of stories for a single unbroken memory. However, escalation is mostly emotional and symbolic, with limited sense that refusal or failure would change her options in a sharply different way; conflict resolves fairly smoothly once she offers the bargain. The cost is present but could be sharpened by a clearer live alternative or more acute internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can bring the terminal back to life as a vessel for renewed hope—is clear but under-pressured. Once she starts rerouting flows, nothing truly resists her: there are no meaningful setbacks, trade-offs, or moral costs to her choices. The ethical angle (“navigating the ethical currents of reclaimed technology”) is stated but never actually forces a difficult decision. As a result, conflict feels conceptual rather than lived, and tension stays low.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will continue to treat the memory-clock as a shameful burden or accept it—is present but under-pressured. He arrives already leaning toward reconciliation, and the process of inscribing numerals proceeds without real friction, opposition, or reversal. The main “tightening” is largely tonal (crystal’s response, sanctuary’s hum) rather than a turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off. As a result, the ending feels emotionally satisfying but somewhat preordained and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—salvaging truth from a city built on lies—is largely conceptual and remains abstract on the page. Externally, the only concrete obstacle is the rusted lock, which yields relatively easily once the sundial is applied, so pressure never tightens into a genuine test. Internally, there’s little real doubt or risk; his purpose clarifies without facing a meaningful trade-off or visible loss. As a result, escalation feels gentle and meditative rather than truly charged.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared (preserving ancient methods before “modern tides” erase them), but no real resistance—internal or external—ever materializes; everything he attempts works on the first try. The decoding and ritual never threaten to fail, and his patience is affirmed rather than tested, so tension remains low and largely atmospheric. The only “tightening” is conceptual, when the master weaver’s mark appears, but it doesn’t force a trade-off or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is existential—can he transform unmarked absences into a map of healing without being swallowed by solitude—and it does deepen as the garden responds and the rose revives. Still, there is minimal overt opposition, no true reversal, and little sense that any option is foreclosed; his path feels ordained rather than wrestled into. The tension remains low-grade and textural, limiting escalation under an elite-venue bar.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty/life can be restored within a mechanized, flawed world—is stated early and paid off conceptually at the end. Yet conflict is almost entirely internal and largely asserted; there is no real opposition to his plan, no jeopardy for the egg, and no risk that his attempt will fail beyond implication. The assembly of the cradle proceeds frictionlessly, and the hatching arrives as a reward rather than an earned victory under pressure. As a result, escalation is gentle and textural rather than genuinely tightening, which keeps the stakes from feeling urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (transforming a destructive legacy into healing) are meaningful but remain largely abstract and uncontested on the page. There is no real threat the ritual will fail; the coin sings on first attempt, villagers are already in a posture of gratitude by the time they appear, and no opposing force or doubt complicates her plan. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than circumstantially, so we don’t see options foreclosed or a genuine trade-off forced. The result is a beautiful mood piece with limited tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—liberating the city’s trapped memories—is clear, and there is a modest tightening when the box resists (“hinges tightening as if bound by an ancient reluctance”). However, there is little genuine escalation: Mara never faces a hard trade-off, credible risk of failure, or loss that alters tactics, and the opposition remains abstract and easily overcome by “sidereal patience.” Internal and external conflicts do not meaningfully interlock to force a tough choice. The result is gently engaging but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transmit guiding light without resorting to destructive fire—is present and does deepen as the sonar exposes “shadows of forgotten wars.” However, pressure remains mostly meditative; there’s no true narrowing of options or felt risk that her vow might fail or cost her something personal beyond inherited sorrow. The main escalation lies in the increasing reach and resonance of the sonar and the revelation that the gear’s infinity is a bridge, which is conceptually satisfying but low-tension. The final act of burying the gear reads as a calm consecration more than a hard, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Eliam learning to shape collective grief into meaningful monuments—is clear, but conflict remains largely abstract and unopposed. Escalation is mostly a deepening of pattern (more butterflies, more ribbon, expanded spiral) rather than pressure that narrows options or forces a painful trade-off. The key “turn” is the final heart-form and monument carve, which arrives smoothly rather than under duress. This works for a meditative piece but limits tension and emotional bite.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining or restoring shared balance between humanity and tide/time—is clear but largely abstract. Pressure technically escalates from a rare, silent pendulum pause to the awakening bob and global rebalancing image, yet Mara meets no resistance and never risks losing anything substantial. Each subsequent “pause” is framed as opportunity rather than threat, so tension plateaus. The result is a beautifully rendered ritual with low dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the “shape of intentions” in the whispers of the dead—is clear but remains almost entirely conceptual. There is one real tightening when the tapestry yields Marlowe’s misread intentions and the healing spring map, but nothing pushes back against the gardener: no risk of failure, no moral quandary, no trade-off beyond quiet effort. The ritual proceeds smoothly from start to insight, so tension stays low and there’s little sense of price paid. This keeps the piece from feeling dramatically necessary, even if it is thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stakes—looming famine and the kingdom’s survival—are high, but on-page conflict is relatively frictionless. The model works on the first try, the kingdom’s scholars agree to test it after brief skepticism, and the plan succeeds without reversal or visible sacrifice. Escalation exists conceptually (forecasted threats, execution of a new plan) but lacks a concrete beat where options narrow and a costly decision is faced in scene. The result is more illustrative parable than pressurized narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving a story-famished city through forbidden music—is clear, and the pirate broadcast is a meaningful new pressure. Yet once the signal appears, everything important comes easily: Mara transcribes, the crowd gathers, the song plays, and the city rejoices without pushback or real jeopardy. The one “tightening” is Mara deciding to act as conduit, but that decision is not framed as risky or costly. Conflict thus feels conceptual rather than tense, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual—preserving a “fleeting emotion” and confronting the illusion of safety—without much sense of risk, failure, or genuine opposition. The pressure does intensify slightly as the gallery “awaits her answer” and the air thickens, but she’s never forced into a hard trade-off or apparent danger. As a result, the ritual feels preordained rather than contested, and escalation is more tonal than consequential. The ending registers as a meaningful stance shift, but not a hard-won one.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—how the city’s past and its technologies will be remembered—is clear, but the conflict remains mostly abstract. The promised “agonizing” rarely manifests as concrete pressure or real risk; no relationship, material constraint, or social consequence ever sharpens the choice. The turn from either/or to both/and is interesting but comes easily, without a visible price or trade-off beyond a change in mindset. As a result, escalation is modest and tension never quite deepens into urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether art and harmony can survive in a community marked by old grudges—are well signaled early. Yet the conflict is almost entirely one-sided: the townspeople bring “hatred” and “old grudges,” but there is no concrete resistance, misstep, or test of her method on the page. The shift from tension to release happens smoothly after the first chord with no significant setback or dilemma, so escalation is more implied than dramatized. The price paid (ongoing, fragile work) is conceptually present but under-embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can midwife a new, listening-consciousness from ruins—is clear but remains largely abstract and unthreatened. Pressure rises somewhat with the beginning of the alignment and the risky act of placing the seed into the memory-laden broth, with the seed’s shimmer and the plants’ hum implying uncertainty. However, no options are truly foreclosed; no alternative failure state is dramatized, and everything proceeds according to hope and rumor. As a result, the “gentle rebellion” feels conceptually potent but dramatically low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder/chorus after the hive failure—is signaled, but the story offers little genuine resistance or sacrifice. The riddle opens simply by being read aloud; the key fits and works without complication; the drone appears as a gift rather than something earned under pressure. There is a conceptual tightening once the echo is understood, but no credible test of Mara’s resolve or a trade-off that forecloses another path. As a result, tension remains low and escalation feels largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure here is almost entirely internal and thematic, centered on whether silence becomes a “tool rather than a trap” and what the narrator’s noticing amounts to. The acquisition and deployment of the shard do create a mild escalation, particularly when the hush radiates and the houses respond. However, there’s no real resistance, dilemma, or loss—every development is gently positive—so options never feel meaningfully narrowed. The result is a lovely mood piece with limited tension rather than a story with robust stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is largely absent; there is no resisting force, no risk that the garden will reject nuance, and no alternative outcome that feels live. Each step—the threading, revelations, repairs—succeeds without complication or sacrifice, so stakes remain abstractly philosophical rather than pressured. The “structural weakness” is used as a conduit, not as a genuine danger. As a result, escalation is more a gentle deepening of imagery than a tightening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—proving perpetual motion via the staircase and resolving the chipped die’s refusal—are clear, and we do get a meaningful tightening when the staircase begins to respond and “quiver,” confirming his risky premise. Conflict is primarily internal/conceptual; there’s little external opposition or concrete jeopardy, so tension rides on whether his system can tolerate the permanent flaw and what that means to him. The final turn (the chipped side finally landing face up and being thematically reinterpreted) works, but his agency under pressure is understated and largely summarized. As a result, escalation feels thoughtful rather than gripping, limiting the stakes’ felt intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure remains mostly static: Mara wants to rouse strangers through kindness, and nothing on the page seriously endangers or complicates that aim. The only real tightening is temporal—night giving way to smoggy dawn—and Jiro’s arrival feels like a gentle payoff rather than a test of her resolve. There’s no real antagonistic force or felt risk; she never has to consider stopping, hiding, or altering her approach. As a result, the stakes stay abstract and the conflict never truly escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving endangered arts among displaced refugees—is clear but only lightly pressured. Once Liora decides to revive the bread custom, the artisans thaw with minimal friction, and the lens’ magic solves problems smoothly; there’s no real test of her commitment or visible sacrifice. Escalation is more a steady brightening of imagery than a narrowing of options or sharpening of risk. As a result, the resolution feels aesthetically satisfying but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—mastering the lighthouse to step beyond fate—is articulated, but conflict remains largely abstract and goes mostly unopposed. The island’s “mute warning” and the “relentless tide” never crystallize into tangible risk, and the mechanism yields without meaningful failure or sacrifice. The hunger stone’s dimming is the only hint of cost, and it’s treated more as a graceful fade than a hard price. Tension exists in concept but doesn’t truly escalate on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Mara can coerce fear into revealing its weakness without being consumed by the curse—tightens in a clear arc from entering the funhouse to the ritual on the horse to confronting the hunched fear-figure. Escalation is present (mirrors whispering, horse dissolving, shadows screaming), and the exposure/dissolution of fear is a meaningful turn driven by her actions. However, the personal and relational costs (especially in relation to her brother and her own future) remain abstract, and the final bargain is posed rather than actively chosen on the page. The pressure is more conceptual than viscerally felt, limiting the sense of a hard-won, painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is almost entirely absent: there is a goal, but no real resistance or risk of failure, and the orchard’s transformation proceeds smoothly. The “stake” (proving obstacles can be instruments) is never meaningfully tested or threatened; the universe is already fully cooperative with his belief. As a result, pressure does not truly tighten, and the final cadence feels like a graceful culmination rather than a hard-won or costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—Shellhaven avoiding fossilization and reconnecting with the wider world—are conceptually high and articulated early via the rusted gate and legend of the lost expedition. However, on-page pressure is gentle: each step (discovering the mosaic, opening the passage, contacting the watchers) unfolds with minimal friction or risk. There’s one meaningful deepening at contact, when the watchers’ light-language reframes the expedition and her purpose, but no hard trade-off or visible loss. The result is thematically rich but relatively low-tension in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—is signaled, but opposition is largely conceptual and never truly bites. There’s no real resistance: the mailbox opens with a simple tool, the letter offers its contents, and the environment yields once the letter is read. Internal conflict about the value of noble lies is mentioned in backstory, yet Arlen never has to choose between preserving a lie and exposing a costly truth. As a result, tension stays abstract and escalation is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing memory from oblivion—is clear but remains mostly conceptual, with limited on-page jeopardy or narrowing of options. There is mild escalation as she moves from water’s edge into the cold, mossy interior and presses the final note beside the winged horse, then commits to return. However, nothing seriously resists her beyond environment; there’s no moment where she might turn back or meaningfully alter tactics. The result is a beautifully sustained mood with only modest tension.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and safeguarding the city’s true origins—is articulated, but the on-page pressure is low. Mara never faces a genuine reversal: her hypothesis is correct, the council is immediately cooperative, the vault yields its secrets without resistance. Escalation is mostly informational rather than adversarial or costly, so tension never truly tightens. As a result, the final victory is conceptually satisfying but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully transform his grief through this ritual—is clear, but escalation is largely linear and predictable: record, polish, fold, release. The main tightening comes with the basilica quivering and the final crane’s completion, yet there is no real test or threat that his effort might fail or cost him something unexpected. Internal and external conflict are closely aligned but remain relatively static; he is never forced into a wrenching trade-off. The ending lands, but the path there lacks a strong sense of narrowing options or raised cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—what he does with his grief and his access to latent potential—is clear, but largely internal and philosophical. There is one main tightening beat (the seam revealed and recognized as a reservoir), after which his path to merger is almost frictionless; nothing credible opposes him beyond a brief mention of dread. The choice has implied cost (abandoning a prior way of relating to loss) but that cost isn’t sharply dramatized, and no alternative path is actively foreclosed on the page. Tension exists, yet it never quite bites hard enough for top-tier conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are largely conceptual (“frequency of belonging”) and never face material or emotional opposition on the page. The main “tightening” is the approach to the pedestal and the chip’s activation, but nothing significant threatens failure or forces Lira to trade one value for another. Conflict is essentially ritual fulfillment rather than struggle, so tension remains low and steady. This limits how impactful the climax can feel, despite the pretty imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core stake—whether he will finally face and correct a withheld truth that underpins his fraudulent trade—is clear but under-pressured. Once he accepts the commission, there’s no serious resistance, complication, or alternative path; the sea and shore are evocative but not antagonistic. The carvings yield their message on first attempt, and the client’s stakes never actually test him. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady approach to a foregone realization than a tightening that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are notionally high (lives and freedom), but on‑page pressure never fully tightens; the opposing negotiator offers little real resistance and agreement comes quickly. Internal conflict—fear driven by the protagonist’s past failure—appears but doesn’t seriously threaten his chosen course of action. There is one clear deepening when he recalls the disastrous prior exchange and consciously decides to “recycle mistakes into wisdom,” yet the decision faces no substantive test. As a result, the resolution feels relatively low-cost for the scale of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will be paralyzed by betrayal/regret or move forward in spite of it—is clear but faces minimal on-page resistance. Once he chooses to launch the kayak, nothing in the present truly tests or threatens that commitment; pressure accrues mostly through reiterated interior summaries instead of escalated dilemmas or trade-offs. The key turn is conceptual rather than situational: reinterpreting “backlash of regrets” as a tide to ride, which deepens but doesn’t significantly tighten external options. As a result, conflict feels gentle and mostly contemplative rather than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can genuinely kindle empathy and reconfigure their relationship to a dirty past—is signaled, but pressure around it is soft. The journey unfolds with minimal resistance: the crate is simply found, the tunnel chosen by a gentle lure, the mirror’s lesson accepted without much struggle. The main “tightening” is the internal realization upon seeing the empathetic self, which is conceptually strong but not strongly opposed or tested. As a result, the final sacrifice of the baseball carries symbolic weight but little sense of cost or risk beyond introspective discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central stake—whether Liora will surrender part of her human form to reunite with Arion—is clearly articulated. Yet the conflict is largely static: she dreads the metamorphosis but proceeds without hesitation, and no external or internal reversal tests her resolve. Once the ritual begins, there is no real doubt or escalation; the stag appears and the bond reforges without resistance or visible tradeoff beyond aesthetic bark patterns. The result is a beautiful but low-tension progression rather than a sharpened crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving lost time to soothe the sky-borne twins and address unborn grief—is present but remains abstract and low-friction. Once the clasp is unfastened, each subsequent step unfolds without genuine resistance or uncertainty; there’s no moment where the ritual seems likely to fail or demand a painful trade-off. Internal conflict (her own grief) is asserted but not tested through hard choices; letting go feels narratively inevitable. As a result, escalation reads more as a graceful ascent through set pieces than as mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension by stitching grief into something new—is clear, and there is a gentle escalation as the veil tightens, shadows recede, and the seam finally “cracks like a sunrise.” However, opposition is largely abstract (“cold pressure on her back,” reluctant shadows) and remains more atmospheric than adversarial, so Nara’s commitment is never severely tested. Her success never feels genuinely at risk, and no meaningful alternative path is dramatized or foreclosed. The result is resonant but low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to reconcile her exhaustion with her belief in purposeful transformation, but this remains largely internal and low-tension. Escalation is gentle: jar trembles → sparks transform the sand → fisherman brings prophecy into focus, without any moment where she must trade one value against another or risk real loss. Coincidence (fisherman’s appearance and ancestral lore) effectively resolves ambiguity rather than complicating it, softening pressure. The final decision to walk back to the village with renewed purpose feels more like affirmation than a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—a subversive, bloodless revolution—is compelling on paper, but on the page it unfolds without resistance, sacrifice, or risk of failure. Kael never has to choose between competing goods, alter tactics under duress, or pay a visible price; he simply executes a clever plan. The “escalation” is primarily a build in imagery and scope (from sundial to cradle to garrison reaction), not a tightening of pressure. As a result, the resolution feels graceful but under-tested, more like a successful demonstration than a conflict-driven climax.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict and stakes are largely internal and conceptual—can she reframe and wield her curse, and can cosmic patterns be coaxed rather than obeyed. There is one primary escalation: the act of placing the final red stone, triggering the flame and confirming or refuting her belief, which narrows her existential options. However, her fear of an “endless loop” of failed futures never encounters a concrete on-page test, so pressure feels fairly gentle and assured rather than genuinely risky. The piece is satisfying on a lyric level, but the lack of a sharp trade-off or visible loss keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict and stakes stay highly abstract: the risk is essentially whether the poet’s ritual can meaningfully “rarefy” collective wounds, but there is little sense of what failure would look or feel like. The timer provides a minimal ticking-clock escalation, yet the poet never faces a live alternative or sacrifice once the ritual begins. The storm’s softening and the legend of the envelope occur without any real contest or resistance. As a result, tension is more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is more ceremonial than pressured: the duel’s outcome is framed as a shared destination almost from the outset, and no real risk or sacrifice is dramatized. Escalation consists mostly of increasingly ornate descriptions of their fencing rather than narrowing options or heightening cost. The philosopher’s “victory” is immediately mutualized and untroubling, so no path feels truly foreclosed. As a result, the stakes stay abstract, and tension never quite tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes—rebuilding a shattered world via a blooming resistance—are declared as immense, but on-page conflict is almost entirely frictionless. The guard hands over the tin, the manifesto is read, the rebuilding proceeds, seeds are planted, travelers arrive: no serious opposition, setback, or hard trade-off challenges their aim. The main “pressure” is conceptual rather than situational, so escalation reads as a steady accumulation of luminous images, not tightening risk or cost. As a result, the rebellion feels inevitable rather than actively won.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether he can pull off an encore that “rewrites every schedule” before night—exists but is mostly abstract. There is a mild escalation (approaching night, compasses brightening then dimming, tide of clouds pressing the arbor) and a tactical choice to use hidden reel segments to escape. However, resistance is largely atmospheric; we never feel a sharp narrowing of options or a painful trade-off. The conflict remains contemplative rather than tense, which keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—awakening the seed before the monsoon to preserve collective memory—is clearly stated, but the pressure around it remains mostly abstract. The main escalation is internal (fear the seed will sprout too late) rather than situational; Mara does the required steps once and succeeds, with no reversal or significant narrowing of options. Her micro-choices in interpreting symbols and uttering the incantation are present but not framed as risky trade-offs. As a result, tension is gentle and lyrical rather than gripping, which is effective but below top-tier for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the island’s accumulated regret can be released—is clear but the pressure on that stake barely escalates. Once the ritual starts, the compass responds without real resistance; there’s no moment where failure feels possible or where the tutor must choose between competing goods. The ritual’s knots and instructions deepen the mood but don’t meaningfully narrow options or exact a price. As a result, tension is gentle and static rather than tightening, which limits impact for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.9)
    The central conflict is purely atmospheric—man versus the void—but lacks a moment of failure, doubt, or sacrifice. The protagonist overcomes the "endless night" via a magical breath without facing a difficult choice or trade-off, rendering the stakes abstract and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no opposition and pays no price for its discovery. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("where thoughts come from") without landing in a concrete, dramatized risk or loss on the page. The climax is a procedural execution rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no genuine conflict; the "mistrust" is stated as a premise but never demonstrated through on-page opposition or specific incidents. The resolution is achieved through a magical device that works perfectly on the first try, bypassing any need for escalation, tactical shifting, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition from the environment, the marbles, or himself. The "deception" mentioned is never dramatized or explained, making the "mending" feel unearned. The narrative escalates only in abstract affirmation, lacking the tension of potential failure or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story lacks conflict entirely; there is no antagonist, no scarcity, and no risk of failure. The stakes are purely abstract ("prove time moves sideways") and are resolved without the protagonist facing a dilemma or making a trade-off. The tension line is flat from inciting incident to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment cooperates, the code unravels itself, and the ghost is benevolent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are purely internal and relatively low-pressure; the wind is ambient rather than antagonistic. The escalation is ritualistic—she performs actions and the machine responds—lacking a moment of difficult choice or risk that would heighten the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal and abstract; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma other than a vague "lingering danger." The stakes are described as "emotional tonnage," which keeps the pressure theoretical rather than visceral or immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment accommodates the protagonist's desires immediately ("floor softened," "vines retracting"). The stakes are abstract ("broken thoughts") and are resolved by a magical location without the protagonist having to exert agency, sacrifice anything, or overcome resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no resistance from the audience, the elements, or her own limitations. The stakes ("link the listeners") are resolved instantly and perfectly by the music, resulting in a narrative with no tightening or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract; there is no penalty for failure and no active opposition or time pressure preventing the goal. The historian faces no difficult trade-offs, making the escalation feel like a procedural checklist rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks a functional conflict or antagonist; the protagonist moves from idea to execution to total success without facing obstacles or paying a cost. There is no escalation of stakes, only a sequence of events that unfolds exactly as planned. The "quiet revolution" happens entirely off-page and without jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stakes ("possession," "shackling the city") remain abstract and theoretical; the protagonist faces no active opposition or setbacks. The "ticking clock" is mentioned but does not force a change in tactics or a difficult trade-off. The resolution comes too easily, devoid of the necessary escalation to prove the threat's validity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are nominal; the "upended hush" offers no active opposition, and the threat of exhaustion is stated but not dramatized. The protagonist faces no trade-offs or genuine peril, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where success is granted rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is strictly internal and resolved through realization rather than action, with no antagonist or time pressure to force a hard choice. The "darkening brightness" serves as a mood cue rather than a source of escalating tension.

The stakes are theoretical ("emotional numbness") and are resolved without the protagonist having to sacrifice anything or make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist ("rogue quarantine") is off-screen and abstract. There is no on-page opposition or escalation; Elara enters the courtyard, finds the object, and dispatches it without facing a hurdle or paying a price. The "layered tranquility" removes tension rather than contrasting with it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and resolved through passive observation rather than active struggle. The stakes are philosophical; the "cost" is a moment of weeping, which feels like a guaranteed outcome of the premise rather than a hard-won price.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is rhetorical rather than dramatic; the "impossible choices" lack tangible consequences or context (e.g., who is he trading the rope with?). The stakes are declared in abstract terms ("unravel the very rope that bound his own story") rather than felt through visible risks or costs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or active opposition; the "chronic hush" is a passive obstacle that yields instantly to the protagonist's music. The story lacks a moment of doubt or a "tightening" beat where the outcome is in question, leading to a complete absence of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=1.8)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the leaf’s "reluctance" is a passive state that yields immediately to Marlowe’s intervention. There is no antagonist, no obstacle that requires a sacrifice or change in tactics, and no moment where the outcome is in doubt. The storm provides atmospheric noise but fails to exert narrative pressure or force a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are theoretically high (water survival) but practically low, as the solution is provided by a magical coincidence rather than character struggle. The central "exchange"—giving up past art—lacks on-page weight because the mechanism of loss is vague and the consequence is immediately mitigated by her ability to paint the convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the pilgrim asks for help and receives it immediately without obstacle, risk, or trade-off. The stakes remain abstract and theoretical ("amplify everyday magic") because they are never tested by failure or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the community and environment cooperate instantly with the archivist's desires. There is no escalation of stakes; the transition from collecting fragments to the final journey happens without a forcing mechanism or dilemma.

    There is a near-total absence of conflict or opposition; the environment cooperates perfectly with the protagonist's desires. Stakes remain abstract ("unspoken truths") with no immediate consequence for failure established on the page. The narrative lacks escalation, proceeding smoothly from one discovery to the next without increasing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain purely philosophical and abstract ("goodbye to his former emptiness") with no felt cost on the page.

There is no escalation of risk; the door opens easily and the answer is given freely.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is entirely abstract and located off-page (bureaucracy in a distant country); there is no immediate antagonist or obstacle in the prep room. The tension is atmospheric ("mourners whispered") rather than causal, resulting in a low-stakes ritual where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; no obstacle, antagonist, or internal flaw obstructs the stationer’s goal. The stakes are theoretical ("silence") rather than felt or immediate. Escalation is merely the passage of time (dawn arriving) rather than a narrowing of options or an intensification of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is virtually absent. The label’s "promise of death" is a false stake that dissolves immediately upon use, revealing itself as a harmless magic viewer. There is no antagonist, no ticking clock (tides are cyclical, not urgent), and no moment where the protagonist must risk something of value to achieve their goal.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=1.8)
    There is no antagonist, internal barrier, or escalating risk; the environment and objects actively aid the protagonist at every step. Stakes remain purely theoretical ("universal riddle"), resulting in a flat narrative trajectory devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks visceral stakes; the opposition (investors) is defeated instantly by a mural without any on-page struggle or counter-move. The resolution feels unearned because the "tightrope" Mira supposedly walks is never pulled taut in a specific moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and strictly thematic; there is no on-page pressure or tightening of options. The "mission" proceeds exactly as planned without risk of failure, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of genuine dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the "crack" is fixed instantly with no resistance, trade-off, or failure risk. The ship's departure provides ambient noise but exerts no actual pressure on the protagonist's choices or pace.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are abstract and devoid of immediate pressure; the "quiet dread" is asserted rather than felt through opposition or time constraints. There is no visible cost to Mara's actions; she observes a signal and performs a task without facing a dilemma or potential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the ruins offer no resistance, the magic works instantly, and the workers obey immediately. The protagonist faces no opposition, risks nothing, and pays no price for the restoration. The stakes are declared but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    The sacrifice of the distress signal is a legible cost, but the tension dissolves instantly via the "gathered hush" deus ex machina. The conflict between panic and purpose is smoothed over by the magic scent rather than earned through decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no antagonist, resistance, or escalation; the narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions. The climax lacks tension as the protagonist faces no risk of failure and pays no price for his success.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is retrospective and internal, lacking an immediate antagonist or obstacle in the present moment. The narrative lacks escalation; the resolution (fading away) happens because the summary says it is time, not because of a decisive, high-stakes choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are declared but never felt; the opposition is abstract until the very end, where it instantly capitulates without a struggle. There is no escalation of pressure; the weaver's method works immediately and perfectly, removing any sense of risk or trade-off necessary for genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=2.1)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment, which should be threatening (scholars vanished), yields instantly to Mara’s presence. The stakes ("lost faith") remain abstract and are resolved through a mechanical process of object placement rather than struggle or trade-off. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening point where failure becomes a possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent, as the protagonist encounters no opposition—internal, external, or environmental—while performing the ritual. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("hope," "meaning") that are never concretely threatened, resulting in a flat narrative arc without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are abstract and external; the coup exists as a distant context rather than an immediate pressure in the room. The protagonist faces no opposition or time-critical trade-offs on the page, resulting in a lack of escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful opposition or escalation; the spirits, the setting, and the magic object all conspire to ensure the protagonist's success. The "moment before deciding" implies a choice, but on the page, the character faces no dilemma and makes no trade-offs. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is no conflict; the subject (child) is sedated, and the protagonist performs her task without opposition, error, or trade-off. The story lacks escalation, as the "pressure" is merely the deepening of the twilight and the onset of anesthesia, requiring no agency or risk from the translator.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is no functioning conflict; the fog presents no active opposition, and the mural is completed without technical failure, social resistance, or personal sacrifice. The story lacks escalation, proceeding in a linear line of uncomplicated success from start to finish. Stakes are declared abstractly ("illuminating hearts") but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the garden is "eager," and Lena answers "instinctively" with a smile. The central stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—remains an abstract concept stated in the text rather than a felt dilemma with opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=2.8)
    The declared high stakes (tax on thoughts) exert no immediate pressure on the scene (e.g., no inspector, no headache). The potential conflict with Dr. Mirabel dissolves instantly upon her entry, deflating tension rather than escalating it toward a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist wants to heal the world and is immediately given the tool (postcard) and success (blooming) to do so. The stakes are telescopic—global healing—without a concrete, scene-level test or antagonist. There is no escalation of pressure, only an accumulation of imagery leading to a frictionless victory.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or difficult trade-offs in her preservation work. The traveler’s arrival offers a potential pressure point, but the interaction is smooth and transactional, devoid of the tension or high stakes required to drive a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=2.7)
    Conflict is nominal; declared stakes ("fragile bridges," "time pressed") never materialize into on-page opposition or difficult trade-offs. The protagonist succeeds at every step without struggle, resulting in a lack of narrative pressure or meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=2.7)
    The central conflict—preservation versus progress—is declared but never dramatized through genuine opposition or struggle. The resolution arrives without escalation; Mira simply performs a ritual, and the opposition immediately "trembles into silence." There is no back-and-forth struggle, no moment of doubt, and no trade-off made to achieve harmony. The stakes feel abstract because the solution is effortless and magical.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("echo of lost songs") with no concrete obstacles or opposition. Success is immediate and linear; there is no escalation of pressure, and the "fragile trust" mentioned is never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no active opposition; the maze welcomes him, the panels open upon touch, and the code is understood instantly. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or escalation of risk, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory. The "wind" and "distance" are abstract concepts rather than active antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no tangible conflict; the environment and "lingering spirits" offer zero opposition to Aria's intrusion. The stakes remain abstract ("rhythm of belonging") and are never threatened, resulting in a narrative with no escalation or tension. The climax is a moment of purely additive magic without a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or escalation; Maren moves from one success to the next without failure, setback, or risk. The "disappearing paths" present a condition rather than an active opposition, and the resolution requires no sacrifice or painful decision. The stakes are abstract ("recollection") and never tested by a concrete threat of loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=2.8)
    There are no functional stakes or opposition; the audience approves, the elements cooperate, and the child reinforces the illusion. The protagonist faces no risk of failure or meaningful cost, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the "monotony" he claims to fight is never dramatized as a genuine threat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical; Lira faces no antagonist, time limit, or internal barrier that threatens failure. The "tightening" phase ("learn to fledge") is resolved immediately through observation, lacking the "visible or felt price" required for higher bands. The conflict is purely aesthetic, devoid of the tension needed to drive a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "unsettled" state meets no resistance from the environment, other characters, or the protagonist's own flaws. There is no escalation or tightening of options, merely a progression of sunlight and ripples that resolves the "stakes" by fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no effective antagonist or obstacle; the "story famine" is a backstory condition, not an active pressure in the scene.

    The story lacks active opposition or rising stakes; the "resistance" is entirely abstract ("old thought patterns," "ruins") and yields instantly to Mara's actions. The celestial alignment provides a clock but not pressure, resulting in a scene that feels like a demonstration of ability rather than a conflict with the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is purely cerebral, pitting a man against an abstract concept ("boundless confinement") with no external opposition or tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    There is a basic escalation sequence (mirror to horse to monster), but the conflict is resolved too easily by the protagonist simply whispering a word. The stakes, while declared high ("unbosom the carnival's heart"), lack visceral weight because the cost of failure is never concretely dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are nonexistent; "obstacles" like gnarled branches are mentioned but offer no resistance, instantly converting to instruments. There is no escalation, difficult choice, or danger, resulting in a tension-free vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is nominal; obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (she looks for a pattern and finds it; she blows a whistle and receives an answer). There is no escalation of risk or cost, leading to a low-tension narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no tangible stakes; the conflict is entirely abstract ("truth" vs. "lies") with no penalty for failure. The protagonist faces no opposition or difficult choices, leading to a flat narrative arc devoid of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract (memory vs. oblivion) with no external pressure or obstacle to test Mara's resolve. The stakes are declared rather than demonstrated; there is no moment where she almost fails or must sacrifice something tangible to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are declared but never felt, as obstacles evaporate immediately upon encountering the protagonist (e.g., the council instantly agrees to funding). There is no escalation or pressure; Mara moves from hypothesis to proof to solution without facing failure, trade-offs, or any on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is low-voltage; while the &quot;quiver&quot; of the basilica implies physical stakes, the protagonist faces no resistance or meaningful risk of failure during the ritual. The struggle is purely internal and abstract, resolved through the successful completion of a procedure rather than a confrontation with a live counter-force.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist identifies the goal and achieves it instantly without external opposition or internal doubt. The "circuit breakers cooling" implies a time constraint that is never operationalized, leaving the stakes abstract and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story lacks an engine of conflict; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure to test the protagonist's commitment. Stakes remain abstract ("frequency of belonging") and are resolved without struggle, leaving the narrative flat and devoid of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.0)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist accepts the quest immediately and succeeds without facing a significant antagonist or dilemma. The climax is a puzzle solution (placing the watch hand) rather than a test of will or sacrifice, making the resolution feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the opposing negotiator offers no resistance, nodding and agreeing immediately. The stakes ("peace") are abstract and never imperiled on the page. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=2.7)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract, lacking external pressure or a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice a concrete asset to succeed. The escalation is linear and peaceful, lacking the friction required to make the "redemption" feel earned or the stakes palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is almost no conflict; the protagonist faces no active opposition, only "indifferent eyes." The choice to take the left tunnel is arbitrary ("drawn by the faint echo"), and the final sacrifice of the baseball carries low weight since the object was found only moments prior. Escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are theoretical; while the loss of humanity is mentioned, the protagonist's "steady" nature prevents this cost from landing emotionally or complicating the ritual. There is no escalation of pressure; the transition from human to hybrid is portrayed as a seamless, almost automatic success.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is negligible as the protagonist faces no active opposition or genuine dilemma; the ritual proceeds to success without requiring adaptation or sacrifice. The central tension—mourning a future not yet lived—remains a static thematic concept that never forces a difficult on-page choice or creates visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent, as the "dying galaxy" provides only background context rather than immediate, time-sensitive pressure on the page. The primary obstacle—the seam—yields to the protagonist's first attempt without forcing a difficult trade-off, adaptation, or sacrifice, rendering the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is no meaningful conflict or opposition; the protagonist seeks a "reset," and the universe immediately provides it via a friendly prophecy. The fisherman offers no resistance, only validation, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation of stakes. No price is paid for the transformation; the resolution is a gift rather than an achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.5)
    Tension is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of discovery while executing his plan. The revolution occurs "without a single shout," rendering the central conflict theoretical and devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.9)
    The stakes remain abstract; the "broken future" is mentioned but not felt as an immediate threat in the scene. The ritual proceeds without error or external opposition, and the resolution comes without a visible cost or trade-off, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.1)
    There is no antagonist or resistance; the storm cooperates with the poet, and the ritual succeeds exactly as planned. The stakes are purely abstract ("rarefy the weight," "cartography of scars") and are resolved without the protagonist paying a visible or felt price. The tension is linguistic, not dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes remain purely abstract ("the argument behind it") and are never grounded in a consequence that matters to the reader. The "shared victory" resolution epitomizes symmetric satisfaction, removing the tension of a zero-sum contest or a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "resistance" faces no on-page opposition, the guard is an ally, and the "anarchy" is a distant abstraction. Without an antagonist or a difficult trade-off, the protagonist’s success is instant and unearned, devoid of the tension required for a resistance narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.0)
    The stakes are purely metaphorical ("surprise fate") and lack a felt, on-page cost or risk. There is no active opposition; the protagonist simply waits for night and plays a song, with the environment offering compliance rather than resistance. The "climax" is a performance with no clear consequences for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the monsoon acts as a background timer rather than an immediate pressure forcing tactical trade-offs. The protagonist encounters no significant resistance—internal or external—during the ritual, resulting in a sequence that feels like a task completion rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.8)
    There are no stakes beyond an abstract "sorrow," and the protagonist faces no opposition—internal, external, or environmental. The resolution is inevitable from the first sentence; the compass simply works because the plot requires it, devoid of any "tightening" or "deepening" of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—feed mouths unseen—declared early; pressure escalates by accumulation: each donated sack ups the risk if patrols hear the bell. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening: children now carry sacks, tying knots, proving the chain will outlive elders. Agency is Mara’s persistence in ringing, not a single decisive act; cost is the nightly exposure of the bell tone. Coincidence absent; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to free unused love”—is signaled early and escalates via breath-paced discovery; each slower exhale tightens access to the reservoir. No external antagonist, but the veil of forgotten promises functions as coherent pressure that forces Milo’s stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual yet legible: once released, the love can’t be re-bottled, and the tear’s glow is spent. Agency remains internal and accumulative, sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“dissolve the boundaries between memory and moment”—is signaled early and never shifts. Pressure is ambient, not tightening; the child’s wonder is lovely but doesn’t narrow Mara’s options or raise cost. No visible price is extracted from the protagonist, so escalation stays moderate.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—seize moonbeams to unlock destiny—tightens once: from rose-code to moonbeam-map to chronicle library, each increment forecloses retreat. The tightening is driven by Lira’s interpretive agency; no coincidence resolves anything. Visible cost is conceptual (shift from thief to guardian) rather than material, slightly softening the “felt price” gate for 8.8+. Escalation is lyric-density, not causal-reversal, aligning with the accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes— craft safe zones for inquiry— stay abstract; no concrete scientist or jeopardy appears. Pressure accumulates via imagery (thaw, glass) rather than narrowing options; the “illusion of control” is abandoned narratively, not dramatized through a lost tool or forfeited plan. One visible cost (bookmark marking days) is too mild to tighten above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can Mara transmute fear into power?—tightens once: lever choice risks crushing aisles vs. chance at leviathan courage. Amber price (self-betrayal confession) is legible, paid on-page. Escalation is more emblematic than iterative; single turn suffices for length, but external jeopardy (collapse threat) is announced not experienced, keeping pressure cerebral. Fits Accumulative lens: density/cadence shift reweights cost rather than因果 chain.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can the night be mapped?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the last page poses its unanswerable question, forcing the oracle to choose between containment and surrender. Escalation is textural: each retelling adds “veins of shadow” to the parchment, reweighting the cost of continued mapping; the star’s extinction is the visible price. No external antagonist is needed; the void itself supplies coherent pressure. The final act—dissolving the map into breath—narrows options to acceptance, satisfying the lens-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can I locate the origin of thought?”—is signaled early and tightens when each melted droplet forecloses a loop. Agency is observation/interface rather than wrenching choice, but visible price is loss of captured resonance. Escalation accrues via density, not reversal; sufficient for 600-word Accumulative design. Could use one sharper trade-off to reach upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—thawing communal mistrust—is signaled early and escalates via each projection beat. The tightening occurs when the mayor’s new ticket proves the cycle must be maintained, narrowing Mara’s role from investigator to perpetual guardian. Cost is societal (transparency forever), but personal stakes for Mara stay oblique, keeping pressure slightly abstract. Agency is present yet gentle, fitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—garden recognition—is declared early; pressure deepens through iterative polishing that unveils new paths. Escalation is poetic accretion, not option-narrowing; no concrete resource lost or deadline imposed. Cost remains diffuse (acceptance of decay) rather than viscerally felt on page. Sufficient for sub-7 lyric piece but lacks the visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove time can move sideways—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the lever act. Escalation is single but decisive: the hush of wings at rest → amber cascade → flora unfurl → birds ascend; each beat tightens the uncanny. Cost is felt in the station-wide “icy warmth” that chills and comforts, foreclosing linear time. Agency is Lira’s alone; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“unravel the ghost’s silence”—is signaled early and tightens once: the watery staff lines demand a single note that bridges worlds. The price is atmospheric (the hall still floods; the ghost merely smiles), so the tightening feels aesthetic rather than tactical. Still, agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Sufficient for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—externalize the swallowed truth—signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: fever memory → smudge → barometer micro-tweak → console number; each layer reweights the stone’s mass. No antagonist; tension is situational/coherent. Cost is conceptual (she will carry the weight outward) rather than visceral; visible price could be sharper. Single meaningful tightening sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“quantify the swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens when the numeric pattern resolves into “emotional tonnage,” foreclosing the option to haul the wheel out. Cost is legible in the transferred weight to his ribs. Under Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase rather than causal reversal; the pattern break is sufficient. No credible resource loss (time, tool, stamina) is dramatized, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—will the keeper enter the refuge and be altered?—is signaled early; the only tightening is the narrowing fissure that funnels him to the river, but the cost is conceptual (dissolving thought) rather than a live option foreclosed. Escalation is textural: silence thickens, moss retracts, the hymn accumulates; agency remains observant traversal rather than decisive trade-off. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens yet never reaches a visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stake is clear—deliver wonder through music—but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price exacted when the song ends. Eclipse supplies grandeur, not escalation; consequently the tension curve is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—control of encoded fate—arrives early, but pressure escalates only through lyrical summary: “he realized... he set... he guided.” The visitor’s sudden comprehension is off-stage POV leakage; we neither feel the cookies’ cost nor witness a narrowing of the writer’s options. The tightening is poetic rather than tactical, so the cost remains atmospheric, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent possession of self or city—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each loop layer thickens the silence until the stillness ruptures; the tightening is legible. Visible price is oblique (his soul “might be consumed”), but the conceptual re-weighting of the city’s assumptions serves as the requisite cost under Accumulative lens. A crisper embodied forfeiture would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is announced early but pressure stays lyrical; no tightening beat forces a fork or forfeiture. Escalation is textural (repetition of “darkening brightness,” “periodically eternal”) rather than causal; options don’t narrow. The cost is conceptual at closure (tablet lost) but not felt as tactical sacrifice earlier. Agency remains contemplative; protagonist never risks a wrong corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—thaw emotional numbness—signaled in paragraph 1. Single meaningful tightening: flipping shells forward converts silent vibration into felt pressure, narrowing option to remain detached. Cost visible: “warming the cold inside her chest.” No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-mirrored. Escalation sufficient for 700-word span but not persistently costly post-scene, keeping sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth must escape quarantine—named by paragraph 2. One meaningful deepening: the quarantine is not just outside but now inside her routine; her archive-certainty is narrowed to pigeon-uncertainty. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (dusk, cat, tube, shaft) compresses choice until the final act. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she becomes the city’s clandestine postmaster, forfeiting open scholarship.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: seize or surrender the rope-memory of an escaped soul; signaled early (“trade his rope for a lantern”). Escalation is accretive: each forked tunnel offers a new song, densifies stakes, re-weights rope. Final deepening at stone heart forces renunciation—binding rope relinquishes future agency. Cost legible: rope luminesces, sealing poet’s verses inside wall-grooves; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished”—is signaled early; pressure is ambient, not tactical. No visible price or option foreclosure occurs; escalation is a gradual thickening of sonic texture rather than a decisive turn. Agency is expressive, not adaptive; she could walk away without loss. Cost is conceptual (world remains unfinished) but not viscerally felt by character.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harvest a sellable emotion—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each static crackle thickens the emotional residue until the vial’s click forecloses the option to stop. Visible price: the grotto retains a “whisper of static,” a permanent loss of secrecy. Could edge higher if a live buyer appeared to raise jeopardy, but the internal pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—returning the locket to complete a compassion cycle—is signaled early but never tightens; Mara’s options do not narrow, nor does she sacrifice anything tangible. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each shard adds a new contributor story, deepening texture rather than pressing choice. The single reversal (mother died at sea) is revealed, not tested; it deepens sentiment without altering tactics. Cost is symbolic (locket released), not felt by Mara, so pressure plateaus rather than peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—binding the community—signaled in paragraph two. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each reed laid, each face turned to the arbor, thickens the invisible web; the glyph’s pulse is the single micro-turn that reweights meaning. No visible price is paid by Arlen (she neither bleeds nor relinquishes a private dream), so the cost is collective and diffuse. Sufficient for lyric mode but keeps the score below 7.0 because no one’s tactical options are foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the city’s interrupted heartbeat—arrives early and tightens through cadence repetition; each “falter-resume” pulse escalates texturally rather than causally. One meaningful deepening: when she steps onto the ribbon of borrowed time, the option to retreat is foreclosed; cost is visible—she descends alone into the cavern. Agency is observational (she “whispers a prayer,” “presses pendant,” “releases”) rather than wrestle; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the final cadence shift from falter to steady rhythm is legible payoff under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—“understand the mathematics of emotion”—is announced early but remains cerebral; pressure escalates only texturally via accumulating droplet-notes and glowing numbers, never threatening loss or forcing a trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the conjurer’s path stays linear from arrival to departure. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the orchard gains petals, he gains insight, neither forfeits anything. Sufficient for lyric accumulative mode, yet sub-8.0 because escalation lacks visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared early (“become visible to those who need you”) but remain conceptual; the only on-page tightening is the commuters’ pause—an external observation, not a choice that narrows her options. No credible loss (time, risk of capture, forfeited anonymity) is dramatized, so escalation is present but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: will the leaf surrender its amber resistance? Pressure escalates via fungal contact and storm-season cadence; options narrow to wait-or-interfere, then crystallize into pure watchfulness. Cost is legible as forfeiture of control and time, but remains conceptual; a tangible resource loss (tools, data, nursery stock) would deepen 8-band. Still, the final image of new saplings under bowls reweights the stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are declared early: canvases vs. convergence. Pressure tightens once when the brooch demands the exchange; however, the escalation is mostly lyrical repetition (“rain trails whispered”) rather than a narrowing of options. The cost is real—paintings surrendered—but because Mara does not resist or bargain, agency reads passive; the turn is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the final mist-veil makes the trade undeniable, meeting the lens-specific requirement for Accumulative/Textural deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—stays abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off is tested. Pressure is atmospheric (air thickens, cave responds) rather than tactical; pilgrim’s prayer is instantly granted, child’s laugh instantly answered. No option is narrowed, no price is paid by Lira. Escalation is textural crescendo, not character-forced turn; coincidence-friendly, non-causal design accepted under Accumulative lens, but lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can exile end if memory stays private?—tightens as each dock’s fragment forecloses the option of solitary authorship. The meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist accepts the midnight summons to retrieve a legend lost in trench darkness; this visible price (leaving the harbor’s safety) crystallizes the shift from collector to connector. Agency remains accumulative rather than decisive; the valve’s chord is invitation, not confrontation, so cost is conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for 8-band, not the 8.8+ that demands a sharper tactical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access to hidden truths—tightens once: the phantom punch’s glow shifts from clue to key, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is textural, not causal; the price (perpetual nightly returns) is declared, not yet felt, keeping escalation just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—sculpting a reflective space—tightens when each tile shift exacts a micro-choice: continue transcribing or stop and confront the illogic. Escalation is accumulative: the unheard whale song deepens pattern density rather than forcing external reversals. The price is conceptual but visible: she forfeits empirical proof yet gains an open sanctuary, a trade-off legible in the tile’s “perfect square of calm.” No live clock or tangible loss beyond surrender of certainty keeps this just beneath the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will he confront finality?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each corridor adds density of farewell echoes, narrowing emotional options. However, no active trade-off or irreversible choice is dramatized; the climax is passive reception of insight. Cost is conceptual (loss of emptiness) rather than tangible, limiting escalation bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove lineage fairness to secure asylum”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when grief-fog must thicken enough to awaken ink. Single meaningful deepening occurs at the whispered formula, narrowing option from petition to covenant. Protagonist agency drives the turn; cost legible in her marrow dissolve and in commission’s breathed shift. Keeps within lens; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—capture invisible time-textures—signaled early; pressure intensifies via light-pattern density rather than external opposition. Escalation is a single deepening: dawn gold scatters, pages darken, silence pulses anew. Because no live option is foreclosed (he simply keeps walking), cost is atmospheric, not tactical; tension accrues but never narrows choice. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover erased histories—signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment adds density until the label’s numbers glow and project the murals, narrowing the narrator’s option to remain merely a passive observer. Cost is conceptual (permanent exile from official identity) rather than tangible; still legible under Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no reversal, but the projection is the decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the riddle of myth-permanence—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ledger’s question-marks force her to accept retelling as answer, narrowing her old destroy-the-myth stance. Pressure is situational/lyric rather than antagonistic; no credible loss is dramatized. Coincidence (shell glow points straight to ledger) is allowed under situational lens but limits escalation bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent privatization—signaled early; escalation is reputational rather than tactical: graffiti rearranges stalls, investors merely “unaware,” council politely delays. No credible resource lost or avenue closed for Mira; postponement is windfall, not forced trade-off. Tightening comes via symbolic display (phoenix mural) that reweights public perception—valid Accumulative turn—but price is communal pride, not personal cost. Agency diffuse: illustrators, council, investors share the causal load.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are legible from the first sentence: capture the last grain before sunlight erases it. Pressure tightens once—the chemical bar blackens, the shutter must fire—and that single turn forecloses all retry options. Cost is present (the grain will be “reclaimed by colonies”), yet the inspector neither sacrifices nor risks anything personal; the price is borne by the object, not the agent. Sufficient escalation for this length, but the absence of a lived-body trade-off caps the tension just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the drone fly true and carry her unseen vision onto the ship?—tightens once: the tear either seals or grounds the scout. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the cost is her exclusion from the voyage she enables. Coincidence (anchor lifts at exact repair completion) complicates without resolving, keeping pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—map the river’s origin—signals on page 1 and tightens when the condensation word ‘Kaltwasser’ appears: now the thaw is real, the map must be drawn tonight. One meaningful deepening is sufficient; the bell toll externalizes the cost. No second reversal, but the lens is accumulative/textural; density increase alone is enough.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: restore shared balance between people and architecture. Pressure escalates only texturally—each imagined footfall thickens the texture of renewal—rather than narrowing real options; the tuner never faces an opposing force or risk of failure. Because no live option is foreclosed, the cost remains conceptual (he leaves, his music done) rather than viscerally felt. The lyric accumulation satisfies the lens but keeps tension gentle; a single meaningful tightening is present yet low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieve vial, deliver hope—signaled early. Pressure remains static: danger is the abstract “battery waning,” never tightened by an on-page countdown or depleted resource. The single meaningful turn (letting beacon fade) is cost-free because the temple immediately returns the vial; no option is foreclosed. Instance of coincidence resolving tension, not complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is redeeming the “cry wolf” name by guiding future rescuers—signalled early, tightened when map unfolds to 3-D and he chooses story over alarm. Cost is implicit: lifelong silence/hush he must carry. Agency is present (he lifts, steps, whispers) but externalized; the bodies rise in grateful silence feels situational luck rather than forced trade-off, keeping it just below high band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—discharge the heart-debt—is signaled in line 3 and tightens through each cameo; the final sigh is the visible price that forecloses her continued haunting. Agency is present but lightly distributed across lyric shards; one decisive tightening would lift this to 8.8+. Still, the cadence shift from metallic frost to lantern-blossoms is felt, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—signals early and tightens through each unearthed relic; the meaningful deepening is the moment roots physically respond to the sundial base, turning abstract hope into bodily risk. Cost is conceptual: the vanished scholars foreshadow danger, and Mara’s solitary exhaustion is implied though not viscerally staged. Agency is accumulative—each fragment placed is a prayer—but no single beat forces a trade-off that forecloses an option. Sufficient for 8-band, but lacks a visible wound or irreversible sacrifice to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are declared—“discover meaning in the margins”—but never tightened into a live trade-off; no option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural (color-shift, drone rise) rather than causal; the pressure feels atmospheric, not agency-driven. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“truth vs. coup”—is signaled early and tightens once: the ledger pouch beat narrows options to act now or lose the city. Agency is attention and renunciation: she spends the irreplicable flame and relinquishes control of the map. Escalation is causal under inferred lens; coincidence complicates (wind code) but does not resolve. Visible price: ember consumed, anonymity forfeited, exposure irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—release or retain unsent letters—tightens when condensation forms the first writable surface; escalation is textural density, not causal reversals. Agency is present: she chooses to evoke, then to let the breeze scatter. Cost is the shard’s heat and the dissolving letters, but because coincidence delivers the scatter, the price feels half-earned. Still, the firefly transference reweights the stake under accumulative lens.</answer>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of vaporizable script: silence is not absence but transmutable matter. Subtext is in the shard’s warmth—apology needs vessel, not voice. Final image of fireflies as “bright promise” reweights prior refusal to speak into luminous potential, avoiding moralizing. The hymn-seal risks thematic echo but stays just implicit enough.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—transform shared anxiety into living tissue—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each smudged phrase is absorbed by coral. Escalation is textural: density of deciphered swells until the coral vibrates, reweighting the stake. The translator’s agency is attention/unknotting rather than a reversible decision, yet the perpetual ache is a felt price. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are declared—“share lost joy”—but never sharpened: no opposition, no dwindling paint, no doubting spectator, no ticking dusk. Pressure plateaus at “passersby stopped”; the mural grows, the fog lifts, but nothing is risked or foreclosed. A single meaningful tightening is required; instead we get iterative affirmation. The orchard’s rebirth is gifted, not earned through trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stake—curiosity vs certainty—is signaled early and re-asserted in the final smile, but pressure escalates only by accretive imagery, not narrowing options. The protagonist never risks failure or forfeits a concrete alternative; the “cost” is purely atmospheric. Under an Accumulative lens this is permissible, yet the absence of a visible price or constraint keeps the tension decorative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—untaxed thought—remains conceptual; escalation is pattern-dense spirals rather than narrowing options. The warp is atmospheric, not a tactic-altering turn. Cost is conceptual (garden now speakable only in riddles) and legible; still, one visible forfeiture would sharpen the pressure.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges via vegetal cipher vs. taxable language; no final moralizing. The gourd seed’s rattle re-prices thought as percussion, not commodity. Subtext lives in seedling angles and insect silence—quiet but resonant. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transmute collective heartbreak into healing verse—is announced early but never tightens; no new obstacle raises the cost of failure, and success is continuous rather than decisive. Escalation is accretive: each lullaby-layer adds luminescence, yet the poet’s options neither narrow nor flip. The “blossom armistice” arrives as gift, not earned reversal. Because the conflict is lyrical stasis, pressure feels ambient, not perilous; the closing peace is granted, not wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is declared early but never tested; no obstacle threatens the ritual. Pressure is ambient (feelings fade) rather than immediate. Traveler’s arrival adds resonance yet changes nothing for the caretaker’s tactics or risk. One gentle deepening—names leave with traveler—but no option is foreclosed, no price exacted on page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve sanctuary vs. irrigate city—tightens with each calibration click; the council schism is the off-page antagonist, but the valve test is the on-page crucible. Escalation is measured in micro-pressure: glue imprint → binary → chain tension → water lullaby; each step raises the cost of failure (rupture or drought). Final price is conceptual but legible: the city must now live inside an empathy protocol it can’t unplug.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve lost songs by encoding them into transmittable trails. Pressure escalates via density—dust maps multiply, pigeons carry more slices, attic chorus swells—rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: when she risks the final sliver of meteorite, the map becomes “a living heart,” foreclosing future edits. Cost is conceptual (the chip fades) rather than visceral; still, agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode exit before maze re-configures—signals at copper plate; tightening occurs when ink symbols glow teal, narrowing options to single spiral. Cost is visible: each shed leaf of loss sticks to his soles, staining the glass floor with husk dust, a persistent constraint against return. No antagonist but entropy; agency remains his to read or fail. Escalation is modest yet sufficient for lyric mode: one deepening, not multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—stay abstract; no visible price or narrowing of options occurs. The city’s hum escalates lyric density but does not force a decision or trade-off. Agency is contemplative, not consequential; coincidence (fireflies awaken instruments) supplies the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightens as each seed-color forecloses alternative routes until only the fissure remains. The final seed’s insertion is a decisive narrowing that costs the cave its cheerful gloom, replacing it with warm melancholy; the price is felt, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lone stake is aesthetic: can the performer wrest a transient pattern from chaos before the tide erases it? Escalation is textural—each added bishop, ink swirl, violin phrase thickens the texture until the final cadence—so pressure accumulates rather than tightens options. No antagonist or reversal is needed under this lens; the tide’s inevitable return is the coherent pressure. Cost is the washed-clean slate; the price is the loss of the pattern he just created, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“write a cosmic verse on skin”—is declared early but never tested by opposition or risk; no alternative path is foreclosed. Pressure remains ambient, rising only through denser imagery rather than narrowed agency. The final act succeeds exactly as envisioned, so escalation is decorative, not tactical. Cost is retrospective and conceptual, not experienced as loss within the conflict window.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is declared early and deepened through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. The single meaningful tightening is the nets’ transfiguration, a purely perceptual escalation; no option is narrowed, no price exacted from Mira. Sufficient for lyric mode, but lacks the trade-off or constraint required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore faith via visible proof—is declared early; pressure escalates through each balloon’s micro-result (needle flicker), tightening communal attention. Yet the protagonist’s personal risk plateaus; the zero arrives as confirmation, not trade-off. Cost is felt by the collective, visible in their overnight labor, satisfying the band but not the 8.8+ threshold that demands a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular: map the walls’ dream. Pressure escalates by accumulation—each artifact adds tonal density until the corridor hums, a meaningful deepening under the Textural lens. The hum is not a reversible triumph; it forecloses her former silence, so cost is present. Yet the beat never tightens through a hard choice or trade-off; the discovery simply arrives as gift, keeping the score shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are announced—“persuade mirrors to show possibilities”—but no resistance or trade-off appears; the painter paints, the mirrors comply. No option is foreclosed, no price paid, no escalation beyond aesthetic crescendo; the bell-toll is release, not cost. Conflict remains decorative rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can ink and ritual outbid blood spite—signals early and tightens once: the sword-placing beat physically forecloses return to war, cost paid in the leaders’ public vulnerability. Agency is accumulative rather than reversal-driven; Lira’s steady inscription increases social density until refusal becomes more awkward than compliance. The price is conceptual but visible—bronze laid against wood under star-witness. No secondary escalation, yet the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled in paragraph 1: preserve extinct voice via manufactured drought. One meaningful tightening occurs when the thunder lull creates a one-shot window; failure = lost echo forever. Agency is present: his hand releases the egg, not luck. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the same drought that killed the species becomes the resonant stage that preserves its ghost—moral burden crystallizes without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—breaking conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early and tightens through each untangled thread; every filament loosened increases audible dissent in the city, a visible price. One meaningful escalation beat: the moment the courtyard stones tremble, her private act becomes public consequence, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible on-page in the final image of dawn-lit snowflakes that “whisper a promise,” a conceptual price she must now live inside.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reversing narrative control—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no live dilemma narrows options. Escalation is a single cadence shift: ember brightens → string image → exit; cost is conceptual, not visceral. Under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices, but the absence of a tested choice keeps tension lyric rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—honor forgotten histories—faces only internal pressure: time of butterfly migration supplies ticking clock, but no outside force opposes her homage. Escalation arrives as accumulating density (each knot raises stakes for future seekers) rather than narrowed options; cost is the certain dissolution of her work at sunrise, legible on-page. Agency is pure endurance/attention, not contested choice, so tension plateaus rather than spikes. Sufficient for the lyric frame but shy of high-band urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stake—preserve forgotten names—is declared early but never complicated; no name resists transcription, no resource is depleted, no ethical tension surfaces. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: the rope glows, names release, sanctum thaws—each escalation is a beneficent amplification without trade-off. The lone traveler’s arrival adds a coda, not a reversal. No option narrows, no price is exacted; the conflict is purely restorative.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will the forest reveal why paths choose?—is signaled early but abstract; escalation comes via atmospheric deepening (storm growl, seal glow, spore vortex) rather than narrowed options. Agency is largely receptive: she whispers gratitude, the forest answers. Tightening is present as luminous trail tug, yet no concrete trade-off or loss is dramatized; cost is conceptual (directive rewritten) not visceral. Pressure is poetic but low-heat; sufficient for lyric mode, yet not clutching.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“seal a covenant with the unknown” is signaled early and tightens when the inter-regime window threatens to close. The meaningful turn is the final tracing that fuses Jupiter, Venus, moon, and tile into one irreversible signature; cost is the palace inhaling dusk, grain stores forever re-ledgered. Agency is continuous: sketching, aligning, tracing—each action forecloses retreat. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“can resentment be dissolved without violence?”—is signaled early and deepens as each monk touches the box; the tightening is lyrical repetition rather than rising risk, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is present but diffused: the monks’ bitterness is traded for empathy, yet the price is felt more communally than personally. A single meaningful intensification suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recapture the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens through each breathing cycle: fog thins, sextant straightens, dream’s thread approaches; options narrow to inhale-or-fail. Agency is sustained attention and controlled exhalation; cost is the perceptual dissolution of boundaries (“the world around him seemed to melt”). No coincidence; escalation is one-directional and lyrical, sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restore sight & generational bridge) is signaled early; pressure tightens when the ribbon snag forces improvised use of bag contents, linking mending glass to healing kin. Escalation is accumulative—each lens shard re-weights the stake—rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric mode. Visible price: she commits to seasonal return, foreclosing guild nostalgia. Luck assists (light through glass) but does not resolve; agency remains in her strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the library of unlearned lessons”—is declared early but remains abstract; we never feel what is personally lost if she fails. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: each gap sings louder, yet Selene’s options never narrow and no price is exacted. The vines’ bargain is smooth, not costly. Agency is largely observational; the portal finale simply appears, implying infinite sequels rather than a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover lost names—signaled early; pressure tightens when ink-river threatens to erase verses. Agency visible: she threads, dives, nets, assembles; each step forfeits passivity. No secondary loss (tool, wound) on-page, so cost is conceptual not visceral; caps ascent to high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are declared (“unlock the door’s paradox”) but never sharpened—no ticking countdown, no risk of bodily or social loss. The single tightening is the rope-braiding moment, yet it reads as ritual choreography rather than a trade-off that forecloses an option; pressure remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens once: the stone must be found and placed before the resonant storm peaks. Agency is present: tracing cracks, lifting stone, aligning it with the spine fissure. Cost is atmospheric (storm dims) rather than a forfeited object or option; pressure coheres under Situational lens but never narrows to a trade-off that hurts the protagonist. Enough for solid 8-band, but lacks a visible price that alters his future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“prove pattern exists”—stays abstract; no external obstacle or internal counter-desire threatens failure, so pressure plateaus. Escalation is purely cadence: each paragraph adds another hopeful witness; options never narrow, no trade-off forced. Caravan arrival is additive luck, not tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—proving memory can be mapped by light—arrives early but stays intellectual; no credible loss or ticking clock tightens options. Pressure accumulates through imagery density, not agency; the archivist never tests his conjecture against failure, counter-evidence, or external resistance. The sole “tightening” is the fog thickening, a passive environmental cue rather than a choice-forcing moment. Thus escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is poetic, not felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—replace star-less void with handmade light—signaled early; tightening occurs when each spark lands on an unseen tile, narrowing possibility to one completed mosaic note. Agency is accumulative (each chant/spark is a tile laid) rather than a single decisive trade-off. Cost is conceptual (oil, breath, time) but not viscerally felt on page. Escalation is density, not risk.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will the clans bend?—is signaled early but remains off-stage; pressure is vicarious, not lived. Escalation is textural: each ripple thickens the omen-layer until the cicada glows, a valid accumulative tightening, yet the protagonist risks nothing personal. Cost is conceptual (pride surrendered somewhere else) rather than felt on her skin. Agency is observational, so the beat satisfies the lens but not the high-band price test.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—acquire silence flavors—tightens neatly: each inversion minute narrows to one breath per silence, foregrounding the cost of over-exposure. Agency stays frontal: Lio decides to climb, decides when to stop inhaling, decides to descend. The hourglass mechanic is legible and alters tactics in real time. The absence of an external antagonist is fitting; pressure is situational and still coherent. Cost is visible yet modest (loss of filaments at snap-back); a sharper forfeiture—say, permanent vertigo or porcelain fracture—would have pushed it into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is the creation of a teachable silence; pressure escalates texturally—each added sensory layer raises the bar for the final hush. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the vial bursts into silver, turning abstract calm into visible medium. No option is foreclosed for Lira, so the cost is borne by the reader’s attention rather than the protagonist’s choice—sufficient for lyric mode yet short of visceral stake.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can the void be taught breath?—is signaled in the opening sentence and tightens via each encroaching step and ember laid. Escalation is textural: density of starlight veins, pulse of the threshold, slow dimming of constellations; the deepening reweights the stake from solitary exile to luminous conduit. Agency is present yet contemplative; the keeper’s final renunciation forecloses retreat with visible cost (ring abandoned). A sharper external test or risk of bodily peril would have lifted the score into the 8.8+ tier, but the accruing luminosity is a legitimate Accumulative tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—turning past oppression into literal sparkle—emerges early and tightens once: the volunteer must decide whether to surrender the bolt to the chamber. No reversals, but the single deepening (pressure rising = diamonds forming) is legible under Accumulative lens. Cost is primarily conceptual (the bolt’s submarine history is spent), not a felt forfeiture for the human; this keeps it from the 8.8 tier. Still, agency sits with the protagonist’s hand turning the valve, coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover lost truth—tightens once: the confession revalues lineage from glory to betrayal. Pressure is textural (density of sound imagery) rather than causal, appropriate to the lens, but the cost is intellectual, not visceral; no option is foreclosed for Lian personally.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“shape of possibility”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as each alchemical element narrows options toward bodily surrender. No external antagonist, but accretive texture forces stance crystallization: final fusion forecloses solitary wandering. Cost is legible in the armor’s loss; escalation is steady under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering silenced children’s stories—signals early and tightens once when the button’s silhouette reveals blanked records. Amelia’s agency is gentle attention rather than risk; no concrete price (job security, emotional safety) is tested. Escalation is textural: dust patterns accumulate, silhouettes deepen, but the lens is situational pressure without narrowing options. The final image reconfigures meaning but is not preceded by a trade-off that could be lost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—truth broadcast vs. regime indifference—tightens once: map → key → transmission narrows options to one slot. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: rulers must “confront the ghosts they ignored.” No visible personal loss; hence not quite 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent fire-storm—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each whispered note dissolves a syllable, deepening the stakes by shrinking the threat. No reversal, but a meaningful cadence shift when the final sigh confirms the code is gone. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—decode or remain blind—surfaces early; pressure escalates through each leaf deciphered, but the spring discovery is a gift, not a narrowing trade-off; cost is aesthetic rather than tactical, keeping tension just below the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s quest to decipher the frozen compass—signals early and tightens once: the needle’s first tremor forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible (no lost tool or injury), but the inscription’s command reweights her future craft. Agency stays internal; the external world obliges too readily (tunnel opens, coals still glow), so pressure feels situational more than adversarial. Still, the final stance crystallizes with visible consequence for her occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can the cracked coin (and by proxy her self-ledger) be redeemed—signalled at word 60. Tightening occurs when the crack widens on naming, forcing the immediate gold pour; this is the single meaningful escalation. Cost is the irreversible fusion of dragon name to personal history; the regret is not erased but gilded. Agency is her decision to speak the name, not luck; pressure is internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“can these whispers be converted to laughter?”—is signaled early; pressure accumulates via each bent harp note tightening the acoustic noose. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes laughter is the missing reagent, forcing her to hazard the goat joke; the cost is social-aesthetic (ridicule risk) rather than bodily, but it is visible. Escalation is textural: sorrow density increases until the pattern snaps into giggles; no coincidence resolves the turn. Could wish for a sharper tactical loss (tooth cracks? voice hoarse?), but the felt acoustic shift meets the bar.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—derive mercy formula—declared early and tightened by each cost-flash. One meaningful deepening: when violet light softens to amber after she whispers the equation, the forest’s acceptance forecloses retreat; remaining option is to carry the formula outward. Price is legible on skin and in strap warmth. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversing, sufficient for 750-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—signals early; pressure mounts via pattern convergence that risks permanent erasure of memory if translator mis-aligns. Escalation is accretive: each painting clue layers density until “air shivers” and chain loosens; no artificial reversals. Cost is conceptual—loss of tangible relic—but felt weight registers on page. Could use one sharper tactical trade-off mid-process to hit 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—is signaled early and pursued single-mindedly. Pressure escalates only by accretion: each new textual layer (dust map, mirror ghosts, ledger) deepens ambiance rather than threatening or foreclosing. Agency is pure observation; no live option is sacrificed, no price is exacted from Mara. Consequently, tension is atmospheric, not consequential; the tightening is poetic, not strategic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“compress eternity”—is clear early; pressure escalates via density of cracks, shards, humming pages rather than causally narrowing options. One meaningful deepening occurs when rupture turns frost curves into conduits, but the cost is conceptual (system revealed illusory) rather than a tactical trade-off paid by Mara. Agency is present but externalized: the world rewrites itself; she merely “places the page back,” so price feels gifted, not seized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the town’s sonic drowning—remains abstract; no on-page consequence of failure (cracking walls, fleeing villagers) is shown, so pressure stays intellectual. Escalation arrives as density of description rather than narrowing options; the only live narrowing is the off-stage ticking toward midnight, which Alder cannot hasten or delay. Visible price is limited to the chip’s glow; the townsfolk’s relief is reported, not felt, keeping cost conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reach the place where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens through each sensory intensification rather than external opposition. No antagonist or reversal is required under Accumulative lens; pressure mounts as each new threshold (tunnel → lagoon → crystal vortex) narrows options toward wordless surrender. Cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but the compass’s ingestion and the world-tilt make the price visible. Could wish for one earlier material risk (air supply, fall hazard) to raise visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—turning splinters into bridges—remains abstract; no concrete price is risked or paid. Pressure intensifies atmospherically (storm softens, lantern glows brighter) but does not foreclose an option or force a trade-off. Mira’s agency is contemplative rather than consequential; the crowd’s “unseen pull” is an effect, not a decision she confronts. Escalation is textural density, not narrowing choice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will the night flower answer repay her lifelong doubt?”—is signaled early and tightens when the glass must respond to the postcard. Escalation is textural: each sepia face adds refractive pressure until the hidden garden pulsing with her heartbeat forces stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (winter-doubt surrendered) rather than visceral, but legible in the final image. No false cliffhangers; coincidence merely reveals, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“revive the ghost town via memory”—is signaled early; escalation is the gradual accretion of recalled names/songs until lanterns flare. Agency is cognitive (recollection), not physical; under Accumulative lens, deepening is acceptable, but the lack of a live fork or tangible loss keeps cost conceptual rather than visceral. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the plan simply succeeds in vision. Thus tension plateaus rather than tightens, though the final bloom still carries a soft reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve or suppress the accidental prophecy—tightens when the wax shaving releases the city’s sighs; options narrow to record or erase. Agency is attention/renunciation: Harel chooses inscription, paying with his own ink. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversals; pattern break (dead voice in living orchard) reweights stakes. Cost visible: personal ink = blood, sealing archive loop.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the phoenix frost-fire cycle alive—signals early and tightens when the vortex demands the acorn cap as anchor. The single meaningful intensification is the cap’s surrender; it narrows Mira’s option from guardian to inheritor, but the cost is more luminous than painful. Agency is present (she places the cap, inhales, plants the shadow-seed), yet the external magic does most of the work. No visible price alters later tactics; the “borrowed time” texture is discovered, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—replace clangor with measured listening—signals early; escalation is the incremental sensor sync culminating in the first tuned bell tone. No reversal, just tightening; cost is symbolic (loss of old certainty) rather than tangible. Agency is cerebral (patience, calibration) yet visible. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is the necessity to honor fallen stars through compassionate witness; pressure accumulates with each traced trajectory. No external antagonist, but the cosmos’ indifference tightens via stillness. One meaningful deepening: the tremor response crystallizes vulnerability-turned-strength. Cost is conceptual—internal dawn—visible in the final ribbon, sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of unspoken words”—is stated early but never tested by an opposing force; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is poetic layering, not option-narrowing; no visible price alters his tactics. The covenant deepens in symbolic hue, yet the protagonist’s stance remains static; thus the tightening is felt as texture, not jeopardy. Meets Accumulative standard for one intensification, but causal urgency is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are declared early (“rediscover the capsule’s purpose before the last grain”), tightened when the urn fragment proves to be the key, and paid off when the valley’s memories become visible threads; the tightening is single but legible. Agency is reactive—Mara finds rather than risks—so escalation is pattern-deepening, not option-narrowing. Cost is communal (villagers’ memories exposed) rather than personal, keeping pressure coherent but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepens via each ripple that “knits” rather than erases imperfection. Agency is contemplative, not tactical; the only cost is abstract (acceptance of perpetual incompletion), which softens visceral pressure. One meaningful tightening: gust snaps tension, forcing the poet to re-see flaw as hymn—this is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—six-month death decree—tightens every dawn wiring beat; calendar pages shorten but orchard resonance lengthens, creating a meaningful cadence shift. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each copper wrap increases communal pilgrimage density until council’s stance becomes untenable. No visible resource lost except time, but that absence is repriced when time limit is abolished. Agency is attention and endurance rather than overt confrontation; fits Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove inquiry > awe—tightens when the tower answers Arin’s amber offering, foreclosing the scholars’ worship option. Escalation is textural: density of rain, glow, and vibration layers until the tower breathes. Cost is legible: the amber expires, Arin accepts outsider status. Agency is active (spreading amber, whispering offer), but the external reversal is initiated by the tower, not Arin, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: will the dead tongue translate into living growth? Pressure mounts via pattern accumulation—each bird-call narrows which pod can be released. The coachman’s agency is attention/ritual endurance; the price is the unrecoverable past he carries. No reversible turn, but the tightening of pattern suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"translate distance into closeness"—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tested by each color-stanza. Escalation is accumulative: each spectral revelation tightens the noose of memory until the leaf’s hum becomes unbearable proximity. Agency remains canine-physical (sniff, nudge, bark) rather than strategic, but the final resealing is a decisive refusal that costs oblivion. Price is unmistakable: he volunteers to carry every voice, a lifelong weight.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—find a compass-bearing in a mapless world—is signaled early and tightens only once, through the glimpse of pre-shutdown vitality; that vision re-weights the cost of continued pilgrimage versus surrender. Pressure is textural: each anniversary sketch adds density rather than narrows options, sufficient for the accumulative design but never forces a decisive trade-off. No visible price (time, safety, resource) is paid on-page, so escalation stays conceptual. Still, the final overlay line pulses like a heartbeat, giving a credible micro-turn that satisfies the 600-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“amend the curse”—is signaled early and narrows to the final swap. Pressure escalates via accumulative texture: each chess release softens ice audibly, a audible countdown. Yet the cost is borne by the world, not the protagonist; personal stakes remain abstract. Sufficient tightening for this length, but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is preserving vanished small acts before new power erases them; signaled early (“she vowed to become the historian”). Pressure is atmospheric, not antagonistic: the risk is forgetting, tightened by the gallery’s inhale/exhale and the penumbra’s pruning. The meaningful turn is the click-reveal of the scroll; it changes her option from searcher to custodian, visible on page. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she shoulders “quiet charge” but no tangible loss or foreclosed path is felt, keeping escalation muted.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find the shape of home”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when memory turns painful (mid-text deepening). No external antagonist, yet pressure is coherent: each feather-stroke escalates the cost of hallucinated home versus lived homelessness. Final corridor/book beat narrows option from seeking place to carrying resonance, a clear agency-driven reconfiguration. Price is conceptual rather than tangible, but accumulative design makes the reweighting felt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightened once: the pawn-dissolution scene forecloses retreat. Pressure is accumulative/textural; each corridor reflection adds density rather than new external obstacles. Cost is felt (labyrinth softens, exile remains), but the price is largely internal; a sharper external ramification would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—communal absolution via artistic ransom—tightens when each added stanza makes withdrawal impossible without silencing the entire canyon. Escalation is accumulative: density of refracted voices, not external opposition. Cost is legible in Mara’s shoulder-settling dust and the glowing mural that consumes her pigment, but the pressure plateaus rather than spikes in a final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is declared early. Escalation is textural: each narrated phrase adds luminous filament, deepening density rather than narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off occurs; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. The acid sea’s calm feels like concession to the story rather than consequence of her agency, capping the score under 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“find a moment that will not dissolve”—is signaled early; the tightening occurs when the key proves the moment can be hoarded, narrowing future options to secrecy. Cost is present but abstract (solitude, silence); no concrete loss (time, tool, relationship) is dramatized, so pressure stays lyrical rather than visceral. Sufficient for 7-band, but the lack of a palpable forfeiture keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and deepens through each pulse of intent. One meaningful tightening: cracking the vial seal purifies the air and forecloses retreat; the visible price is the emptied, light-spilling cork. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer (scent, vibration, light) reweights the same stake rather than narrows options causally. Cost is conceptual but legible: the sea’s sigh wraps the tower like a lover, affirming her softness as viable force.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—give shape to emptiness—remains abstract; escalation is atmospheric (signal steadies, ships appear) rather than a narrowing of options for the protagonist. The lattice build is the only visible trade-off, but it succeeds without observable price. Conceptual cost at the end keeps it above 6, but agency is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the stranger be erased?”—is signaled early. Escalation is density/cadence: each tide-gap he maps tightens the obligation until the longest lull forces the flower placement. Agency is observation-as-action; cost is sleepless vigil. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is epistemic—will Elian locate the doorway?—but pressure plateaus once the corridor appears; no new obstacle or trade-off emerges. Escalation is poetic, not causal; the creek’s rising is metaphorical clock, not threat. Agency is observational; following ants is passive discovery rather than decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—stop recurring dreams—clear early. Pressure accumulates via ascent & starlight density, but no visible cost (fatigue, injury, social risk) is dramatized; orb-burst solves rather than tightens. One meaningful deepening occurs when map-in-basin redirects to alcove, narrowing option under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—stays abstract; no concrete risk or omission tested. Pressure is lyrical accumulation, not narrowing options. Tightening occurs when breath is added, but cost remains metaphorical. Agency is collective ritual; no individual trade-off forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“trap the wild gusts of memory”—is declared early; pressure mounts by density, not external threat. The mid-story dream delivers the promised tightening (fox of mist dissolves on approach), reweighting the stake with felt loss. No visible resource is forfeited, so cost stays conceptual; still, the final image forecloses the earlier dread of being buried, turning the grave into generative space.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can Lena re-enchant a fragment of birth?—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens; each lyrical beat merely re-states the same affirmation. Without a mid-course obstacle or trade-off, escalation plateaus; the sunrise coincidence provides uplift rather than a narrowing of options, so the requisite felt price never materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—signaled early; pressure escalates via accretion of sensory density rather than causal reversal. One meaningful tightening: quill tip submerged, shards flare, scars coalesce into light; cost is legible as luminous permanence, but no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (deliver apology) signaled in para 3. Escalation via accumulative pattern: each scent/music beat thickens regret until apology sheet falls—visible price that narrows future silence. Agency is attention/ritual endurance rather than external fight; still forecloses path to inaction. Cost is atmospheric yet legible—orchidgeist accepts permanent relational loss while sound-carrying wind remains.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unravel cosmic illusions—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the spiral glyphs demand she surrender physical coherence. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the crystal: continue and vanish, or stop and keep false constellations; she chooses, paying with body. Pressure is accumulative—each translated tablet adds weight until the map folds. Cost is legible, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; hence shy of 8.8.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
    <comment>Theme emerges from motif of silence that accrues meaning: initial “resounding hush” is aesthetic, final hush is ontological—silence as the medium of truth. No moral spoken; the reconfigured cosmos is shown by image of converged horizon. Dictionary’s reprise as “quiet beacon” reweights earlier signal into emblem of sustained balance. Avoids tidy profundity, but epiphany is slightly single-note; complexity is conceptual rather than emotional, capping score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“what clocks really measure”—is declared early; pressure tightens once via the zero-count release that fuses tide and machine. Cost is oblique (lifetime of vigilance accepted) rather than a visible forfeit on the page. Agency is contemplative, not tactical; escalation is cadence-based, sufficient under Accumulative lens but thin for high-band cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the farm without hardening it—announced early. Escalation is accretive: each laser trace deepens the texture of guardianship rather than narrows options. Storm sequence provides external test, not protagonist-driven reversal; no visible price paid by narrator (no lost sleep, broken trust, or forfeited tool). Agency stays observational; tension is aesthetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can probability theory embrace true chance?—is signaled early and tightened when the subway map forces her to walk random intersections that mirror ½^i series. One visible cost: the sputtering flame at exit signals finite life, foreclosing infinite gambles. Escalation is single but sufficient for length; coincidence (seat clicks) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether estrangement can become connection—tightens as each wrong-number voice thickens the loop. Pressure escalates texturally: the disc’s tone grows denser, the tunnel “breathes softer,” implying stakes without raising external jeopardy. Because Mara faces no concrete trade-off, the cost remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve small moments”—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. Escalation is a thickening of lyric texture rather than a narrowing of choices. Cost is aesthetic (melancholy, chill) rather than actionable, keeping tension at the threshold of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver loneliness cure—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when she vows to share any discovered cure. Agency drives every beat: she summons the caretaker, hacks the shears-contraption, and chooses to pass the fragment rather than keep it. Cost is visible: relinquishing the moon rock’s warmth enacts the reciprocity she preaches. One meaningful tightening suffices under 800-word scope; escalation is causal, not multi-reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—map interior emotion—tightens when the melody shifts to a single tone that forecloses retreat; she must touch the wounded oak or lose the trail forever. Cost is visible: absorption of forest sorrow through skin leaves her “mind a cartographer of inner realms,” a role she can neither renounce nor fully survive. Agency preserved throughout; ring dowsing and skin-language are her decisions, not gifts. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens—pattern break at pure tone reweights all prior notes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—restore corrupted orchard without erasing self—signaled early. Pressure escalates via texture: tangled light-ribbons slowly straighten as pen rewrites; anomaly’s tide keeps options precarious. Agency is present—narrator chooses to “unbend” logic and whisper edits—but the tightening is lyrical rather than a single forked path with felt forfeiture. Cost is conceptual (accepting uncertainty) not visceral, adequate for length but keeps score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“can silence be kept alive as music?”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern, not threat. Each shutterless click removes the option of photographic proof, forcing reliance on embodied sign; this is the meaningful turn. Escalation is Accumulative: ripple, gesture, gust, echo—density rather than danger. The price is conceptual but unmistakable: the creator must disappear for the composition to persist, a renunciation that forecloses future recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—rescue the promise—signals early. One meaningful tightening: pressing the tapestry slides the stone, foreclosing retreat. Cost is present (his prior identity as arsonist is abandoned), but the price is declared rather than dramatized within the closing beat, keeping it just below the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—transform sterile lab sorrow into shared living song—arrives early and tightens through pattern intensification: each drumbeat literally brightens blossoms and lifts memories into firefly orbs. Agency is present yet gentle; Lira’s percussion is the causal engine, but the final institutional shift is relayed summarily, blunting the visible price. One clear deepening occurs when the sky answers her crescendo with funereal yet renewing aurora, foreclosing escape and locking her into caretaker role. Cost is present (perpetual drumming, sorrow absorbed), but because the staff’s conversion is off-page, the escalation feels slightly vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can a whisper outrun a shout?—tightens once when the radio repeats the phrase, foreclosing doubt. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; the story opts for quiet confirmation over tangible loss, capping intensity just below the 8-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness to value stars—is declared early but remains abstract; no visible price or forfeiture is risked. Escalation is textural (slower ripples, fading glints) rather than a tightening that forecloses options; the guardian never meets resistance or faces failure. Agency is entirely one-directional and calm, so pressure feels ambient, not urgent. Cost is conceptual only, insufficiently dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus guardianship—tightens when the island’s appearance forces Mara to choose: use the bone for personal escape or release ancestral spirits. Escalation is textural: each pulse of sea, bone, and crystal layers pressure until renunciation is the only narrow option left. No coincidence resolves; the whale arrives only after her song detonates the compartment. Cost is the splintered relic and the forever-duty she carries back to the docks.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can grief breathe inside forced joy?—tightens once: the baton’s completion narrows Mara’s options to private hush or public smile. Agency is purely gestural and narrative, yet the cost is felt: she forfeits overt resistance. No reversal, but the deepening cadence reweights the stake under Accumulative lens; turbine speed mirrors the internal intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stake—“dissolve boundaries”—is declared early; pressure accumulates via chromatic and sonic intensification rather than narrowing options. One meaningful tightening: the veil lifts to reveal star tapestry, re-configuring ice/air divide. Cost is conceptual (old prohibitions fold) but not viscerally felt; no resource lost, no path foreclosed. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical, satisfying Accumulative lens but staying emotionally static.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—trading perfect sight for imperfect wonder—tightens through each plant-reed transaction; the teal chord and night-cereus circle are visible tightenings. Escalation is accumulative: each hue confessed narrows her palette toward acceptance; the final glass garden crystallizes the cost, though the phoenix remains an ambient intensifier rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can engineered kinship feel real?—tightens as each spectral ribbon maps unlit synapses; the mind’s sigh signals a deepening, not a reversal, under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist, but internal risk of sterile artifice keeps pressure alive. Cost is conceptual: the bell-ringer accepts that every cycle only deepens the question, a credible micro-renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—remapping grief into再生—is signaled early; escalation is gradual pattern-accumulation rather than narrowing options. Each crane deposits a filament that lengthens the pilgrimage, a visible metric of deepening commitment. The rose’s revival is the single tightening beat, but it is staged as revelation rather than a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. Cost is present (she forfeits old identity, stains fingers), yet luck (rose waiting) partly dilutes agency-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“map cultural patterns to find a blueprint of hope”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the hum at corridor intersection deepens her method from abstract math to listening for grandmother’s song. Price is paid: the tape’s worn scars, the droplet’s reflection of lost worlds. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies the 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes—access to forbidden knowledge—are announced early, but pressure escalates only by lyrical intensification (“air grew heavy,” “cascade of light”) rather than a narrowing of options or visible cost. The single “purification” moment is authorially guaranteed once random stepping succeeds; no resource is spent or lost. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is sensuous but not consequential enough for 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are announced—preserve hope, trap the shadow—but the shadow never pushes back; footage loops unchanged, so pressure is ambient, not escalating.只有一个 meaningful turn: placing stone beside screen; it brightens without demanding trade-off or risk. Cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page, so escalation reads as decorous accumulation rather than rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after a con—is signaled early and narrowed to the single tail-tip. Pressure escalates texturally: each discarded fragment absorbed by mist tightens the moral space. The protagonist’s agency is present (she decides to return the tip), but the tightening is more symbolic than tactical; no live option is foreclosed with a price we can feel in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can scars teach hope?—tightens when moss demands the protagonist’s own scar pattern; refusal costs the miracle. Escalation is lyric-density: each sand grain amplifies the child’s lost miracle, re-weighting personal grief toward cosmic scale. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic—will the pattern unlock? Visible price: protagonist forfeits omniscient stance, accepting perpetual wound-doorways. Coincidence (star-healed child) complicates rather than resolves, remaining displaced.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or ticking clock sharpens it. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: each discovery deepens aura rather than limiting options. Escalation is poetic accrual rather than a turning point that forecloses a path; therefore cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Sufficient for mid-band under Accumulative lens, but entry to 8+ requires a moment where a live option is sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate bottled creativity—is visible from first paragraph and tightens through pattern accumulation: each traced star = louder unheard verses, brighter instrument, accelerating fatigue. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/accumulative, coherent under chosen lens. One meaningful deepening: realization that “rest was merely a pause” precedes final crescendo, foreclosing withdrawal option. Cost (exhaustion, relinquished tool) visible, but price could be sharper—hence stops just below 8-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can anything grow after the last burn?—tightens when the chant aligns the clock and the archive blooms: the guard forfeits his shield of dreamlessness as seeds of light fall. Escalation is accumulative-textural rather than causal-reversal, but the cadence shift from frozen stasis to reverse-ticking waves makes the cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“listen or stay deaf to inner wilderness”—is signaled early; escalation is density-driven rather than option-narrowing, but the final engine-breath visibly reweights the stake with light-veined cost. No concrete trade-off is dramatized; wonder accumulates, yet the philosopher sacrifices nothing tangible, keeping the tension just shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming dormant courage—signals early and tightens only imagistically; no live option is foreclosed until she steps into the cave. Escalation is accumulative: each inlet deviation adds lyric density rather than narrowing practical choices. Visible price is present yet mild—she gives up the dog-leash tether and accepts an undefined future. The pattern is coherent under Accumulative lens; a single moment where refusal carried palpable loss would have pushed 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“is safety worth eternal silence?”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: amber → copper discoloration literalizes the cost. Agency is collective and contemplative rather than active; no reversible option is closed, only emotionally re-priced. Suitable for accumulative/textural lens but lacks a visible personal forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“unmask pretender”—signaled early; each ink reveal narrows physical and moral options until only crown-confrontation remains. Sundering is protagonist-triggered with immediate spatial cost (collapse). Cost is visible but abstracted through temple metaphor; lacks a concrete personal loss beyond mission completion. Still, agency and escalation cohere under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode why marine paths vanish—tightens when the watermark-canyon link offers a restorable compass. One meaningful deepening: sea-level rise forecasts echo the old map, fusing archival and future loss. Agency is attentional—assemble, listen, correlate—rather than external action, fitting accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: the reef’s silence is now legible as navigational amnesia, foreclosing the comfort of mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: transform lull into living rebellion without burning it down. Pressure escalates via density increase—hum layers, dust spirals, engines cough—rather than tactical trade-off. The protagonist’s agency is listener-as-trigger, not negotiator or saboteur; cost is collective, not personal. Coincidence (stone responds to whisper) complicates; it does not resolve, but the lack of a visible personal price keeps escalation conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—community’s future via implanted destiny—signaled early; pressure source is communal witness more than personal jeopardy. Single tightening: amber opens, destiny binds; cost (lost lullabies) is summarized, not dramatized, weakening visceral trade-off. Agency is ritual completion rather than contested decision; no live option is foreclosed on-page. Escalation is tonal/ritual, meets Accumulative lens; meets 600-word threshold but lacks visible price to breach 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will she stay frozen in trauma or risk renewed engagement—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each gust, scent, and gull call layers density until the “pearl” swells; this deepening reweights the stake without external plot reversals. Cost is visible: she steps toward the precipice while still clutching the damaged photo, foreclosing retreat into pure detachment. Agency is present but lyrical; a single meaningful intensification meets the 800-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can fragmented reality become canvas?—is signaled early and tightens as each card re-arranges itself, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accretive: every untangled thread narrows exit until descent becomes the only active choice. Agency remains with Elian; coincidence (cards moving) complicates rather than rescues. Cost is felt: daylight lost, old self symbolically burned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—“why time slows in crisis”—is signaled early; pressure deepens as the ink patterns literalize the pause. Escalation is purely imagistic, not tactical: no option narrows, no resource is lost. The cost is conceptual (collective breath) rather than personal, so the tightening stays atmospheric, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    A single dominant stake—break the archives’ silence versus preserve frozen peace—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the sigil ignites. The reversal is network-driven, not Maren’s second action, so agency feels diffused; the cost is societal, not personal on-page. Pressure accumulates via cascading whispers rather than a second explicit trade-off. Escalation is textural and coherent, but the absence of a visible price paid by Maren herself caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can quiet gentleness anchor a fractured settlement? Pressure escalates through iterative reinforcement acts: whisper→rose thorns outward→scrap ballast→petal compass. Each act is protagonist-originated and narrows the future toward communal vow. Cost is felt but not catastrophic—appropriate to lyric mode—yet could be sharper (no one loses a tangible resource). The final tightening lands when the elder accepts the scrap’s story burden, foreclosing amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“catch the echo of a goddess”—is signaled early but remains metaphorical; no concrete narrowing of options or visible forfeiture. Escalation is textural: density of nocturnal images intensifies rather than tactical choices. Agency is receptive (listen, trace, accept) without trade-off or price on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the ledger or the city stays complicit”—is announced early; pressure escalates only once, when the console accepts the nib and projects the lattice. The tightening is intellectual (hypothesis proven) rather than physical or social; no resource is spent, no door slammed shut. Consequently the cost is conceptual, legible but abstract; the absence of a tangible price keeps the escalation below the 8+ band where visible cost is required.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silence personal guilt—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each sonic layer (beetle wing, recorder loop, city lullaby) deepens density until the final hush reweights guilt into communal caretaking. Amber-handwritten-tether acts as one persistent constraint that shapes tactics; visible price is Lyra’s eternal vigil. No coincidence; pressure coheres under accretive design.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can she turn fragmented echoes into coherent meaning—signals early and tightens through each sand spiral. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tile’s ripple of silence spreads, foreclosing the option to keep the unease; curiosity becomes calm with lilac peace as visible price. No external antagonist or reversal, but under Accumulative lens the intensifying hush suffices. Cost is atmospheric, not personal, keeping pressure poetic but slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can empathy survive rebuilt logic?—is declared early and tightened once: the stone demands a syllable that fuses warmth and steel. The rename act is the single decisive turn that forecloses nostalgia and opens the aberrant-mercy era. Pressure is situational/lyric: no antagonist, but cultural grief and cold logic press until the mosaic offers its contract. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than personal, yet visibly alters tactics (pilgrims bring their own chipped stones), satisfying the 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake—mend the fractured timeline through echo-performance—is signaled early and never diluted. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: density of color-sound thickens until apples burst into notes; options narrow only in the sense that the ghost must surrender the last echo. The shopkeeper’s wish supplies the external hinge, but agency remains the ghost’s release of song. Price is atmospheric—his essence diffuses into the orchard’s hum—felt but not tangibly lost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can she trigger telepathic recall without the pill? Pressure tightens through successive light-pulse iterations; each failure risks another static shock. The final “faint whisper” is not luck but the culmination of her fractal trials; options narrow to publish or suppress, and she chooses exposure—cost is the loss of sole ownership of her neural pattern. One meaningful escalation suffices; no external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—is signaled early; pressure escalates by accretion of sensory data, not narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the leaf’s ascent is culmination, not sacrifice. Cost is conceptual (perpetual solitude as amplifier), but because the map maker never hesitates or risks loss, the tightening is gentle, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode prophecy or time stays scrambled—is signaled early and tightens once: the echo-jar demands buttons to speak. Escalation is Accumulative: each matched button increases sonic density until the warehouse roars. Price is conceptual rather than visceral; no personal injury or social loss is risked, so cost stays legible but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—locate and claim “unused courage”—is declared early; pressure is lyric (accumulating snow patterns, vials drunk) rather than rising external jeopardy. No tightening reverses options; instead, symbolic map reveals goal was internal, producing conceptual reweighting. Agency remains steady but low-risk: tracing snow, drinking vial, following melt-stream—no beat forces a trade-off with visible consequence. Fits Accumulative/Textural lens yet stays below high-band because cost never turns acute or constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—riverside ritual succeeds or fails—signaled early, but pressure stays ambient; no option narrows and no price threatens. Escalation is cadence only: gutters tick, then cease; fog thins. Agency is receptive contemplation; serenity arrives as gift, not earned trade-off. Sufficient for lyric mode, yet too gentle to foreclose paths or raise cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can kindness re-start irrecoverable time?—tightens when the lantern’s glow becomes contingent on her continued benevolence, foreclosing passive observation. Escalation is textural: each sun-pattern traced adds another shard of past to the lattice until the hum reachesaudible pitch and hive pores open. Visible price: she surrenders the lantern—permanent loss of personal light for communal pulse. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“darkness will not claim the harbor’s heart”—is signaled early and escalates by density, not twist. Each planted vine incrementally raises the ante until the final image reweights safety for the entire waterfront. Agency is present but gentle: her only decisive act is the first latch-click; after that the vines grow by moon physics, muting visible cost. A sharper tightening midpoint would have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing societal fracture via sonic interference—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each new broadcast layer thickens the communal hum rather than narrowing live options. The solar-flare false alarm tightens once, but its neutralization is summarized off-stage, blurring visible cost. No tangible resource lost or path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key to fight forgetting—tightens when each spatial betrayal narrows exit options; the organ’s chord escalation forces the final mutiny. One meaningful deepening: the corridor’s sigh shifts claustrophobia into wistful rebellion. Cost is visible: the explorer’s vow to map and share forecloses personal secrecy. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence complicates (organ awakens) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—giving the vanished names back to air—is clear and poetic, but pressure escalates only atmospherically: mist thickens, stone cracks. Mara’s agency is entirely interior; she never faces a live dilemma or trade-off. Because no option is ever foreclosed, the cost feels conceptual rather than felt, capping escalation at the lyric threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—honor ancestor by securing the nail—is signaled early and tightened when the vortex threatens destruction; embedding the nail forecloses retreat. Pressure is situational rather than causal, but coherent: storm intensifies, crew must choose symbolic v. survival. One visible cost: the nail is lost to concrete, its mobility sacrificed. No antagonist or reversal, but sufficient escalation for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—turning “never” into possible photograph—signals early and escalates by accretion of echo, flutter, pixel. One meaningful tightening: the sky literally splits, spilling amber that forces the exposure beat. Cost is conceptual (amnesty now portable), but no live option is foreclosed for the fiddler; he gains vocation without visible forfeiture, keeping pressure shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—loop vs. new horizon—is signaled early and tightens when Arlen dissuades Maya, foreclosing creative-route expansion; the startup’s crash then externalizes that cost. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each pinned bill narrows the map’s possibility space. Visible price is legible (foreign notes left fluttering after crash), though the beat is brief. A mid-scene micro-reversal—Maya’s protest met by calm refusal—suffices for this length; no further reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode temple before doubt fractures her—signals early. Escalation is textural: each star-pulse thickens the pattern, deepening rather than narrowing options. Agency is present—she aligns, whispers, records—but the tightening is a soft luminosity, not a hard trade-off. Cost is conceptual (solitude → shared covenant) rather than tangible loss; visible price is faint, holding the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest collective longing into a beacon—is signaled early and tightens when the maze parts only after she maps scars. Escalation is textural: each hedge memory thickens the air until the portal offers a single path. Cost is conceptual—she binds herself to every forgotten grief—visible in the ground tremor and scar fade. No option is foreclosed, but the trade-off is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can haunted ambition be transmuted into living knowledge—tightens once: the seed’s sprout proves the bridge works, foreclosing her retreat into mere archiving. Pressure grows via density increase rather than external antagonist; each aligned leaf adds visceral evidence that the spirit’s departure can still be conversed with. Cost is legible in the arbor’s loss of harmony particles—finite resource now gifted to the clouds. Slight reserve: the stakes are conceptual; a sharper personal stake (memory of a beloved she failed to translate) could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete resource (time, scroll-memory, social credit) is at risk. Pressure deepens only imagistically (gears soften, water teal-shifts) rather than narrowing tactical options; the librarian never faces a forced trade-off between preserving stories and preserving self. The smelting scene is described, not dramatized with beats of failure or cost. Escalation is atmospheric, sufficient for Accumulative lens, but lacks a visible price that alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—turn abandoned grief into communal light—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through color shifts and pearl brightening. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lavender surface confirms hope summoning, narrowing Mara’s task to naming the lost. Agency is contemplative rather than tactical; the cost is borne by the collective, not her solitary body, keeping visible price gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“to find the library of unspoken words”—is declared in line 3 and tightens through each decoding beat; the propagation-delay map is the single meaningful intensifier that forecloses error. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the price is that once a petal is plucked and voiced, its luminous irreversibility is felt. No secondary antagonist is needed; the library’s own cipher applies coherent pressure. Agency is attention and documentation; the choice to inhale the golden blossom is the stance crystallization that ends the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“dream vs empire”—is declared early and tightened exactly once when the violin/coffee reading forces Elara to broadcast vine-dissent rather than accept annexation. Agency is present but light: her decisive act is to “weave their whispers into the violin’s song,” a sonic tactic that persuades off-stage power. Cost is legible: the empire’s envoy lowers his sword, the city gains autonomy, Elara keeps her mulberry ache—trade-off acknowledged. Pressure plate is single yet sufficient for 700-word scope; could enter 8.5+ if the envoy’s test were on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—save final spark—signaled early; pressure is existential but static. No reversal or trade-off: she succeeds on first attempt, aurora obligingly dims. Escalation is aesthetic (brighter flare) rather than tactical; options never narrow. Cost is cosmic, not personal—felt but not re-weighted to her immediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment via forgiveness—is signaled early; pressure grows through sensory accumulation rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening: sunrise alignment instantaneously reweights care-taking as its own reward, foreclosing vengeance. No visible resource lost; cost is opportunity-cost of abandoning retribution, felt but not articulated on-page. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens yet remains singular; no second pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—nuance vs certainty—tightens once when the knot loosens and the chimes shift to a softer tone; protagonist agency is present yet internal, cost is legible in the magistrate’s wavering gaze; sufficient for length, though escalation is single-crest.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—transform the curse into teachable vanishing—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via pattern accumulation rather than options narrowing; the grotto’s mirror is the first concrete test, offering a conceptual rather than tactical reversal. Cost is conceptual (she must accept perpetual disappearance-in-appearance), but not viscerally felt on-page; no resource is forfeited. Escalation is textured, not causal; sufficient for length, but not charged enough to breach 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“navigate without moving”—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when the arrowhead’s resonance offers the sole means; failure equals eternal wandering. Escalation is accumulative: each echo layer, bird spiral, and glow pulse deepens the cost of stillness. The final stance crystallizes options: internal map vs. physical exit. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but visible price (glowing arrowhead dimming) is subtle, not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove the worth of quiet brilliance—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens when the mist thickens and each step “releases a quiet sigh,” forcing a public-private test of legitimacy. Escalation is textural-density rather than causal reversal, but the cadence shift from cold monument to breathing spire visibly reweights options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the keystone scatters unmeasurable light, forfeiting council acclaim forever; this is legible and tied to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—translate sound to color—never faces external opposition or real risk of failure; pressure is aesthetic, not tactical. Escalation is achieved through intensifying visual density (single teal chord revelation) rather than narrowed options; no live choice forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (he now carries the sigil-map) but not viscerally felt; stakes remain abstract. Agency is observational: he inserts key, opens book, receives ribbon—no trade-off, no visible price. Enough for mid-7 band under Accumulative lens, but not the 8.8+ that demands a felt price on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will Silas find alignable purpose before the universe folds?—tightens via each decoded pop that forecloses ignorance. One meaningful deepening: the ribbon of light through cracked amber makes retreat impossible, price is the deck’s integrity. Agency is attention/interpretation rather than physical combat, yet each static burst is a proactive decision that narrows options. Cost legible: the deck fractures, void whispers in, stellar doubt turns to quiet certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—name the nameless fears—tightens with each crystalline verse; options narrow as remaining crystals dwindle. The act of naming visibly costs psychic weight, foreclosing endless mourning. Accumulative escalation coherent: each new name = denser resonance + lighter monster = brighter aurora. No coincidence; agency pure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—the river’s silence after the last fish—tightens when droplet irregularity threatens the bell repair; failure equals permanent cosmic hush. Escalation is accumulative: irregular drip → steady pulse → bell resonance → fish return; each phase reweights the stake without external coincidence. Visible price: the mage’s fragile devotion nearly shatters when early drops refuse to steady. Cost is legible on the page in the cracked bell’s memory of storm.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—replace myth with truth—tightens once when the bottle photo fuses label to sabotage story, forcing Caitlyn to speak. Cost is communal catharsis, not personal loss; escalation is poetic deepening rather than option foreclosure, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—bind reason to reverence—signals early and deepens when each sensory layer (crystal hiss, fresco revelation, shard scatter) tightens the cost of failure: lifelong aloofness. Agency is cumulative-textural rather than causal-plot: she endures each intensifying image, then acts by arranging the spiral and kissing the shard, foreclosing pure rationalism. The price is visible—she tearlessly accepts sentimental awe, a stance shift with social cost for an alchemist. One escalation beat suffices for 700-word scope; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“preserve trust under pressure”—is signaled early and tightens when the rope must hold lives. Revision sequence is the single meaningful deepening that narrows option from abstract duty to concrete knot. Pressure is coherent but plateau-locked; no secondary reversal raises cost after the storm cue. Cost is legible in the buckle bite, satisfying the 8-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore feeling—is signaled early and tightened when the blade actually cracks containment; options narrow from “guard or free” to “merge and share.” Factions supply external pressure, but their threat stays verbal; still, the protagonist’s agency drives the decisive turn and pays an on-page physical price.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is “can the seed bloom inside the game?”—pressure is situational, not personal for Mara. Escalation is accumulative: each solved cipher releases a puff of air; no option is foreclosed for Mara herself. Cost is borne by the flower, not the protagonist, so tension stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and narrows to one irrevocable tactic: keep pulling until silence sings. Escalation is textural: each blower pulse thickens sonic density, reweighting grief into audible joy. The visible price is the conductor’s vanishing (exit from mourning), paid on-page. Coincidence absent; pressure coils under own agency. Sufficient for length, though a second tightening beat could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: guardian’s loneliness vs. embracing uncertainty; pendant arrival tightens this by offering friendship-with-risk. One meaningful escalation: absorbing garden desolation into memory (interiorizing exteriors) reweights uncertainty from threat to ally, narrowing future choices to perpetual curatorship. Cost is visible—pendant warmth fused into flesh, eternal vigil. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational/timeless. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than combat, fitting Accumulative lens. No off-stage resolutions; dawn arrival is environmental coincidence that complicates, not solves.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—faces escalating tests: each failed ignition forecloses prior recipe and the penny-drop countdown deletes slack time. The midpoint spiral of ember-light is a visible price that reconfigures night, forcing him to confront the possibility that creative destruction may destroy him too. Agency remains causal: every tincture tweak is his, every spark refusal is met by deeper pulverizing of ash. The cold-flame climax narrows options to perpetual custodianship—he wins authorship of future but must tend a paradoxical fire that burns without warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove decay can birth signal—tightens once: static hiss → melodic chord. No antagonist; pressure is lunar perigee + city entropy. Cost is visible: Selin relinquishes the fragment, tower relinquishes dormancy, villages relinquish shadow. Agency is attention/renunciation under Accumulative lens; escalation is density surge, not causal turn, satisfying one meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent future ferry disappearances—is signaled late (paragraph 4) and remains abstract; the tightening is the visual of sand rising, but Lio’s agency is passive (whispering wish, not executing a risky tactic). Pressure is situational-lyric: atmosphere compounds rather than narrows options. Escalation is decorative—more glow, more mist—without visible price or trade-off. Closure reweights the world but not the protagonist’s live options; hence barely clears the 7.0 floor.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can abyssal minds read starlight—signals early and tightens only once, at the silent launch that “exhaled a collective sigh of somber marvel.” That single cadence shift is beautifully audible, but it is the only visible price; no alternate path is foreclosed, no resource lost, no scholar forced to choose between dogma and data. Pressure accumulates through repetition of light/lattice/anchor rather than rising contradiction, so the cost feels ambient, not personal. Because escalation is textural not causal, the story meets the Accumulative lens yet stays one tightening short of higher-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—protect vulnerable voices—signaled early. Escalation is textural: pulses thicken, choir resonance intensifies, photo colors restore. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than confrontation; cost is conceptual resonance, not tangible loss. Tightening deepens mood but does not foreclose live option; still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“stand by the unremembered” via codex map—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when phase arrays awaken and misstep threatens void crush. Agency is present: she aligns book, whispers protocol, activates return, buries codex—each action forecloses safer options. Cost is the permanent burial, visible on page, satisfying the lens. No second reversal, but single deepening suffices at this length; escalation is steady if not fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim her living status from digital death—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via pattern-deepening: ink sigils, shard resonance, ghost whispers—each adds density rather than new external obstacles. The tightening is perceptual, not option-narrowing; she never risks real failure or forfeiture. Cost is conceptual (awareness of systemic flaw) not visceral, keeping it under 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake = save the language from mute death; signaled in line 3. Escalation is cadence-based: each bird-loop tightens the echo-tunnel’s hum, narrowing options until only the fracture-release can complete the lexicon. Protagonist agency = tracing the spirals and cracking the diamond; luck never intervenes. Cost is the irreversible sealing—once the note falls, the new tongue is entombed in bone, a price legible in the final silence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“coax creature’s sorrow into laughter”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: phone laughter shifts from mournful to mischievous, reweighting stakes. Agency is receptive (listening, placing arrowhead) rather than active, but aligns with accumulative design. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical; options narrow toward communion rather than confrontation, satisfying the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—re-awaken beauty vs. mechanical order—is signaled early and tightens once when the bronze statue confronts; the tightening works by texture accumulation rather than option foreclosure, sufficient under Accumulative lens. A visible price (shell cracked, golden swarm released) is legible, yet the statue’s surrender feels synchronous rather than a new complication that raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—fragile peace across a drone-patrolled border—tightens once when the storm flash blinds the sentry, forcing Milo to act. The price is legible: the bottle’s emptied storm equals spent leverage, foreclosing repeat performance. No reversal, but one meaningful escalation satisfies the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Mara translate absence into motion before the train’s silence ossifies? Escalation is textural—each stanza layers denser fog, brighter gleam, more stubborn gears. Mid-point tightening: hidden compartment reveals the map that names the oasis a waypoint, not a destination, foreclosing escape. Cost is felt: she descends alone, halo surrendered, voice now permanently tethered to the engine’s breath.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“will dormant memories re-emerge”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the scarf’s ripple becomes visible to patrons, shifting browsing from solitary to communal. Yet the tightening is external; Mara makes no decisive trade-off, and the cost is ambient rather than personally paid, capping escalation short of high band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is declared early; escalation is textural (each dawn photo thickens the tapestry). No tightening reverses a live option; the filament escape is luck-like, not a choice that forecloses paths. Cost is conceptual (shared longing) rather than a tangible loss on-page. Pressure remains coherent within the accumulative lens but never spikes to a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—liberate an idea from fear—remains coherent. Escalation is textural: star-cues, path-shifts, ribbon-glint tighten the lyric pressure rather than causal reversals. The filament’s release reweights stakes for future travelers, not the locksmith, so cost is conceptual rather than personal. Sufficient intensification for 600-word lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recover village memories—signals early; pressure is atmospheric (decay, salt, rust) rather than narrowing options. No visible resource lost or path foreclosed; success arrives as revelation, not trade-off. Escalation reads as density increase of image, not tightening of choice. Cost is communal nostalgia, felt but not paid by protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will the library stay exiled?”—tightens via each decoded leaf pattern; the pentagon’s appearance forecloses retreat and forces the final alignment; cost is legible as the shadow’s destruction, though pressure escalates only once, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake—preserve wonder—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed for the pruner until the traveler arrives, and even then the gift is effortless. Escalation is accretive: each sunrise adds hue, storm adds rain-glyphs, but these intensify texture rather than tighten choice. A visible price—fatigue, risk, relinquished seed—would have lifted this above 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—quiet the drowned spirits—signals early; pressure escalates through sensory dimming and starlight fade, a textural deepening that reweights cost; no external opposition or reversal, but ritual fidelity supplies sufficient tension; cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can empathy re-open the sealed boundary—tightens once: the moment map and footage bleed together, foreclosing the option to leave the tear unexplored. Agency is intellectual (attention, alignment) yet carries felt cost: she is “trembling,” speaks to emptiness, ends alone recording. No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues through pattern density—rain, cracked stone, glyphs—until silence itself becomes the adversary. Cost is visible but not irrevocably priced; hence entry to 8.8+ remains just shy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the last transmission—tightens as each filament surrender releases a literal voice from the past. Pressure escalates by pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the accumulative lens; each snapped wire = one clearer word of the captain’s love. Cost is felt: the globe must shatter to complete the release, paying the price of preservation. One notch below 8.8 only because the tightening is poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—give the ghost a felt voice—tightens across three lightning beats, each forcing a costlier blossom pressed into dwindling supply. Agency is accumulative: the balladeer’s steady encoding is the only bridge, and each iteration forecloses one more flower/temporal slot. Cost is legible; could edge higher if a mid-scene micro-reversal (doubt, near failure) had flashed.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—signaled early; escalation is accretive, not causal. Pressure widens lyrically (nimbus weeps silver) but never narrows live options; no tactic is foreclosed, no resource lost. Cost is tonal, not tactical; closure reweights meaning without altering possibility space. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but barely audible as tangible stake-test.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mirror the sky before demolition—signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each coin-notched interval. One meaningful deepening: the recognition that limits are thresholds, not walls, crystallized when she presses the coin into wet pigment, narrowing options to final stroke or surrender. Cost is visible: the mural’s shimmer exists only while the building falls, a fleeting foreclosing of escape. Agency remains interior yet decisive; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“harness stranded luminance without draining life-force”—is signaled early; escalation is the stepwise chalking of squares that progressively tightens risk. Agency is creative, not combative; each new phrase and chalk line narrows options toward the final sync. Cost is implied rather than visceral: engine hum steadies but no lamp dims or crewmember staggers, keeping pressure lyrical rather than lethal. Still, the tightening pattern under the Accumulative lens is coherent and sufficient for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“mend broken time”—is signaled early and tightens once: the silent gears demand a key, foreclosing retreat. The deepening is textural: each mirror adds epochal snowflake-clocks until the heartbeat gear crystallizes. Cost is legible: the locksmith accepts eternal itinerancy (“vanished among the clouds”) as price for the restored rhythm. No reversal, but under Accumulative lens the density shift suffices; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—shared survival of hope—peaks with the bell’s chime, narrowing future options to seasonal repetition. Tightening is single but meaningful: droplet → resonance → light bloom. Cost is visible fatigue and water spent; agency is collective yet present. Could edge higher if one villager faced a personal forfeit, but communal model is coherent under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—pause the world’s ticking—is signaled in line 1 and deepened when each dial revolution narrows options toward a single breath. Escalation is accumulative/textural: nested patterns thicken until the hush coils viscerally around her heart; the cost is the sea’s hammering rhythm syncing with her own pulse. No antagonist is required; pressure is situational and cosmo-lyric. The tightening beat is the pane thickening to veil—an irreversible trade-off that forecloses future adjustment of the clock.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers—signaled early; night-frost clock tightens once. Escalation is accretive: each reed trace thickens pattern until nut-glow reverses frost. Cost is conceptual: orchard remains cursed, caretaker’s exile renewed. Agency sits in the placing of nut; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: redeem the failed chrysalis by discovering a bridging mechanism. Pressure tightens when the foam pattern offers a live template yet demands she abandon sterile lab control. One visible cost: she forfeits professional distance, kneels in river mud, hair soaked, reputation still at risk if the reed-bridge collapses. Escalation is textured, not causal-reversal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stake is legible: transform unquantified absence into generative light. Pressure escalates by iterative tightening—each counted void brightens the bottle, intensifying stakes until the final incision releases all stored light, foreclosing the vendor’s original quest. Cost is conceptual but felt: the bottle empties, his purpose atomized into perpetual library chorus. Agency is present yet cerebral; physical risk or loss would sharpen the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is release of collective remorse; pressure escalates imagistically—cold intensifies, cracks widen, brine droplets increase—rather than through a reversible choice. Single micro-turn: palm-through-arch flips chill to warmth, remorse dissolves; this is the only beat where protagonist action visibly alters stakes. Cost is atmospheric (fortress left “brittle,” ready to whisper-fracture) rather than personal/irrevocable, so escalation feels gentle. Agency is present but ritualized; no live option is surrendered, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—heal the city’s scars through song—tightens once when the first polyglot chime converts elevator drone into chorus; options narrow from solitary librarian vs. silent silos to united civic voice. Cost is legible: she spends her hoarded linguistic weight (brass + languages) in one night, ending with empty hands and a hoarse tower. Agency is accumulative rather than confrontational, fitting the lyric mode. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is the void itself.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: bridges built from song literalize the idea that shared art can repair industrial rupture. The cuckoo weight’s return reframes time from mechanical metronome to compassionate heartbeat—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. No character utters a moral; the final image (city breathing as one) answers the thematic question sensorially. Ambiguity lingers: will the songs survive daylight? Complexity embraced without forced equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“catalog abandoned dreams”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when revival, not mere recording, becomes implied. Escalation is accretive: each mirrored shard rewires stone, tableau brightens, risk of fracture mentioned. Cost is conceptual (dreams fade again at dawn) rather than personal loss, keeping pressure legible but not visceral. Agency remains internal—she could walk away—so tension is moderate; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single dominant stake—recover forgotten combinations—is declared early and reiterated, but never complicated by rival desire or risk. Escalation is purely spectacular (floating columns, glyph flare) rather than tactical; no option is narrowed for Liora, only revealed. The hourglass of inverted gravity supplies urgency, yet she never races or improvises—just witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled early but never materially resisted; no crack refuses to sing, no porcelain threatens to shatter, no audience is imagined that might censure or reward. Escalation is iterative rather than tightened: each crack equals one more pretty note; danger plateaus. Tension accumulates texturally (grove “breathes empathy”) yet protagonist options never narrow. Thus pressure is atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the difficult”—is declared early; pressure escalates via pattern-recognition beats, not reversals. No live option is foreclosed until the rook seals the covenant’s rebirth; cost is conceptual, not visceral. Sufficient tightening for 600-word window, but barely touches 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—access hidden silences—signaled early; escalation is textural: each frequency layer thickens resonance until diary yields. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative density. Final fireworks act as cadence shift, not resolution, leaving silence-to-empathy transfer unfinished—cost felt but options not foreclosed. Sufficient tightening for 600-word scope, yet stakes remain cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are internal—will patience yield serenity?—but pressure is static: time passes, the shoot grows, scent shifts, bloom arrives without an on-page reversal or trade-off. The only “cost” is the wait itself, which is summarized rather than felt as forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is sensual (scent evolution) rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed, so escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is epistemic: can Mara locate and release the storm’s residual energy? Pressure escalates through accumulating data-curves; options narrow to the central tower. No external antagonist or reversible loss appears, so the price is opportunity-cost—she invests interpretive labor that could still fail—but the page never lets us feel that risk; success feels pre-ordained. Still, the singular convergence is tested on-page and reconfigured by her whispered command, satisfying minimal agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—keeping wonder alive inside frozen silence—is signaled immediately and reweighted by each aurora-soaked echo. Yet escalation is cumulative, not perilous: stakes deepen via density of color-sound rather than a narrowing option or visible loss; no beat forces the bell-ringer to risk or forfeit anything tangible, so cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guardianship must evolve or die—tightens when the seam offers “countless histories that had failed.” The driftwood path is the visible price: each piece is a physical stake driven into her old certitude. Final silence is renunciation-cost; she forfeits the loud song to seed quiet failure-insight. No coincidence; every escalation is her agency carving the path.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—prove emotion is quantifiable—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only texturally: inkings accumulate, the room glows brighter, but no choice narrows or forecloses an option. The fragment’s crack is a gift, not a cost she forces. No visible price alters her tactics; thus escalation feels observational rather than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“turn routine into wonder”—is declared early and each vignette delivers a micro-proof, producing a cumulative lift. Yet escalation is flat: no tighter squeeze, no forfeiture; the courier’s tactics never adapt and the pendant never falters, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—prove objects hold emotion—tightens when frost veins bloom and grief pulses; the cost is the traveler’s memory now loosed into world. Agency is crystalline: Liora’s alignment act, not luck, triggers every escalation. One more visible price (cracked prism facet, blood-warm glass) would push to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—send the bead’s message—is clear early. Tightening occurs when the filament’s stretch spends her glow, but the price is more lyrical than tactical; options were never visibly wide. Escalation is textural (density of light and sound) rather than causal narrowing; acceptable under Accumulative lens yet keeps score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—trade memory for future strength—is signaled early and tightened once when the tunnel demands the scar. Agency is present (he offers, he descends, he forges), but external pressure stays soft; no rival seeker, no collapsing shaft, so escalation is tonal, not tactical. The final crack-to-crystal moment re-weights the village ground, providing visible consequence, yet the price feels collective more than personal. A mid-shaft hallucination of the failed forge trying to pull him back would have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing the frozen crew by uncovering the evacuation lie—is signaled early and tightened when Lira realizes only the elite were saved. One meaningful deepening: the sealed log flickers into view only after she uses the shard to redirect sensory flow—this narrows her moral options to “break cycle or leave them frozen.” Cost is legible: shard’s destruction and the bay’s dissolution are the price of truth. Agency is continuous; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—bottle safety for anonymous sailors—emerges early; pressure deepens as each stone widens the spiral, but escalation is lyrical, not causal. No live option is foreclosed; the boat’s lantern is an echo, not a test. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—’shape a new dawn using ancient shadows’—is declared early but remains abstract; the tightening beat is the lantern-redirect, yet options were never visibly narrowed beforehand. Pressure accumulates imagistically rather than tactically; the newspaper’s fall is symbolic, not a resource loss that alters moves. Protagonist agency is present but reactive—she follows prophecy instead of forcing a trade-off. Cost is cosmic, not personal; the emotional price is gestured at, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—why stories magnetize—remains abstract; no concrete loss or narrowing of options is dramatized. Escalation is imagistic (scroll → loom → beacon) rather than a trade-off under pressure; the protagonist never confronts a live cost or antagonistic force. Agency is observational: she reads, smiles, whispers; the final illumination happens to the valley, not through a risk she takes. Pressure accumulates in density, not consequence, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting visceral stakes to mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“relieve the labyrinth’s sorrow”—is signaled early and tightens once: each traced dream thins a filament, softening the wind. The price is visible on-page: the last strand dissolves, Eli’s own grief lifts, tower quiets. Accumulative pressure under the chosen lens; no causal reversals needed. Missing a secondary loss (time, tool damage) that could sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are soft: existential forgiveness rather than external jeopardy. Pressure accumulates via atmospheric repetition—each riddle page hums—rather than narrowing options. The paradox invitation is a gentle dare, not a trap; refusal carries no visible price. The final insight is resonant but low-temperature; escalation is interior and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—rescuing meaning from slow erasure—remains stable; pressure accumulates via sensory density rather than option-narrowing, producing a soft tightening (night falling, loaf diminishing) rather than a trade-off with visible price; sufficient for length but not acute enough for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens once: the sky dissolving outside mirrors the risk that silence may never yield legible data. The protagonist’s agency is cerebral—each micro-adjustment of the device forecloses alternative frequencies—so the cost is conceptual rather than physical. A visible price is paid: the ledger pages now hum, a transformed artifact she must carry into a world whose illusions have already faded. Escalation is single-curve, but the final reweighting of silence into map is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the tunnels lit without breaking the no-gunfire truce—tightens when the scout cracks the lock; Lila’s lantern-toss is a decisive narrowing of options that trades visibility for survival. Agency drives escalation: her false-start rehearsal enables the vapor decoy and the blackout gambit. Sunrise supplies visible price; the truce expires with the dawn she ushers in, perpetual conflict foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding weather carriers—remains abstract; the tightening is a shift in atmospheric taste, not a narrowing of live options. Agency is observational: tasting, watching, recording; no tactic is altered by a visible loss or tool forfeiture. Escalation is textural (sweet→sour→sweet metallic) and works under Accumulative lens, but the absence of a personal cost keeps the score sub-8. Closure reconfigures meaning, not tactical space.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“uncork suppressed creativity”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the lock rejects every prior attempt; the mirror tactic is a last-resort trade-off. Escalation is Accumulative: each charcoal layer increases density until sorrow liquefies into ink, forcing the final要么 filament stroke. Cost is visible: she forfeits emotional insulation, exits bearing the cave’s imaginative weight. No coincidence; all pressure is internalized and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“truth vs. societal dishonesty”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens exactly once when the council demand arrives. The plate’s graying makes the cost visceral, but the escalation is singular; no second reversal tests her commitment deeper. Agency is present (she descends, whispers), yet the final conduit image feels slightly convenient rather than a forced narrowing of options. Sufficient for the 600-word frame, but another mid-story trade-off would have nudged this into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled immediately, yet pressure is atmospheric, not agonistic: wind cooperates, neighbors watch admiringly, no resource or time limit narrows options. The single “tightening” is iterative maintenance, a ritual deepening rather than a trade-off with visible price. Escalation is cadence-based: each sunrise adds another layer of glint to the accrual; this satisfies Accumulative lens but keeps stakes conceptual. No live reversal or forfeiture is dramatized, so tension stays muted.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent destructive burn while salvaging her own static—is signaled early and tightened when the shield flickers. The single meaningful turn is the decision to miniaturize inner chaos into the box; this narrows options because failure would lose both the roses and her last anchor to feeling. Visible price: the box is planted, no longer accessible. Pressure stays causal, not coincidental; escalation is modest but sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove listening heals—surfaces early and tightens through each letter read; the option of silence is foreclosed as more whispers arrive. Escalation is density-driven rather than causal-turn, but the accumulation of names (librarian, baker, runaway) raises communal cost; the final bench exhibit crystallizes the trade-off. No external antagonist, yet internal pressure against city noise suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieving deleted memories—tightens once: spiral match triggers slab sigh and memory release; options narrow to “lift or leave.” Cost is conceptual (memories now ride her lantern), visible in brighter flame. Escalation is single but meaningful under Accumulative lens. Could reach 8.8+ if a second gravity fluctuation had threatened to scatter the fragments, sharpening risk.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are declared early—celestial rupture—and tighten when glyphs spiral outward, showing the quiet lattice must hold or sky tears. One meaningful deepening: the wing’s rising glow signifies the firmament is now tethered to her breath; failure would snap that thread. Cost is atmospheric rather than corporeal—still water, dimmed fireflies—so urgency feels muted, not visceral. Agency is present—she chooses the final phrase—but the price is communal calm, not personal forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: decode stone murmurs without exposing the lie that scholarship is the real motive. Pressure escalates texturally—each meteor streak increases the sense that cosmic and masonry languages are converging, raising the social cost of being caught lying. No decisive reversal, but a deepening: when the seal is traced, the pact of agreed-upon lies becomes the only medium of truth, narrowing future options to continued complicity. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the protagonist forfeits empirical proof for lived, endless translation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared—translate isolation into independence—but isolation is never threatened or tested on-page; no external force tries to stop her archiving, so pressure is purely atmospheric. One micro-turn: seashell’s silence at sunrise signals completion, yet this is signaled, not driven by her agency. No credible loss (time, tool, social credit) is risked or paid. Escalation is poetic density increase, not option narrowing; under Acculative lens this is acceptable, but the absence of visible cost keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—trading forged perfection for forgiveness of the unfinished—is signaled early and holds. Pressure is ambient (drip, twilight) rather than intensifying; no beat narrows options or raises visible price. The conflict is internal and static; the thorn’s glow is affirmation, not test. Closure is lyrical reconfiguration, not decision under duress, so escalation remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“why do people echo?”—is declared early; pressure escalates via cumulative reveal of unfinished promises. No live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual rather than tactical, so tension plateaus rather than tightens. Still, the lattice projection is a visible price that reframes prior echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—“to salvage something pure from the wreckage”—are declared early; pressure tightens when the lattice of dreams sharpens into a physical vapor window, foreclosing the option to remain passive. The whisperer’s agency drives every beat: she records, maps, whispers, embeds, places palm. Cost is legible in the cold melt that enters her skin and the starlight that solidifies in her veins. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length; escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—appreciation of hidden effort—is declared early but never materially tested; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The only narrowing is the philosopher’s promise to keep returning, a stance crystallization without external obstacle. Escalation is textural: firefly swarms, moon paths, and cricket choruses intensify mood, not jeopardy. Sufficient for lyric mode, but lacks the on-page cost or trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—“find the stillpoint or remain buried in corporate lies”—tightens through each salvaged scrap; every fragment recovered forecloses retreat. The stillpoint’s revelation is both escalation and resolution, a one-turn design permissible at this length; cost is the lifelong guardianship she accepts at dawn. No coincidence resolves; the diamond’s inscription merely crystallizes what the pattern has earned. Agency is pure: without her collage work, no map, no stillpoint, no sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—forge a new dawn from darkness—is declared repeatedly but never tested by competing options or potential loss. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (storm intensifies, drones sing) without forcing the visionary into a narrowing choice; the allegiance swells offstage. No visible price is exacted from him, so escalation reads as spectacle, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transmission of ancestral melody—signals early and intensifies as each jar forecloses silence. One meaningful tightening: handing a jar to the child sacrifices exclusive custodianship, a visible price. Escalation is textural (layered sounds) rather than causal reversals, valid under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (child arrives at loft) complicates but does not resolve, satisfying situational guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (“protect from weaponization”) are declared early and repeated, but the only on-page obstacle is the lock’s frequency puzzle, solved on the first attempt; no active seeker appears, so escalation is intellectual, not adversarial. Tightening exists—must match heartbeat to key—but the cost is time-and-sweat, not a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—sculpt patience from impatience—tightens via moon-tracking density; each nightly pass deepens pattern recognition until the humming apex forecloses the option to quit. Cost is visible: she forfeits her prior “restless yearning” and accepts the lake’s slower heartbeat. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preventing future drowning—signals early and tightens when the hidden conduit is revealed. Agency is observational-turned-interventional: data spikes → valve turn, foreclosing the neglect path. Cost is the groaning pipe and the protagonist’s exposed stance beneath the city, felt on page. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word window; no additional reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can contrition be engineered into a living rhythm? Escalation is one continuous mechanical tightener: dead heart → diagnosis → fresh spring → sun-fired ignition, each stage narrowing failure options. The chaplain’s agency is the brass rod insertion—one irreversible move that fuses soul and machine. Cost is visible: his heartbeat now answers to a clock he cannot fully control.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared—“ring an inaudible bell”—but no counter-force opposes Mara; the sea hisses yet never threatens, the gears merely applaud. Pressure is decorative; escalation consists of prettier lights, not narrowed choices or rising price. Absence of risk flattens the conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled early—“refuse to surrender its purpose to the cold silence”—and tighten as each mirror glimpse forecloses futures until the golden aura locks in renewal. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tool, stamina, or relationship is lost. The protagonist’s agency is present but friction-free; the shard essentially reassembles itself once the ritual is performed.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“hearing the sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via accumulative salvage dirges and wind hymns that reweight the narrator’s stance. No visible price (lost tool, social cost) is dramatized; the shift is internal and lyric, with cost implied rather than palpable. Escalation is cadence intensification, not option foreclosure; volunteer action supplies choral solace but no rising external obstacle. Agency remains observational; final acceptance is renunciation without external risk or forfeiture shown on page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can ash/soil dialogue redeem mismatched love? Pressure deepens through iterative parallels; each echo tightens the sentinel’s commitment to listening rather than fixing. No reversal, but a meaningful cadence shift—glow from the buried edge—signals stakes have been re-weighted. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of mismatch) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract: “preserve the echo of wisdom” is never threatened or limited; no resource is spent or path foreclosed. Escalation is purely atmospheric—stillness, shimmer, lullaby—rather than a narrowing of options. Cost is absent on the page; the Keeper leaves with the same calm he arrived with, so pressure feels decorative rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are announced—“transmute pain into a masterpiece”—but no tangible resistance materializes: no skeptic, no rainstorm, no shortage of pins or wall-space, no risk to Mara’s calm. Escalation is atmospheric (more villagers, more tears) rather than a narrowing of options; the photograph arcs brighten, yet this is spectacle, not jeopardy. The single micro-turn is the crowd’s arrival, which complicates nothing—it completes the plan. Without a forced trade-off or visible price, pressure plateaus at tender ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode language growth—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens when the crystal’s memory-rings foreclose the option of ever capturing it in print. One meaningful textural tightening: scattered glints cohere into legible lattice, narrowing her possible actions to testimony-by-page. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—capture aging’s sound—announced early. Pressure escalates texturally: each driftwood arrow, each forgotten vision tightens the loop of loss. Chalk-to-monolith moment deepens the stake by making forgetting audible. Cost is the sound itself—once recorded, it keeps eroding him; tactics altered by the need to externalize before total amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral spin into usable thrust—is declared early and re-asserted at every paragraph, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No visible price is risked: tools never break, hands never tremble, time never threatens penalty. The single “tightening” is serene, not desperate, so escalation is a slow luminosity increase rather than a narrowing of options. The leaf-echo beat supplies the required micro-turn, yet feels fated, not fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: craft a flawless goodbye for Mr. Harlan. Pressure escalates by accumulative deepening—each slow chord, breath alignment, and vinyl whisper heightens the stakes without external opposition. No reversal is required; the tightening is the deliberate elongation of time until the final exhale. The cost is legible: the shard is now warm, divided, and carried away—an irreversible transformation of the object and the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are legible from the first paragraph: solve the shadow riddle or remain haunted. Pressure escalates by pattern accumulation—each completed loop tightens the circuit—rather than external opposition, coherent with the Accumulative lens. A visible price is paid: the key winds down, the isle settles, shadows vanish into the core; the cost is felt but modest, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring a displaced soul—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: vertebra click → galaxy bloom narrows certainty into belief. The cost is conceptual (she shoulders an unasked-for cosmic burden) rather than tactile loss, keeping intensity lyrical but still felt. No antagonist or reversal beyond the single alignment moment; sufficient for 600-word lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform viral shame into gentle memory—tightens via textural accretion (stones → moss → code) rather than a single forked choice; the “honeyed hush” deepens perceptually but no option is foreclosed, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping cost legible but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—collect hopes against narrative current—signaled in line 1; tightening occurs when current tries to “pull her words away,” forcing anchoring ritual with shell. Escalation is textural: each cameo adds density until final child-whisper deepens cost. No off-stage resolution; protagonist’s agency (turn page, close notebook) crystallizes stance with felt cost. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—“restore sacred practices”—are declared, but the valley’s survival is abstract; no concrete loss or ticking malfunction pressures Mara. Escalation is tonal: hush deepens, light brightens, pollen falls; the vine’s response is cooperative, not resistive. Agency remains ritual facilitation rather than problem-solving under duress. The final covenant is restorative, not a trade-off that forecloses an option for Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can she bind starlight into a living map without losing it—or herself? Pressure escalates through each placement beat; the harmless sunrise flare is the visible tightening that forecloses failure—if the light scatters, the covenant dies. No outside antagonist needed; the conflict is patience vs. entropy, rendered as physical craft. The price is lifelong service, shown in the closing promise; cost is conceptual but undeniable, meeting the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harvesting wonder for later—signaled early and tightens once when the quartz insertion succeeds, narrowing options from “repair” to “store.” The visible price is the halted timer itself and the risk of losing echoes forever; the felt price is the paradox of imprisoning wonder without killing it, crystallized in the final redefinition. Under accumulative lens, density of reflected beams escalates until the single pulse reweights the stake. No coincidence; all pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—“unbind the boundary-lessly trapped sorrow”—is announced, not dramatized; pressure is ambient, not narrowing. No reversal or trade-off is demanded of the weaver; the lamp absorbs burdens friction-free. Escalation is recursive prettification (each statue sings) rather than option-limiting cost. The “still as the sea’s depth” clause gestures at risk but enforces no on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—convert absence into vessel—signals early and tightens once: sap hardens, foreclosing the option to carve deeper or start over. Agency is present (she presses the glass, lifts the lantern) but the price is conceptual (accepting silence) rather than a live option lost on the page. Pressure grows accumulatively; no coincidence or false cliffhanger. Enough for 8+ eligibility, yet the absence of a second viable path keeps it modest.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“trade regret for one true memory”—is signaled early and tightens exactly once when the ghost brightens at her offer. The price (permanent carry of strangers’ stories) is declared but not felt in a concrete later restriction; tactics don’t change after payment. Still, the swap is irreversible and frame-final, satisfying the lens. No false escalation or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—resurrect hope via equations—is signaled early and tightens once when she discovers the hidden schematic, forcing a fresh ethical calculus. However, no visible price (injury, energy drain, social risk) is dramatized; the power surge costs her nothing and the beacon’s possible consequences remain abstract. Escalation is present but weightless, so the beat fails the 8+ cost gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: can he bear the weight of his own sentimentality under guild-scorned rules? Pressure escalates by density: each recalled rain afternoon adds tonal weight until the crystal’s pulse forces the inscription choice. No external antagonist; the tightening is the moment he risks guild ridicule by carving memory instead of seconds. Cost is legible—he forfeits the safety of “exacting standards” and embraces permanent vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“dismantle the architecture of lies”—is signaled early and re-anchored at every ripple of water. Escalation is accumulative: each reflected spire exposes another layer of scaffolding until the sunrise re-prices the whole skyline. Agency resides in minute bodily acts (twist of dial, whispered promise) rather than external confrontation; cost is the lifelong labour of salvage he now accepts. The abstract antagonist (“lies”) never pushes back concretely, capping tension just below the visceral 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—is declared early but never materially threatened; no ticking clock or resource drain raises cost. The “tightening” is purely pattern-deepening (knot → constellation), not an option foreclosed. Atmospheric pressure thickens, yet the collector’s agency remains observation-only; escalation is lyrical, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure accumulates via density of absences; each whispered vignette tightens the stake—how many ungrieved names can one heart carry? The rose’s revival is the visible price: it blooms only because the traveler keeps writing, locking him into perpetual motion. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final image intensifies rather than releases the load.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—rekindle beauty—signals early but remains abstract until the bird appears; no intermediate tightening that forecloses a live option. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than because/therefore causality. The prince’s agency is assembling, yet no beat shows that failure would cost him anything concrete. Closure reweights the world conceptually, satisfying the lens, but the missing on-page price caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: prove scars can sing (transform generational fire-guilt into communal peace). Pressure deepens via sensory layering—sand warms, coin sings—rather than external opposition. One meaningful intensification at sunset when tone emerges; option space doesn’t narrow, but meaning reweights. Cost is symbolic (heritage exposure) more than practical; still legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens when hinges resist and glass sticks; the pause of geese is the live clock that narrows the moment. Escalation is textural: each breadcrumb adds density until the spill of lights reweights cost from private burden to public constellation. No visible price (blood, loss) but the empty box’s suddenly lighter weight signals forfeiture of her protective skepticism. Sufficient for 800-word lyric arc, though a sharper physical cost could punch higher.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—stays legible; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical, so escalation = resonance amplification rather than option foreclosure. The only narrowing is aesthetic: "garden mourned the loss of fire," but no live alternative path is sacrificed. Cost accrues as ancestral sorrow, felt conceptually; visible price would raise score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—render collective grief legible—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each butterfly wave and ribbon hue thickens the pattern, but Eliam’s agency is limited to observation and arrangement; no moment forces a hard trade-off or irreversible risk. The tightening is aesthetic, not tactical, so cost remains communal and conceptual rather than personal and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—“restore shared balance between humanity and tide”—remain conceptual; no concrete consequence is shown if Mara skips a sunrise, so pressure is ambient rather than acute. The only tightening is the pendulum pause, but it returns unchanged each day, producing iterative stasis, not escalation. Because no resource (time, tool, social credit) is risked or lost, cost is aesthetic rather than felt, keeping tension lyrical and low-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“shape of intentions”—is announced early but remains abstract; no visible price is paid or path foreclosed. Pressure accumulates imagistically rather than through narrowing options; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Because lens is Accumulative, this suffices, yet the lack of a trade-off keeps tension muted.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent famine—is declared early; pressure tightens when the model forecasts three threats, forcing the invention of frost-barley and aurora mirrors. Escalation is intellectual, not visceral; the cartographer’s personal risk never appears, so cost is social, not felt. Agency is continuous—each diagram stroke feeds the crystal—meeting causal-lens demand. Closure resolves the kingdom’s stake, not the protagonist’s, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can silence be broken without personal exposure—tightens when Mara decides to transmit the pirate song publicly; the shawl amplifies both sound and risk, a visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs as luminous ink accumulates: each copied bar heightens the chance of detection, narrowing her options to either hoard or broadcast. No reversals are needed; the accumulative pattern itself escalates atmospheric cost until the crowd’s listening crystallizes the stakes. Agency remains hers—she presses “play,” enduring the consequence of openness.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“crystallize a fleeting emotion before it dissolves”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates via density: each sprinkle thickens the air until the lattice forms. Agency is ritual, not overt conflict; the rocking-chair halt acts as a micro-turn that halts time and forces the final sealing whisper. Cost is conceptual but legible: the mask must be sacrificed, the powder lost, the gallery left changed. No live antagonist or reversal, yet the accumulative pressure satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving competing water-engineering memories—signals early and tightens when the cog’s sync forces a documentary choice. Escalation is one-step but sufficient for 700-word frame: sediment decoding → narrative convergence → cipher creation; the price is the narrator’s embrace of unresolved dual truth. Agency remains intellectual rather than physical; the final act is inscription, yet it forecloses simpler dogma. Cost is conceptual yet unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: salvage vanishing songs from final silence. Escalation is textural—each chord strips ambient noise, tension loosens shoulders; no causal reversal, but the deepening is legible. Cost is collective, not personal: the town’s hatred erodes, yet teacher’s private loss (world still “losing songs faster than seasons turn”) persists—visible conceptual cost. Agency is gentle—she invites, plays, endures—enough for Accumulative design but not a high-stakes crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—is signaled early and reweighted when the echo answer reframes hive failure as necessary silence. Escalation is a single cadence shift: riddle → key → light → echo; agency is mostly receptive, narrowing to acceptance rather than active gambit. Cost is conceptual (city’s voice returning) and felt in citizens’ lingering; a sharper tangible loss (time, safety, social credit) would deepen pressure. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is the amber revelation—enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“can silence sanctify without trap?”—is signaled early but never seriously endangered; the hush spreads unopposed. Escalation is a thickening of texture rather than a narrowing of options; no credible loss or reversal tests the narrator’s commitment. The elderly woman’s memory acts as confirmation, not complication. Cost is atmospheric (collective sigh) rather than personal, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake: restore fluid nuance to ossified myth. Pressure escalates only texturally—each cascade of memory deepens color and texture rather than narrowing physical options. No credible loss or tool forfeiture is dramatized; escalation is aesthetic, not tactical. Still, the accretive glow makes the cost of certainty feel increasingly stifling, so the dominant stake does tighten once through the pattern-shift.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    One dominant stake—prove perpetual motion or remain bound—is signaled early and tightens when the stairs first quiver. Escalation is purely causal: each roll tilts reality, narrowing option toward the final “quiet rupture.” The price is visible in the scar that never lands—then finally does—reconfiguring obsession into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—remains abstract until Jiro’s memory bloom, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; no option narrows for Mara. The courier’s return supplies a micro-turn that reweights the premise, enough for lyric-accumulative closure at this length. Cost is felt conceptually, not personally, preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—arts must revive or collective memory dies—is clear early, but escalation is largely atmospheric; deepening happens via color return, not narrowing options. No credible loss of time, tool, or social credit is dramatized. Coincidence (lens flash triggers door thaw) is permitted under Accumulative lens. Final narrowing is emotional—acceptance replaces dread—so pressure coheres, yet remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightens once: when the engine coughs, the maker could still retreat, but committing the key irreversibly fuses his life story to the island’s chronicle. Visible price paid: the stone dies, the maker vanishes, islanders inherit an unasked dawn. No antagonist needed; the conflict is causal—man vs. deterministic time—escalating through each gear ratio he decodes. The tightening is single but meaningful; only the absence of a mid-course reversal keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete personal loss is risked. Escalation is imagistic (luminance thickens, horse dissolves) rather than option-narrowing; Mara never faces a fork where failure costs her anything identifiable. Single tightening is the clasp placement, but its mechanical consequence is revealed rather than chosen. Cost is conceptual (eternal beacon) but not felt on-page because no prior ordinary life is established to lose.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake: prove obstacles can become instruments; tension equals volume of that proof. Escalation is density of musical conversion—each dub thickens texture—but no option is foreclosed, no failure risked, so cost feels aesthetic rather than consequential. Agency is present (he strikes, layers, bows) yet safe; nothing retaliates. The tightening is a cadence shift, not a narrowing of live choices; thus pressure is atmospheric, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent Shellhaven’s fossilization—faces concrete test when the mosaic glow reveals the out-tunnel; choosing to leave the city’s shell is a tightening with visible price (exposure to watchers). Escalation is causal: whistle → turtle stir → watchers’ light-pattern answer; each step narrows her options until endurance becomes the only stance. No coincidence resolves; the watchers’ answer is earned by her pattern-calls. Cost is legible in the final image: she seals the mosaic, accepting eternal vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue truth from lies—tightens once: the illuminated letter forces Arlen to decide whether to preserve the people’s hope-shield or break it. The tightening is driven by his agency (he lifts, reads, places the letter on the pedestal) and carries visible conceptual cost: “the noble lie dissolve[s], not as a betrayal but as a transformation.” No reversals are needed; one meaningful escalation under causal lens suffices. Price is felt: the station’s abandonment mirrors the kingdom’s myth, so dismantling the story risks repeating the station’s fate—truth may travel but the building remains derelict.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—rescue memory from oblivion—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each note deepens the pattern of loss rather than narrows options; the river’s slow swallow is the tightening. Cost is felt ink bleed staining vellum, but no live option is foreclosed—she can still return tomorrow. Sufficient for length, but lacks a tactical loss that would sharpen the final oath.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared early: trace honest origins. Mid-story tightening arrives when the flood-is-sacrifice hypothesis risks ridicule, but the council accepts it without resistance, flattening escalation. The vault descent carries personal stake—her reputation—but no visible price (time, breath, injury) is spent on-page. Final civic protection feels like gift, not hard-won cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“can he transmute private grief into communal light”—is signaled early and deepens through each polishing pass. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative: each crane folded is another gram of sorrow distilled, a soft but legible tightening. The shadow-detach moment acts as a living clock, forcing the ritual to begin, yet the text repeats this cue twice without new consequence, muting escalation. Cost is conceptual—grief “dissolves” rather than a tangible object lost—so the price is felt but not visible on the page, capping entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—tap the unused potential pool—signaled early and deepened by each resonance reading. Escalation is textural: each amplification of geode hum increases the intangible cost of merger. The final palm-thrust forecloses retreat; the price is the permanent fracture of the crystal and the implied surrender to a state of being. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices under accumulative lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: awakened minds can transmute unspent systemic energy into new being. No moralizing; final constellation image reweights earlier “map” motif. Subtext of personal vs. systemic loss is hinted but not fully braided. Ambiguity lingers—will he distribute shards or hoard them?—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“decode frequency of belonging”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when each star-trail step pulls the chip closer, narrowing failure option. Escalation is textural: density of light, hum, and chant layers until the lever pull forces trade-off between solitary discovery and communal song. Cost is conceptual but legible: Lira forfeits sole ownership by vowing to guard the chip for future pilgrims. No visible resource loss keeps it from 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will the exchange proceed or collapse—tightens once via the moon-phase deadline; the waning crescent forces the dawn handshake, foreclosing delay. No reversal, but the deepening mist and warming pull accumulate pressure under the Accumulative lens. The negotiator’s agency is the rope-drop; the visible price is the psychic exposure that follows. Cost is legible but not viscerally sharp, keeping the score just below 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—aligning heart and action—signals early and tightens once at sunrise when sorrow dissolves. Escalation is textural: density of light, water, compass steadiness reweights the stake. Conflict is internal; no external antagonist or reversible loss beyond regret. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under accumulative lens but keeps pressure shy of 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—spark empathy—signaled early; pressure deepens only once, at mirror, but that moment is observational, not a tightening that narrows live options. Cost is conceptual (own reflection) rather than felt on-page; escalation is lyric accumulation, not causal squeeze. Sufficient for this length, but not the sharper 8.8 band that demands a visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens when spice paste risks turning her bones to bark. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no alternative path is foreclosed on the page, so the cost feels prospective rather than paid, keeping pressure below the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—retrieve lost minutes to pay for unborn sorrow—is signaled early; pressure escalates by image density rather than by antagonist. One meaningful intensification occurs when the saucer crack widens into a vapor staircase, forcing her upward; the cost is conceptual (she must release her grief) but not felt on the body. Agency is present—she unfastens, whispers, climbs, places the droplet—yet the final price is lyric rather than visceral, keeping the score below the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: open the locked dimension without force. Escalation is textural: shimmer density, smile-activated weight loss, seam widening—each beat raising the cost of failure (perpetual drift vs. new genesis). The final grin seizes the decisive leverage; no external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—does captured transformation stay bottled or escape?—is signaled early and tightens when the glass trembles and shatters, narrowing her option to control. Escalation is textural: each new glow layer (jar → sand → sky) raises the stakes for meaning. Cost is present (loss of control, jar, old identity) but feels diffuse because Mara never actively decides to break the vessel; the wind does it for her. Still, the pattern-driven intensification cleanly meets the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“awaken dormant minds without battle”—is signaled early and tightens through each encoded mark; the blackout clock heightens risk of detection. One meaningful deepening: when Kael slots the quill, the cradle’s invisible current rewrites the garrison’s thoughts, foreclosing the option of overt revolt. Cost is conceptual but legible: the fort’s loyalty circuitry is permanently rewired. Agency stays his; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can intentional pattern rewrite an already-seen future?—is signaled in the first 80 words and tightens through the stone sequence. The deepening occurs when the flame follows her math: possibility is literally ignited, foreclosing the fatalism she arrived with. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal; the dust-flame drifts seaward, seeding other bluffs, so her personal loss is implicit (perpetual vigilance). A more tangible price—blood on basalt, vision blackout—would punch escalation into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can intellectual combat turn questions into destinations?—is signaled early and re-asked at the end, giving the duel conceptual stakes beyond victory. Escalation is tonal deepening rather than causal narrowing: each sword-clang adds a paragraph to the “story of reason and rhythm,” reweighting the same stake with poetic density. No visible price (blood, forfeiture) is paid; cost is purely conceptual when the duel becomes a public lecture. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens, but lower band because cost is oblique, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—beauty-from-anarchy via rebuilt shelves—is signaled early and re-asserted nightly; pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversals. One meaningful tightening: coffee-tin seeds → sprouting floor cracks → lantern finale reweights the stake from secret to public sanctuary. Agency is mostly collective and lyrical; no single beat forces a trade-off or loss. Cost is conceptual (perpetual outsider vigilance) rather than viscerally felt on-page, capping escalation below 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rewrite fate via unplanned encore—is signaled early and tightens only once, when compasses dim and darkness becomes the live deadline; cost is conceptual (time serenaded into stopping) rather than forfeiture of an alternative path. Agency is present—he splices, climbs, presses chord—but no beat shows him tempted to abandon the plan, so pressure accumulates without reversal. Under Accumulative lens this suffices; a single meaningful intensification is met when night finally “accepts” the horizon and the clock assents.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory via seed before monsoon—is signaled early and tightens perceptibly: each symbolic translation brightens lanterns, visibly raising odds of success. Agency is internal (symbolic decoding) but forecloses alternative paths—she can’t force sprout, only prepare. Cost is conceptual but legible: luminous doubt that storm may drown shoots. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required. Coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—release island’s regret—declared early, but no external or internal force opposes tutor; pressure flatlines. Mid-text “needle quivered” promises test, yet no trade-off, risk, or irreversible choice follows; escalation plateaus. Agency limited to ritual speech; absence of resistance makes victory foregone. Felt cost is atmospheric (cerulean sky) not personal, so tension stays ambient.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—testing whether microscopic dust can “preprocess reality”—is signaled early and deepens through controlled observation. Pressure escalates texturally: cracks widen, air enters, humidity shifts, transforming ruin into sanctuary. Agency is subtle but present—Mara’s daily notes, placement of vial, alignment with light—all narrow her path from supernovas to garden ghosts. Cost is felt: relinquishing dramatic discovery for patient, invisible influence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming artistic purpose after destruction—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger reveals hidden paths tied to her craft. The meaningful tightening occurs at sunrise: frost melts to expose the groove, forcing commitment to the unknown. Cost is visible (lost workshop, reliance on fragile clues) and alters tactics (using frost patterns as guides). Agency drives escalation—Elya chooses to retrace, interpret, and rebuild—but the danger feels abstract; no real opposition tests her resolve beyond environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into audible music—is signaled early and tightens when Mara activates the device, narrowing her option from passive remembrance to active sonification. The escalation is driven by her agency: opening the case, pressing fork to palm, initiating feedback. Cost is felt in the “heavy tide” of silence and visible in scars smoothed by vibration. The deepening shift occurs when visitors arrive, transforming personal ritual into communal beacon—raising stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing rest for the dead—is signaled early and tightens through Marlow’s escalating commitment: from carrying the lens to occupying “impossibly thin slice of air.” Agency is clear: each placement of a shard narrows his options until only self-dissolution remains. Cost is felt in “weight lift from his shoulders” juxtaposed with vanishing—peace achieved through erasure. Coincidence (the package) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems solely from Marlow’s stubborn persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (feeding the community under sanctions) is signaled early and tightens via the bell-run system, foreclosing reliance on external aid. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she secures the bell, initiates runs, and declares success—each act narrowing options (e.g., anonymity prevents betrayal). Cost is felt: volunteers risk capture, children learn labor, and Mara bears relentless responsibility. Sanctions function as coherent pressure, not coincidence, though border patrols remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing unused love—is signaled early and tightens through Milo’s breath-controlled revelation of the map. Agency is clear: each exhalation alters the image, culminating in the filament that ignites the lattice. Cost is legible—the tear dims, the pilgrimage ends, the lens is relinquished—but remains conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, though the “veil of forgotten promises” resolves too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolving boundaries between memory and moment—is signaled early and deepens when Mara arranges fading photographs to echo dissolution. The meaningful tightening occurs when the child’s breath triggers the garden to bloom a new arch, forcing a reconfiguration of temporal logic. Cost is felt conceptually: the photographs vanish, leaving only scent—a sacrifice of fixed memory for fluid presence. However, escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven agency; Mara observes and whispers gratitude but doesn’t make a high-stakes choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—securing genetic diversity to prevent famine—is signaled early and tightens through the puzzle lock, which demands personal memory over brute force. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her decoding reweights knowledge into access. The cost is conceptual (breaking silence around shared knowledge) and physical (the collapsing carnival), felt in the final rumble and fallen wall. While pressure is coherent, the absence of a tangible antagonist or complicating reversal slightly softens the conflict’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of broken trust—is signaled early and deepens via the forge’s consumption of voids. Pressure escalates texturally: from single hue-tones to a “full chord” of amber and teal, with cost felt in Mara’s burdened hands. Agency lies in attention and ritual (placing coral, returning nightly), which qualifies as endurance under Accumulative lens. However, no live option is foreclosed; the “tightening” is tonal, not tactical, slightly limiting cost visibility despite lyrical potency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—accessing and reinterpreting “illuminated moments”—is signaled early and deepens when Lira shifts from collector to guardian. Escalation occurs via floral codes and moonbeam projections, but agency is passive: solutions arrive via gifts (rose, lilies) rather than earned struggle. Cost is conceptual (a change in purpose) but not felt physically or socially; no option is foreclosed, weakening pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s realization that safety demands patience, not control. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons speed for slow cooling, a choice that narrows her tactics and aligns with her glassblowing ethos. Cost is conceptual (surrendering command logic) and felt (the weight of planetary thaw), though not viscerally dramatized as loss. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with the ice’s “soft percussion” and panel flicker escalating ambient tension without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from self-betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when the shell demands confession as price. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, steps on the lever, and accepts the breath-gift. The cost (exposing her hidden terror) is felt in her “trembling certainty” and the vial’s demand. Yet the mechanism’s collapse threat feels abstract; stakes remain psychological rather than viscerally immediate, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—drawing a map of endless night—is signaled early and deepens when the oracle realizes the void “refuses containment,” forcing him to seal the map in his breath rather than preserve it physically. This renunciation constitutes Earned Stasis: he forecloses possession of the map to honor the night’s nature, with visible cost (the map dissolves at dawn). Escalation occurs via protagonist agency—he chooses to retell silence despite knowing the futility—and the storm’s intensification serves as pressure, not resolution. Coincidence never solves; the single star’s timing heightens tension but doesn’t alter outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—tracing the origin of thought—is signaled early and deepens through the violin interaction. Agency is clear: the robot initiates alignment, projects memory, and interprets resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when it chooses to amalgamate echo with code, narrowing its purpose from waste management to consciousness synthesis. Cost is felt in the irreversible melting of the violin, though no tangible loss (e.g., system degradation) raises the price higher.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the town through honest transparency—is signaled early via the composer’s forgotten case and deepens when Mara uses the lens to amplify “trembling honesty of the walls.” Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: deciphering doodles, projecting confessions, redefining the ledger as a promise. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: honesty replaces accusation, thawing mistrust without confrontation. The mayor’s ticket offers continuity, not resolution, preserving tension. Minor deduction: the “single microphone” as sentinel feels slightly convenient, though thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and deepens through the polishing ritual, which narrows his focus to mending deception via labor. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each polished marble yields a new path, escalating toward the oak. Cost is legible (“truths can fracture under too much sun”) and crystallizes in the Earned Stasis of mutual recognition. But the “measurable luck” device complicates without raising tangible stakes—it’s atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s calibration of the lever. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she projects the holographic lattice, pulls the lever, and interprets the results. Cost is felt in the crew’s collective awe and the birds’ changed behavior, though no personal sacrifice is shown. Under an Accumulative lens, this single tightening suffices, but a sharper trade-off (e.g., risking station stability) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s code to release a silenced aria—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the code lies in silences, not notes. This insight narrows her options to one resonant chord, raising conceptual stakes. Agency is clear: her sustained note triggers the water’s response and the ghost’s release. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from searching to witnessing—a quiet relinquishment of mystery for communion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—measuring the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through Mirela’s active interventions: smudging ink, adjusting the barometer, occupying margins. Each act narrows options (e.g., fever’s end closes delirium’s escape) and deepens knowledge (humidity gradient reveals lie’s mass). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in auroral sorrow’s transformation and the stone’s paradoxical heaviness/lightness. Coincidence never resolves—truth emerges only through tactile, calibrated effort.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—measuring the swallowed truth’s weight—is signaled early and tightens when Mara aligns radio static with the wheel’s oscillation. His agency drives the deepening, culminating in renunciation with felt cost. Yet escalation leans heavily on exposition (“he realized the wheel was engineered…”), not on-stage discovery. The ghost shift’s pressure remains ambient, not coercive, softening the tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to regenerative silence—is signaled early and deepens through the keeper’s burrowing, which narrows options (fissure tightens, walls breathe). Agency is present: he chooses to descend, enter the refuge, and write. Cost is conceptual (centuries’ weight erased) and atmospheric (“crumbling peace… fragile as glass”), though not visceral or irreversible. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory saturation and spatial compression, not tactical trade-offs, slightly limiting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—linking wonder to everyday rhythm—is signaled early and deepens texturally, not causally. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than consequential; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The eclipse complicates nothing; it merely frames. Liora’s agency is expressive, not decisive—she plays, others respond, but no trade-off or risk alters tactics. Cost is conceptual (“attentive hearts”) but lacks on-page embodiment or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost cosmic alignment—is signaled early and deepens when diaries reveal humming as axis echo. The historian’s agency drives escalation: his choice to descend the stairwell narrows options (abandoning surface safety) and raises cost (confronting irreversible knowledge). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pattern recognition earns the breakthrough. However, the “price” remains abstract—no tangible forfeiture beyond expended effort—slightly muting the cost’s visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—encoding human truth beyond mortality—is signaled early and deepens when the writer realizes cookies can carry microdots. Pressure escalates via the clandestine network’s “last orders,” tightening his window for action. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the method arrives via specs, not invention; the visitor’s epiphany is passive. Cost is implied (lives traded for hope) but not dramatized as a sacrifice the writer makes or witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing possession by stabilizing the anchor through indigo revelation—is signaled early and tightens as “the clock of possession ticks.” The priest’s agency drives escalation: each rhetorical phrase, looped chord, and droplet of color narrows options until the final spear-like plunge. Cost is conceptual (risk of soul consumption) and societal (city’s shackled assumptions), though the personal price remains abstract. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of resonance into rupture satisfies the single meaningful intensification required.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating unheard symphonies into audible form—is signaled early and deepens when Lian risks exhaustion to sketch on frost. Agency drives escalation: her choice to “Conduct” fractures the horizon, transforming passive longing into active creation. Cost is unmistakable: the “upended hush” shifts from void to orchestra, implying irreversible commitment to vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory density rather than causal turns, satisfying the single-meaningful-deepening standard.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—conquering the inner labyrinth—is signaled early and tightens through the procedural algorithm, which narrows options by demanding alignment with “darkening brightness.” The cost is conceptual: accepting fractured selves means surrendering unity, paid when the tablet dissolves and he becomes “periodically eternal.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing paths), though the pressure remains abstract rather than visceral, limiting felt immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and escalates through Marin’s confrontation with reversed then forward songs, narrowing options from passive reception to active rewinding. Agency is clear: she chooses to force songs forward, pressing against the filament of hush. Cost is felt as eroded apathy and revived heartbeat, though not deeply material. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density builds until the forward burst reweights silence into feeling. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure arises from Marin’s choices within the cavern’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering truth past quarantine—is signaled early and tightens when the pigeon tube appears, foreclosing ordinary routes. Elara’s lateral method constitutes agency under Accumulative pressure; the cost is solitude with purpose. Coincidence (being followed) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she acts alone. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from observation to clandestine delivery crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered tears—is signaled early and deepens when the vapor reveals collective historical grief, expanding Arlen’s personal loss into universal mourning. His agency drives escalation: uncorking the vial is a deliberate act that forecloses ignorance. Cost is felt (tears, throat tightening) and conceptual (accepting grief as perpetual labor). Though pressure intensifies beautifully, the “traveling merchant” backstory slightly dilutes immediacy; the tightening could feel more causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through impossible choices that narrow options: fireflies vs. lantern, rope vs. ether. Each fork reweights stakes via protagonist agency (e.g., choosing tethering over release), with cost felt in lost echoes and sealed memories. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: density increases as mineral layers reveal “centuries when time itself had been woven into rope,” culminating in a final trade-off that crystallizes his stance. Coincidence never resolves; energy beings merely catalyze, never dictate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unbinding silence through music—is signaled early and deepens via the violinist’s performance, which transforms the chronic hush into a “gentle hum.” Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her bowing initiates the bowl’s vibration, vine movement, and communal shift. Cost is conceptual (the burden of unfinished stories) and felt (the weight of ancestral memory), though not viscerally dramatized as physical or social loss. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the absence of a foreclosed option slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming raw sentiment into vendible half-truths—is signaled early and deepens as static “maps sorrow, joy, longing.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara subsumes ambient sentiment into the petal, foreclosing authentic emotional processing in favor of commodified empathy. Cost is visible: she wears “affectionate detachment like a comfortable cloak,” implying habitual sacrifice. Though escalation is textural rather than causal, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens and culminates in a stance crystallization: she will keep harvesting.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—returning unseen stories to visibility—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s ledger and the full-moon reading. However, escalation relies on coincidence (misdelivered envelope) rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the lighthouse keeper’s shared grief resolves tension without meaningful cost. The tightening (from private act to public ceremony) lacks a foreclosed alternative or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forging kinship in a place of loss—is signaled early and deepens through the shared search for the glyph. The meaningful tightening occurs at the pillar: the glyph is visible only as a halo around the bark, demanding collective perception over individual discovery. Arlen’s agency drives escalation—she invites, leads, promises, and vows—and the cost is felt in the “fragile, beautiful duty” that never fades. Though stakes remain abstract, they’re viscerally rendered through light, touch, and woven reeds, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where echoes are born—is signaled early and deepens into becoming the echo herself. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification (chime, violet glow, luminous ribbon) and culminates in a trade-off: Mira must release the pendant to restore time’s flow. Agency is maintained throughout—she draws, whispers, steps, presses, releases. Cost is felt: she forfeits the talisman, yet gains integration into the city’s song. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her actions under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering grief’s hidden equation—is signaled early and deepens when the stone’s cracks “sing” sorrow that resonates with roots, raising emotional stakes. The conjurer’s agency drives escalation: his placement of glass eyes triggers the stone’s response, and his interpretation of the numeric pattern transforms understanding. Cost is felt conceptually: he relinquishes the need for resolution, embracing loss as generative. However, pressure remains abstract; no tangible consequence (e.g., physical toll, irreversible choice) tightens options beyond intellectual insight.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rendering lost stories visible—is signaled early and tightens when the reel completes the circuit, forcing Maren to choose between remaining hidden or becoming a conduit. The cost is legible: she surrenders invisibility, exposing herself to the city’s grief. Agency is clear—she *chooses* to cache, to follow resonance, to step forward—but the escalation leans more on atmospheric accumulation than a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether forced change or patient surrender—is signaled early and deepens when Marlowe chooses non-intervention. The tightening occurs at the copper wire placement: a subtle act that paradoxically releases control, narrowing his options to observation alone. Cost is felt conceptually (his ego) and viscerally (the waiting, the risk of failure). Though escalation is gentle, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens, with storm season acting as a live temporal pressure that rhythms the narrative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into restorative meaning—is signaled early and tightens when Mara must surrender her paintings. The exchange forces a tangible trade-off: personal legacy for communal hope. Pressure escalates organically through the rain trail’s pull and the brooch’s whisper, culminating in a choice that narrows her path (no more canvases). Cost is felt in the “haggard awe” and the implied loss of her only solace, yet the island’s tremor validates her sacrifice. Agency remains hers throughout; luck complicates (the rain trail appears) but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure never tightens into tangible risk. The “steadily unpredictable change” is declared, not dramatized; no choice forecloses a path or extracts visible cost. The pilgrim’s arrival raises anticipation but introduces no obstacle—his prayer is granted effortlessly. Escalation is textural (song crescendo, shadows brighten) not causal; coincidence (his timely arrival) complicates nothing and resolves everything, violating Situational/Accumulative guardrails that demand coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist shifts from collector to catalyst, enabling communal storytelling. The meaningful deepening occurs at sunrise: his trill invites others to contribute, foreclosing solitary curation. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of control, though it’s conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is driven by his agency under an Accumulative lens, but the “distant shout” slightly dilutes closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when the phantom punch unlocks the staircase, narrowing options to irreversible descent. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the punch, triggering the sizzle and click. Cost is felt as lifelong duty (“promising to return each hour…”), though the absence of tangible loss (time, tool, relationship) slightly limits pressure depth for elite-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sculpting mental space for entangled memories—is signaled early and deepens as the tile’s shifting numbers demand transcription under whale-song pressure. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Lira’s disciplined note-taking evolves into active co-creation with the sea. Cost is legible in her softened eyes and rare peace—skepticism surrendered for shared resonance—but the pressure remains internalized, limiting externalized consequence expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—confronting finality—is signaled early and deepens when the amulet reveals itself as a key. The immortal’s agency drives escalation: he chooses silence to preserve the lattice, then presses the fragment to seek signs. Cost is legible in his relinquished emptiness. However, the spatial mutiny resolves too smoothly; the “lattice” threat lacks tangible consequence beyond aesthetic disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (asylum as proof of moral calculus) is signaled early and deepens when grief becomes the medium for ink’s alchemy. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara chooses active waiting over haste, letting sorrow “settle into dense fog”—a protagonist-driven escalation that narrows options (only this ritual works). Cost is legible: her father’s legacy of deception is risked on parchment, and bureaucratic rigidity dissolves only after emotional labor. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—collecting temporal textures through invented histories—is signaled early and deepens through the act of writing. Pressure accumulates via sensory density and the weight of silence, but there’s no narrowing of options or tangible trade-off; the stationer never faces a choice that costs him something concrete. The escalation is atmospheric rather than consequential, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits felt agency. Still, the thematic pressure tightens credibly toward the CR at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and deepens when the label reveals timestamped numbers matching overheard fragments. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they choose to follow the glow, interpret the numbers, and stand before the murals. Cost is felt (“cold filament,” “void in official records”) and culminates in Charged Poise: keeper role accepted with irreversible identity trade-off. Coincidence (tide surge) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the label’s function is earned through prior layering.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle of why myths endure—is signaled early and deepens through Selene’s interaction with the cello and ledger. The meaningful tightening occurs when the ephemeral compass spins wildly, forcing her to reinterpret the quest not as solution-seeking but as stewardship of wonder. Agency is maintained: her act of retelling weaves into the hum, catalyzing revelation. Cost is conceptual (abandoning fixed answers) and faintly emotional (melancholy of dissolution), though not viscerally dramatized. Coincidence is avoided; all escalation stems from her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal autonomy against privatization—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s reorganization campaign. The meaningful deepening occurs when graffiti shifts from hidden code to public phoenix, crystallizing collective agency. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each spray-painted symbol alters spatial dynamics and investor perception. Cost is felt in the “tireless work” and “fragile harmony,” though a more concrete personal sacrifice (e.g., severing a relationship, losing a stall) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—archiving the last grain before colonial erasure—is signaled early and tightens as sunlight advances. The inspector’s agency drives escalation: he engineers a timed reaction to outlast fleeting light, foreclosing improvisation. Cost is felt in his grief and the irreversible loss of unrecorded midnights. Coincidence (wind stirring dust) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on his prepared method.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—precision in repair to enable autonomous navigation—is signaled early and tightens when Mara detects the wing’s lag under stress. Agency is clear: she chooses water-refraction over visual inspection, applies the polymer strip, and records data. The escalation is subtle but sufficient under an Accumulative lens: ambient clamor rises, anchor lifts, ship departs—all external rhythms that heighten the quiet intensity of her focus. Cost is conceptual: her labor remains invisible to cheering workers, yet she endures with assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping the river’s hidden origin—is signaled early and deepens when the phrasebook reveals “Kaltwasser,” narrowing options to immediate action. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mara chooses to transmit, aligns the antenna, and presses the phrasebook to the glass. The cost is felt in the “quiet dread” and tolling bell, heralding irreversible change. Coincidence (falcon’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s decisions drive the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—is signaled early and deepens as imagined footsteps become real, tightening the link between rhythm and reconstruction. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: his tuning guides invisible hands, then welcomes actual workers, merging vision with collective action. Cost is conceptual but felt: the tuner’s solitude is the price of revival. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though physical or emotional toll on him would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—securing the vial before oxygen runs out—tightens meaningfully when Mara chooses to silence the distress signal, foreclosing rescue. Pressure escalates via battery countdown and physical immersion, culminating in a trade-off between survival and legacy. Cost is felt in the beacon’s fade, though the temple’s “price” remains abstract rather than concretely tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming false warnings into truthful guidance—is signaled early and deepens through the lattice’s activation. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally; the fog and pulsing lattice prompt action, but no real opposition or narrowing of options occurs. The boy faces no meaningful risk or loss; the “bodies” emerge passively. Escalation relies on atmosphere, not agency, limiting cost legibility despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—repaying a transgenerational debt—is signaled early and deepens through each cameo visit, culminating in the fatal act of transforming love into venomous fertilizer. Pressure escalates via the bead’s increasing glow and the soil’s responsive swelling, driven entirely by the protagonist’s agency. The cost is unmistakable: her dissolution. One tightening suffices at this length, and it’s executed with resonant clarity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming ruin into reverence—is signaled early and deepens through the weaver’s defiance of “broken precedents.” Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: each stitched filament adds luminosity, culminating in the guildmasters’ humility. Yet escalation lacks agency-driven turning points; the “overlapping sleepwalking paths” produce change effortlessly, with no tactical adaptation or credible loss. Cost is conceptual (empty tide pools, silence) but not viscerally paid—no stamina, tool, or social credit is forfeited, weakening the stakes’ urgency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost faith—is signaled early and deepens through tactile engagement with relics. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara places the sundial base, triggering root movement and bone-rattling cadence, which narrows her path to completion. Cost is conceptual (time, solitude, emotional labor) but not viscerally felt; no tool is lost, no injury sustained. Agency is consistent, though pressure remains internalized rather than externally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving surface mail as conduit for marginal thoughts—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s ritual, which tightens from personal practice to cosmic transmission. The meaningful intensification occurs when the chalk code reveals a hidden address, raising stakes from local gesture to interdimensional dispatch. Agency is clear: Mara chooses to embed her pseudonym, accepting the cost of dissolving fixed identity. However, external pressure is minimal (no antagonist or obstacle), relying on internal drive; under Accumulative lens, this suffices, but the absence of tangible resistance slightly limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing the coup before it strikes—is signaled early and tightens through the embroiderer’s deepening synchronization with the flame, which narrows her focus to actionable truths. Agency is expressed through attention and interpretation, not physical confrontation, and the cost is felt in the ember’s exhaustion and the risk of courier interception. Escalation is driven by her choices (e.g., aligning thread with timeline), though the conspirators’ moves arrive via mystical revelation rather than causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—releasing unsent apologies—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the glass pane scatters the words, forcing adaptation (letters now carried by spirits into soil). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to evoke voices twice, deepening stakes each time. Cost is visible—the grief evaporates only after vocalization—but the “breeze knocking glass aside” edges toward coincidence, slightly undercutting full ownership of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming testimony into healing—is signaled early and deepens through the coral metaphor, but escalation hinges on magical realism (notes glowing, coral absorbing words) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The anesthetic acts as a coincidental trigger, not a choice, weakening agency. Cost is present (the translator’s sorrowful-sweet ache) but remains emotional rather than tangible; no path is foreclosed, only sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering and sharing lost joy—is signaled early and deepens through the mural’s expansion, culminating in shared laughter as “reclaimed wonder.” Pressure accumulates texturally: each brushstroke intensifies communal response, and the knowledge network’s pulse underscores collective stakes. Yet agency remains largely unilateral; the artist acts, the world reacts. No meaningful trade-off or foreclosed path emerges—joy arrives without sacrifice, diluting the felt cost required for higher escalation under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through escalating sensory revelations. Each echo tightens Lena’s options: she cannot unsee the flickering past restorations or unhear the garden’s question. Agency is clear in her brush taps that “bewitch the reflected sound,” transforming passive listening into co-creation. Cost is felt in the dissolution of known murals, though the price remains largely conceptual rather than material or relational.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defending unpayable freedom of thought—is signaled early and deepens through Lysander’s tactical use of gardens as message fields. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he scatters the seed, whispers verses, and welcomes chaos. Cost is felt in the silent insects, Mirabel’s risked reputation, and the implied vulnerability of exposure. However, the “tax collector of thoughts” remains abstract; tighter linkage between bureaucratic threat and on-page pressure would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into healing beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the postcard arrives, narrowing options: he must now act on cosmic hope, not just observe sorrow. The meaningful tightening occurs when he begins ensconcing thoughts in the shell, trading passive witnessing for active creation, with the cost of enduring centuries more of solitude. Though coincidence introduces the postcard, it complicates rather than resolves; agency lies in his response. However, escalation leans heavily on accumulation over causal pressure, slightly limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct feelings—is signaled early and deepens when the traveler arrives, transforming private ritual into shared legacy. The meaningful tightening occurs when the caretaker offers the orchid, shifting from solitary endurance to transmission, with the cost being renewed sorrow (“foxglove regret return[s]”). Escalation is driven by her systematic actions, not coincidence, though the traveler’s arrival leans slightly deus ex machina. Still, the cost—cyclical grief—is felt and integrated into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust via transcription—is signaled early and deepens as glyphs demand reciprocal promises. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each glyph requires a personal vow (sunrise, rain), narrowing her emotional margin. Cost is felt conceptually (centuries of silence as broken pact) but lacks visceral forfeiture—no tool breaks, time isn’t lost, stamina wanes. The “paths diverge” clock tightens tactics sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing preservation vs. progress—is signaled early and deepens when the chain’s “encrypted compassion” becomes operational, transforming abstract values into a working mechanism. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her analysis of adhesive residue leads directly to the valve’s calibration, narrowing options from debate to embodied synthesis. Cost is felt in the elder’s trembling doubts and the city’s shift from “conquest” to “conversation.” However, the opposition remains off-stage until the end, slightly softening the pressure’s immediacy during the central act.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving echoes of lost songs—is signaled early and deepens as Lila shifts from solitary mapping to trusting pigeons as messengers. The meaningful tightening occurs when she attaches meteorite slivers to birds, risking loss of the celestial fragment to enable communal resonance. Cost is legible: the “inevitable wilt of memory” persists even as hope spreads, and trust requires surrendering control. Escalation is driven by Lila’s agency, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens through tactile exploration. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: pressing palm to copper, analyzing grain, stepping on hidden seams. Cost is conceptual (carrying talismans against the unknown) and felt (shedding “weight of loss”), though not visceral. The tightening—moving from passive listening to active map-reading—narrows options toward a single path, satisfying lens coherence under Accumulative/Textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and deepens through sensory communion, but pressure remains diffuse and untested. Aria faces no resistance, failure, or meaningful obstacle; the spirits comply, the instruments work perfectly, and time (until sunrise) imposes mood rather than tactical urgency. The tightening is textural, not consequential—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices for resonance but not for high-band escalation with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering vanished paths before memory fades—is signaled early and tightens via each seed’s hue narrowing options (teal → bridge direction; violet → caravan scene). Agency is clear: Maren chooses which seeds to press, where to step, when to place the final seed. Cost is felt in the fragility of recovered images (“faded as quickly as it formed”) and the ever-present threat of thinning tides. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of hues builds until the fissure stitches shut. Coincidence (bird’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is Maren’s.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—ordering randomness to reveal harmony—is signaled early and deepens through the ink-drop’s formation of an X, which triggers the violin improvisation. Agency is clear: the performer interprets signs and acts, though escalation leans atmospheric over causal pressure. Cost is conceptual (ephemeral art washed away) but legible in the final image. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the tide’s return is natural, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—inscribing an eternal celestial verse—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes binding the speck requires “fledging her own limits.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she slips through “gaps between the tide’s rhythm and the garden’s sighs,” narrowing her method to precise observation. Cost is felt: years of elective exile, solitude as prerequisite. Agency drives escalation—her movements summon the tide, her breath initiates the inscription—and the final act crystallizes her stance: exile was pilgrimage. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—illuminating value in the mundane—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure; it deepens texturally rather than escalating causally. The “tightening” is the stone’s rings forming a spiral echoing a ship’s wheel, which reweights meaning but doesn’t narrow Mira’s options or force a trade-off. Cost is implied (“deeds forgotten and newly appreciated”) but not felt as loss, omission, or sacrifice. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the absence of any on-page friction between want and obstacle limits stakes to contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into a universal language—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s ritual with the box. The meaningful tightening occurs at the altar: she chooses not to keep the box’s power but to carry it to the village, foreclosing private atonement for public offering. Cost is felt in the “gentle yet heavy” weight and “fire-scarred skin.” Agency is present (she walks, sets, lifts, opens), though escalation leans textual rather than causal; the celestial “slow dance” complicates but doesn’t drive pressure. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift toward communal reception earns the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing communal faith through measurable hope—is signaled early and deepens when parallel timelines reveal equation-dependent altitudes. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Arin designs trials, interprets results, and proposes the festival. Cost is conceptual (the council’s unsettled tradition) and social (daring to encode belief in public art), legible when villagers decorate shorelines with luminous equations. However, the “tightening” lacks visceral trade-offs—no resource loss, time pressure, or personal sacrifice sharpens the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the walls’ dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes the burden must be shared. The meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the negative to the stone and hears the hum, shifting from solitary archivist to communal witness. Cost is felt (“warm ash against her spine”) and escalates through seasonal changes in the walls’ dreams. Agency is present, though escalation leans more on revelation than active conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and deepens as coded lullabies activate the terrace. Pressure escalates texturally: silence thickens, children’s voices rise, mirrors flicker. The tightening occurs when the bell’s imminent toll creates urgency, forcing completion before interruption. Yet agency is diffuse; the painter’s success feels preordained by the world’s receptivity rather than hard-won through constrained choice or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redemption through shared vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens when Lira writes on a blank page, making ideals tangible. The tightening occurs when the first chieftain steps forward, narrowing options from potential refusal to collective surrender. Cost is unmistakable: “quiet ache that steadied her resolve,” swords laid down as symbols. Agency drives escalation—Lira’s writing, speaking, lifting the clipboard—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving an extinct bird’s echo amid self-made scarcity—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s tactical use of environmental acoustics. Escalation is driven by his agency: reading the crack-map, timing the release, unsealing the case. The meaningful tightening occurs at the climax: the egg must shatter in perfect synchronicity with the thunder’s hush, narrowing options to a single fragile moment. Cost is felt conceptually (his cruelty masked as charity) though not viscerally dramatized in physical or social loss.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—defying the lullaby of conformity through resonance—is signaled early and escalates via the courtesan’s active untangling of threads, each releasing echoes that build pressure. The tightening occurs when she realizes the harvest is a symphony, not a weapon, shifting tactics from extraction to performance. Cost is conceptual (the end of collective silence) but lacks a tangible, personal forfeiture; the stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally embodied in loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling as reversal of exploitative myth—is signaled early and deepens when Selene reinterprets puppet strings as lifelines, not controls. This conceptual tightening forecloses her prior method (directed moralizing) with visible cost: she must surrender narrative certainty. Agency is clear in her choice to let the fire die, embracing ambiguity. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory and symbolic density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring forgotten histories—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s construction of temporary signals, culminating in a resonant trade-off: permanence is rejected in favor of ephemerality that ripples forward. The escalation occurs via cadence shift and density increase: the monarchs’ passage tightens the window, the moth wing becomes a hymn, and the structures glow in sync with wingbeats. While pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, the lack of opposition means the cost remains conceptual (no lost opportunity, tool, or relationship)—felt but not dramatized through consequence. Still, the final renunciation of stone monuments for glowing threads reweights the stake with undeniable thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes this act thaws “the deepest cold within any heart.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she reconfigures the rope, risking disruption of sacred memory for renewal. Cost is felt: eternal solstice returns, vigilance against silence. Agency is clear—Mara’s hands drive every turn—but the escalation leans more on textural accumulation than narrowing options, slightly limiting pressure under a strict causal reading.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes walkers carry past stories and future promises, making them worthy. Pressure escalates via the approaching storm, which tightens the window for action and culminates in the vortex ascent. The meaningful deepening occurs when she perceives the moment as a nexus of radiating decisions—a shift in knowledge that reweights the entire premise. Cost is felt in her soaked feet and the irreversible rewriting of the directive; agency is clear in her incantation and placement of the seal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant to answer silent prayers—is signaled early and deepens through Nabu’s schematic labor. Escalation occurs via alignment with planets and moon, narrowing his window to “between regimes.” Yet the tightening lacks tangible consequence: no failed attempt, resource depletion, or rival pressure raises cost. The “empirically ironic” tension (grain rations vs. cosmic fate) is thematic but not dramatized as a live trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment through nonviolent means—is signaled early and tightens during the monks’ circle, where success hinges on the fragile reality-shift window. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she places the box, whispers guidance, and later redeploys it for the wanderer. Cost is felt conceptually (the burden of carrying peace into a broken world) but not viscerally; no tool is lost, no time forfeited, no social credit spent. The stakes deepen thematically but lack material trade-offs that would elevate pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the dream through boundary-erasure—is signaled early and deepens via synchronized breathing, which narrows tactics to attunement over force. Pressure escalates texturally: fog resists, then collaborates; the dream coils only after breath syncs with its pulse. Cost is felt in Arlen’s anchoring—his rootedness implies sacrifice of mobility for guardianship. Coincidence never resolves; agency lies in rhythmic endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing fractured legacy through quartz and kinship—is signaled early and deepens when the ribbon snags, personalizing the abstract breach. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to apply grandmother’s method, aligning quartz with orchard pulse. The cost (guild severance, emotional vulnerability) is present but lightly borne; the tightening occurs via the ribbon incident, which forces immediate care and sparks the repair idea. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—persistence does.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge of nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the bathroom becomes the only locus of clarity, narrowing options. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each inquiry reshapes the orchard’s response, culminating in the cameo press that floods his mind. Cost is unmistakable: surrender of linear self-narrative, felt as “brightened disquiet.” Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the stake without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing unlearned lessons—is signaled early and deepens through Selene’s method: each gap discovered tightens her path toward the vault. Agency is clear; she renegotiates the lock not by force but by linguistic precision, paying the cost of surrendering the diary’s missing page. The escalation is textural (accumulating voids, chords, ivy) yet coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each beat narrowing options until the portal demands another leap. Coincidence (time traveler’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost names—is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested through concrete loss or trade-off. Escalation occurs texturally (more mirrors, thicker fog, ink river) rather than through protagonist-driven pressure that narrows options. The “recapture” action lacks opposition; success arrives via mystical mechanics (swatch card in slot) rather than earned sacrifice. Cost is implied (“weight of unkindled solace”) but not dramatized as a visible price altering tactics—luck resolves what effort could not.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity via the paradoxical door—is signaled early and deepens as Mara must reweave the rope using the seal. The escalation is driven by her agency: descending, unlocking, reconfiguring. The cost is legible—the clock stops, time halts—but it remains conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting the felt price. Still, the narrowing of options (only one method, one moment) creates coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding “the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and deepens through the energy beings’ disruptive presence. Escalation occurs via sensory intensification (auroras shaking calm, violent reverberations), not external threat. The mapkeeper’s agency drives resolution: his method (tracing ice) leads directly to the stone. Cost is subtle but present—the perpetual duty implied in “ever ready to conjure another bloom of hush”—though not viscerally dramatized as loss.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving meaning in randomness—is signaled early and tightens when the caravan arrives, transforming personal vigil into collective mission. The custodian’s agency drives escalation: aligning prism, tracking stars, welcoming strangers. Cost is legible—the solitary life foreclosed for shared burden—but the shard’s success borders on convenient resonance. Still, the deepening (network of towers) emerges from prior logic, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from collective memory—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s ritual. Agency is expressed via attention and interpretation, culminating in the decision to engrave new insight, which forecloses passive reception for active transmission. Cost is conceptual (bearing centuries of memory) but legible in the “weight” pressing on his thoughts and the trembling quill. Escalation is driven by environmental changes (fog thickening, lanterns flickering), though protagonist-initiated pressure could be sharper to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming despair into hope through fireworks—is signaled early and deepens via the designer’s defiance. Escalation occurs through his agency: chanting stirs air, sparks land on unseen tiles, and the burst completes the mosaic. Cost is conceptual (endless wandering, laborious stitching) but not visceral; the “gravity of hopelessness” dissipates without material trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through sensory and textual density rather than narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—foreseeing the outcome of a fragile truce—is signaled early and deepens through the chronicler’s attunement to “transition periods.” Pressure escalates via accumulating clues (owl call, breeze, eye flicker), narrowing from cosmic observation to human nuance. The cost is conceptual: her role demands passive witnessing, not influence, which forecloses intervention—a quiet sacrifice. While escalation is driven by perception rather than action, it aligns with the Accumulative lens and culminates in a decisive shift of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting pure flavors of silence—is signaled early and tightened by the rule of “limiting exposure.” The inversion hour creates a live clock that forces precision; failure would tangle filaments. Agency is clear: Lio chooses which silence to harvest and adheres to the method. Cost is subtle but legible—the filaments dissolve, leaving only scent—but the emotional payoff (dissolving fear) slightly softens the price, preventing full 9+ escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s active monitoring and whispering. Pressure escalates texturally: creaks demand counter-tones, the storm glass swirls, then bursts, each intensifying the need for calibrated silence. The tightening occurs when the vial pulses amber, then silver—forcing Lira to release its contents, a renunciation with felt cost (the tool is spent). Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered and never abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—claiming the throne before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking clock, but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than consequential. Mina faces no real obstacle, sacrifice, or irreversible loss; the ruby flake pulses helpfully, murals shiver obligingly, and the stairway appears without resistance. While the sunrise deadline adds urgency, it never forces a costly choice or alters tactics, weakening the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness to breathe—is signaled immediately and deepens through one meaningful intensification: the keeper’s deliberate bridge-burning, which forecloses retreat and raises the cost of failure. Pressure coheres accumulatively; each tap on the threshold narrows his options until the final step through the veil. The cost is legible: he leaves his only tool (the ring) behind, sealing his path. Though stakes remain internal, they feel viscerally urgent due to embodied language (“suffocating shadows,” “aching steps”).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating pressure into diamonds without being consumed—is signaled early and deepens when glitchy texts demand volunteering the bolt. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to trust the quantum promise despite pyramid-scheme scars forecloses the path of cynical withdrawal, with cost legible in the diamonds’ conditional endurance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: each textual glitch, fungal pulse, and Lira’s smile intensifies the thematic weight of “volunteering.” Coincidence (parallel-dimension texts) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the act remains the protagonist’s renunciation of past victimhood.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when the gramophone reveals the cipher. Pressure escalates via sensory attunement, not external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when Lian must interpret rhythm over words, narrowing options to intuitive listening. Cost is conceptual: the dynasty’s legacy shifts from heroic collapse to self-inflicted ignorance. While stakes remain internal, the moral weight of inherited complicity charges the final act without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early and deepens as the knight moves from observer to co-creator. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → hum → phantom chorus → script fire. The decisive tightening occurs when he unsnaps the theater’s heart, foreclosing solitude with visible cost (armor melting). Under Accumulative lens, this cadence shift reweights stakes without causal reversal, satisfying escalation with protagonist-driven agency and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—making forgotten kindnesses visible—is signaled early and deepens through Amelia’s methodical engagement with dust and light. The meaningful tightening occurs when she presents her findings, risking dismissal for poetic interpretation in a bureaucratic space. Yet the supervisor’s instant buy-in deflates tension; the cost of advocacy (rejection, ridicule) is evaded, reducing escalation to a single, frictionless turn. Still, the emotional price of sustained hope in oblivion remains palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—broadcasting coded freedom to revise history—is signaled early and tightens when the transmitter sparks to life, narrowing options to a single act of defiance. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she reads puddles, inserts the key, speaks the code. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the regime must now confront ghosts it ignored. However, no tangible personal loss (time, safety, tool) alters her tactics mid-beat, slightly muting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing a firestorm by dissolving a coded prophecy—is signaled early and tightens through the saxophonist’s whisper, which actively unspools syllables into mist. Agency is clear: his breath, not fate, erases the code. Cost is conceptual (eternal readiness, unspoken promises) and felt in the “weight” he carries, though not viscerally dramatized. Escalation occurs via cadence shift—from emergence to dissolution—with one meaningful deepening: the realization that silence, not song, saves the world.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the forest’s message—is clear from the outset and tightens through each leaf’s revelation. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual: prodding, arranging, building. The discovery of the spring deepens stakes by confirming the speck’s power, and filling the vial amplifies future readings, showing tactical evolution. Cost is felt in Lira’s permanent transformation, though the lack of tangible sacrifice (time, tool loss, physical toll) slightly softens pressure. Still, the escalation is coherent under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling broken time with living uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle quivers, forcing Mara to choose between skepticism and trust. The deepening occurs at the brazier: placing the rose on coals is a high-stakes improvisation that risks destroying the relic but reveals truth. Cost is felt: she forfeits the admiral’s artifact as mere navigation tool, accepting its transformation into metaphor. Coincidence complicates (leaf swirl, courier’s arrival) but resolution stems from her agency—kneeling, whispering, stepping through water.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the coin to understand the weight of names—is signaled early and tightens when the crack widens upon naming, forcing her to commit fully to kintsugi intentions. Agency is clear: her whispered syllable directly causes the fissure to accept gold. Cost is felt (“luminous regret,” vanished search party) and reweights the final moment. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase—the molten gold’s advance parallels her self-knowledge—culminating in a decisive deepening that narrows her worldview to one of deliberate limits.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming sorrowful echoes into hope—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s deepening engagement. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to follow discord, press the tooth to stone, then offer laughter. The cost is felt—a luminous ache that softens but endures—and reconfigures her role permanently. Coincidence never resolves; even the harp’s presence is framed as a known conduit, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering mercy’s formula—is signaled early and deepens via the ultraviolet penance’s escalating cost. Each revelation demands physical pain, narrowing Lira’s options to endurance or retreat; she chooses the former. The tightening is meaningful: trauma becomes method, then scalpel, then ritual. Cost is legible in seared skin and tremors, though the absence of external opposition limits pressure variety.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unfastening the lighthouse’s sealed memory—is signaled early and tightens when intuition anchors must be located among paintings. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: tracing wing curves to flame angles aligns with the fragment’s glow, causing the chain to unfasten. Cost is felt in the irreversible dissolution of the heirloom and the burden of eternal witnessing. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight does, consistent with an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and deepens via dust analysis, phantom tugs, and calliope echoes. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she climbs, pries, retrieves, records. Cost is felt in the lingering burden-turned-purpose and the ghosts’ gratitude as emotional weight. The mainspring’s tension physically manifests rising pressure. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Mara’s skilled observation and willingness to engage.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity—is signaled early and tightens when the bottled whisper threatens systemic collapse. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to fuse whisper with ink, triggering the rupture. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s perfect order fractures, books fall, and stability is sacrificed for wonder. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and conceptual density, not false coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cultural redefinition via the shard—is signaled early and deepens when Lira’s plan transforms dispute into collaboration. The meaningful tightening occurs during the storm: covering mirrors converts tools of communication into instruments of mythmaking. Cost is felt in Lira’s enduring sorrow and the foreclosed path of violent revolution. Though resolution leans on atmospheric convergence, agency remains hers—she times, recites, and ignites renewal. Coincidence (storms, time-veil) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her design harnesses them.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the village from sorrowful resonance—is signaled early and tightens at midnight’s approach, raising temporal pressure. Alder’s agency drives escalation: his humming, alignment of teeth, and use of the stone chip narrow options toward a single solution. Cost is visible: if he fails, shadows claim the chamber; success requires total adherence to truth. However, the threat remains abstract—no tangible consequence manifests beyond atmospheric unease—slightly muting visceral stakes despite elegant conceptual framing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—accessing the place where explanations fail—tightens meaningfully when Mara steps onto the water, risking dissolution for revelation. This act forecloses her archival past and crystallizes her stance: wonder over cataloguing. Cost is legible in the loss of her museum’s purpose and the compass’s absorption into the vortex. Escalation is driven by her agency (psychometry readings, stepping onto the lagoon), not coincidence, and pressure deepens via cadence shift from quiet observation to ritualistic immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming raw experience into luminous narrative—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from single-figure sculpture to layered tableau. The meaningful tightening occurs when she projects the slide onto the arch, binding past and present. Cost is felt: hours melt, the sea surrenders scarred wood, the lantern dims. Agency is clear—each carving strike syncs with turbine rhythm—but escalation relies more on textural accumulation than causal narrowing, fitting the lens yet limiting tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens into a confrontation with personal doubt. Pressure escalates texturally: from memory to physical journey to visionary encounter. The tightening occurs when Mara aligns the postcard with the glass—a deliberate act that unlocks the hidden cavity, transforming passive curiosity into active reckoning. Cost is felt (tears, relinquished winter) but not materially paid; still, under an Accumulative lens, the emotional price suffices. Coincidence is avoided; revelation arises from preparedness (postcards as keys).

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased testimony—is signaled early and deepens through the diary’s retrocognitive trap, which demands future memory to unlock past truth. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes via compassion, negotiates parley, arranges debris, and broadcasts findings. Cost is visible in the labor of nights on deck and the emotional toll of suppressed voices finally heard. However, the sand-carvers’ cooperation arrives with minimal friction, slightly softening oppositional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town through authentic memory—is signaled early and deepens when the alchemist rejects the bottle’s “soothing lies.” Pressure tightens through his method: each mental reconstruction requires recalling a lost name or song, narrowing options to laborious remembrance. Cost is visible: emotional exhaustion, solitude, and the risk of failure. Though stakes remain internal, they escalate coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a patient bloom rather than spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Harel realizes the prophecy *is* the pattern the council seeks. His agency drives escalation: immersion via memory leads to shaving wax, which releases the city’s sighs, which confirms the child’s identity. Cost is felt (“weight settle like dew”) though not catastrophic—appropriate for this lyrical scale. Coincidence (hearing the prophecy) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his interpretation and action earn the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reopening the covenant—is signaled early and tightens when Mira must “surrender the present.” Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her placement of the cap triggers the vortex, deepening pressure. Cost is conceptual (loss of linear time) but not visceral; no tangible forfeiture alters tactics. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, yet emotional price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—replacing chaotic noise with precise listening—is signaled early and tightens when the timer chimes: reattaching the rope too soon risks misreading the clouds. The tester’s agency drives escalation; his patience during the ten-minute wait narrows options (no rushing) and deepens stakes (faith in data over tradition). Cost is felt in the “retired hymn” of the old rope and the burden of future refinement. Coincidence never resolves; zero hour arrives through accumulated atmospheric cues, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability through empathic witness—is signaled early and deepens via the traced star paths. Escalation occurs texturally: the lantern flickers brighter, the ground trembles, the chord resonates. Agency lies in attention and vow-making, not physical action, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt as sustained emotional exposure, though it lacks tangible consequence beyond internal quiet fire.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving silence to prevent cosmic rupture—is signaled early and tightens when he deciphers the covenant’s beekeeper promise, raising the cost of speech. Agency manifests as renunciation, not action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres without coincidence; the ghosts’ alignment with the box deepens stakes without resolving them. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second escalation beat would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering time’s texture before the hourglass empties—is signaled early and deepens when the capsule pulses only after reuniting with the urn fragment. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers the ad, uncovers the hourglass, and completes the map. Cost is felt in the villagers’ collective anticipation and the irreversible shift in how time is measured, though the “borrowed-time” premise lacks concrete personal forfeiture beyond implied mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring incompleteness—is signaled early and deepens through the poet’s ritual of tending. The meaningful tightening occurs when he reframes ripples not as flaws but as “hidden hymns,” shifting his stance. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; external events (kite string snaps) complicate but don’t force hard choices. Cost is conceptual (rebellion against flawless endings) but not viscerally felt in action or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying human-imposed mortality through ecological harmony—is signaled early and deepens via Mara’s remodeling project. The meaningful tightening occurs when visitors begin to “answer the whisper of the pillars,” transforming passive observation into reciprocal ritual, which escalates communal investment. Agency is clear: Mara’s copper-wrapping initiates the resonance that ultimately reweights the council’s decree. However, the escalation leans more on accumulative texture than causal narrowing of options, slightly limiting pressure intensity under a strict Causal lens—but the Accumulative lens validates this approach.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding “chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early and deepens via Arin’s amber experiment. Pressure accumulates texturally (rain intensifying, scholars observing), but the key turn (alien echo matching amber) arrives via external resonance, not Arin’s agency. Cost is conceptual (rejecting awe for inquiry) but not felt viscerally; no tool, time, or relationship is lost. The tightening is lyrical, not tactical, which fits the Accumulative lens but lacks tangible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming war-scarred land through ancestral ecological ritual—is signaled early and deepens via the bird-call decoding system. Pressure tightens when specific trills trigger pod release, narrowing agency to auditory fidelity. Cost is felt: the reef’s death is irreversible, making renewal fragile. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (listening, speaking, scattering), though the absence of opposition risks static pressure; the story compensates through lyrical intensification under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with the dead through memory—is signaled early and deepens via the leaf’s discovery. Rook’s agency drives escalation: he positions the prism, barks to shift light, retrieves the leaf. Cost is conceptual: he accepts eternal guardianship, trading peace for burden. Yet pressure remains internalized; external opposition is absent, limiting situational tension despite strong thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding direction amid loss—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s act of sketching, which escalates from solitary gesture to shared ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when the first line aligns with the compass, confirming “true north still existed,” narrowing options from despair to active navigation. Agency drives escalation: the decision to lift the pen initiates the vision, and the choice to gather family charcoal sticks transforms personal endurance into collective exploration. Cost is felt in the “vacuum” of the silent city, yet stakes remain slightly abstract rather than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—amending the curse by releasing hidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens through each swap, which carries risk (vanishing ink, freezing resolve). Agency is clear: Lysander chooses each exchange, foreclosing easier paths. Cost is visible: stamina against cold, time before sunrise, emotional vulnerability (“cautious abandon”). The deepening—frost yielding to light—narrows options toward the final, irrevocable swap. Coincidence never resolves; the “wrong sky” enables but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased gestures—is signaled early and deepens when the scroll reveals specific acts of bravery. Mira’s agency drives escalation: first “remember what fell,” then “heal,” each step narrowing options toward public testimony. Cost is felt (“weight of those gestures settle on her shoulders”) and shapes tactics (using dust as medium). Coincidence never resolves; the hidden compartment responds to her earned action. Only slight softness in how the interregnum’s end connects to her mission prevents 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding home—is signaled early and tightens when memory becomes painful, forcing Lira to confront fracture rather than retreat. The deepening occurs when she presses the feather deeper, risking emotional rupture to unlock the hidden corridor. Agency is clear: her micro-choice to persist despite pain drives escalation. Cost is felt in the shattering of the courtyard image and the implied forfeiture of literal return; however, the absence of a second live option slightly softens the trade-off’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens via the labyrinth’s winnowing demand. Agency drives escalation: he actively decodes threads, arranges stones, visualizes his life-board. Cost is unmistakable—the sacrificed pawn dissolves, symbolizing irrevocable loss. However, stakes remain internalized; no external consequence or secondary pressure deepens the conflict beyond psychological terrain, limiting the escalation’s visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—paying the price of forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s escalating acts (sketches → poetry → mural → sky-line). Agency is clear: each refractive act narrows options until only shared confession remains. Cost (“acceptance of loss”) is legible in the glowing mural and townsfolk’s lifted weight. No false resolutions; escalation stems from protagonist’s choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through the alchemist’s escalating commitment to narration as resistance. Agency is clear: each uttered phrase stitches light, deepening pressure as the acid sea churns. The meaningful turn occurs when she aligns the charm with the fissure, narrowing options to speech alone. Cost is felt in the surrender of fear and the irreversible sealing of doubt, though the external threat (acid sea) resolves too neatly without lingering consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring a hidden promise to preserve fleeting beauty—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of the shell and key. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the oasis was a test of his “intimate aloofness,” forcing a crystallization of stance: detachment isn’t withdrawal but sacred attention. Agency is maintained throughout; the “wrong turn” complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt conceptually—the burden of eternal vigilance—but lacks a tangible forfeiture (e.g., lost time, health, connection), slightly softening the escalation’s bite under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s ritual. Escalation occurs via the cork’s unsealing and the sea’s resonant sigh, but agency is passive: she beckons, waits, watches. The fisherman’s arrival feels guided by magic, not Mara’s earned pressure. Cost remains conceptual; no path is foreclosed, no price visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping loss—is signaled early and tightens when the navigator builds the map-making engine, foreclosing passive mourning for active ritual. Escalation is driven by her agency: each midnight call deepens sorrow, each soldered joint confesses perseverance. The moon-phase constraint shapes tactics (waning = whisper, full = roar), and the cost—absorbed grief etched into copper—is unmistakable at closure. Coincidence never resolves; the ships’ arrival is earned through accumulated resonance, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety via forced honesty—is signaled early and deepens when smugglers confront their own reflections. Mara’s agency drives escalation: hiding the eye, then speaking truth, forecloses secrecy as an option. Cost is legible in smugglers’ silenced greed and the orchard’s new vulnerability. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification (storm + revelation) suffices, though the price feels more collective than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving a borrowed memory—is signaled early and deepens when Marlowe realizes the tide’s pauses encode poetry of loss. His agency is quiet but decisive: aligning the Edelweiss with the longest lull is a renunciation of passive observation for active memorialization. The cost is conceptual yet legible: he assumes the burden of remembrance, transforming his loneliness into purpose. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though the pressure remains internalized without external complication beyond the wind’s moan.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a promise to locate the doorway of decisions—is signaled early and deepens when Elian follows ants toward the fissure. Pressure escalates via environmental cues (creek rising, maps pulsing), but agency is passive; he reacts rather than contends. Cost is conceptual (redefining solitude as bridge), yet no tangible loss or irreversible forfeiture tightens the turn, softening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the dream—is signaled early and deepens into binding the starlight to the realm. The queen’s agency drives escalation: she commands, enters, touches the orb. Yet the “final warning” exerts no measurable pressure, and the retinue exerts zero opposition or complication. Cost is implied (lost dreams, spent secrets) but not viscerally felt; the kingdom’s relief arrives off-page as reported outcome, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming ephemeral presence into tangible light—is signaled early and tightens when brushes spark the shell’s hum. Agency lies in collective ritual, not individual choice, limiting personal cost. Escalation occurs through layered participation (adding breath, resolve), but pressure remains harmonious rather than conflicted, reducing felt risk despite beautiful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when the grave forces confrontation with mortality. The deepening occurs in the lucid dream: seeing his younger self chase the mist-fox crystallizes the cost of lost innocence. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to write, to reinterpret the grave—and the price (dissolved ambitions, irretrievable past) is unmistakable in the final lines. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening could more explicitly foreclose an alternative path beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—unveiling the miracle hidden in the clamp screw—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s tactile communion with the object. Escalation occurs via accumulation: fog thins, water rises, screw hums, sunrise appears—all synchronized with her emotional attunement. Though no external opposition exists, internal pressure builds through the demand of reverence. Cost is conceptual (the unspoken grief of lost smell, the burden of witnessing pain-turned-love) and legible in the final alignment of shop, body, and time.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars into healing stories—is signaled early and deepens through ritual pressure. The tightening occurs when Lira submerges the quill, crystallizing stress into light; this act narrows options from passive bearing to active release. Cost is felt: the feather dissolves, crystal remnants scatter like “whispered secrets.” Agency drives escalation—she chooses to burn, chant, write—but the conflict remains internal, limiting external pressure; still, under an Accumulative lens, this suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology—is signaled early and deepens as the orchard’s destruction looms, tightening options to a single ritual. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she arranges scores, activates the bottle, whispers the verse. Cost is felt (carrying “the weight of that ash”) and visible (trees falling), though the “induced currents” mechanism borders on convenient magic without clearer rules, slightly softening the pressure’s credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—seeing beyond false constellations—is signaled early and deepens through the spiral arbitration ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when the dictionary’s margins glow and form a map, forcing the protagonist to step into the unknown, trading physical stability for cosmic clarity. Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves conflict. However, cost remains conceptual (“vanished like a breath”) rather than viscerally felt, slightly muting the emotional weight of the trade-off under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—measuring the unmeasurable horizon—is signaled early and deepens when the shepherd realizes measurement requires participation, not observation. The tightening occurs at “count reached zero”: the hydraulic sigh dissolves the line, forcing reconfiguration. Agency is clear: his backward counting and whispered numbers drive the ritual; the cost is abandonment of objective data for subjective resonance. Pressure accumulates texturally (gear clicks, tidal pulses) rather than through external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the farm without disrupting its delicate ecology—is signaled early and tightens during the storm breach. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: calibrating the laser, interpreting spatial warps, deploying meshes. Cost is felt in the quiet burden of vigilance and the philosophical shift from control to flow. Though stakes are internalized, the storm provides external validation, ensuring pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling probability with chance—is signaled early and deepens via the subway descent, where each scrawl forces interpretive choices that narrow epistemic options. The tightening occurs when Mara accepts paradox as guide, enabling the phosphorescent map; this is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (abandoning strict certainty) and emotional (carrying grief), though not viscerally paid in the moment. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from sustained engagement with the system.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming endings into beginnings—is signaled early and deepens via each added voice to the loop. Pressure escalates texturally: Lena’s call tightens Mara’s purpose, and the accumulating chorus raises emotional stakes without external antagonism. The cost is felt in Mara’s dissolution of estrangement—a conceptual forfeiture made tangible in her final step out of the booth. Agency lies in attention and curation, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile memories against time’s erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the act of writing as covenant renewal. The meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist links the child’s grin to the lighthouse pact, transforming personal memento into communal anchor. Yet escalation relies on lyrical assertion (“through proximate causes he linked…”) rather than dramatized agency; the sea’s “chant” responds passively, not as opposition. Cost is felt emotionally (“dread and delight”) but never materializes as lost opportunity, exhaustion, or failed preservation—keeping stakes ethereal rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when the moon rock’s true function (catalyst, not potion) reframes the mission. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Lira gathers volunteers, hacks contraptions, cuts ivy, and sends the fragment onward. The meaningful tightening is conceptual: shifting from possession to circulation. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of the rock, though not viscerally dramatized; the price is opportunity (she doesn’t keep it) rather than tangible loss. Coincidence (rumor chains) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens via the forest’s escalating “musical notes” that demand unwavering attention. Agency lies in Lira’s choice to follow the melody despite risk; the cost is the surrender of old mapping paradigms. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each vibration tightens focus until the stillpoint forces conceptual surrender. No false resolutions—luck never intervenes; the climax arises solely from sustained attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—correcting past error without losing identity—is signaled early and deepens via the anomaly’s intensifying pull. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: choosing to “weave new connections” despite dry ink, risking further chaos. Cost is legible in the “threshed” effort and emotional toll (“strange comfort” masking lingering uncertainty). Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via cadence shift from chaos (“tangled ribbons”) to order (“orderly rows”), with one decisive deepening—the pen’s trail activating corrected data—that narrows possibility space meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music for the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through Arlen’s ritual and Lira’s continuation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Arlen “disrupts the harbor’s natural rhythm,” inserting sign-derived cadence, which forecloses passive observation in favor of active creation. Cost is legible: joyful sorrow, the bittersweet weight of crafting beauty from absence. Agency is clear, though escalation leans more accumulative than causal; still, pressure coheres under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the mentor’s promise—is signaled early and tightens when the self-portrait reveals a map, narrowing options to artistic trail. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each creation deepens his commitment, culminating in the bronze box. Cost is felt: his past destruction haunts him via the vandalized eyes, and redemption demands public portrayal, not private atonement. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his intuitive reading.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming sterile observation into shared dreaming—is signaled early and tightens when Lira drums, escalating to systemic change in lab protocol. Agency is clear: her defiance initiates shockwaves that reconfigure reality. Cost is felt conceptually (abandonment of experimental treatment) and emotionally (sorrow transmuted to hope), though not viscerally personal. The single meaningful deepening—staff awakening to shared longing—is earned by Lira’s sustained action, not coincidence, satisfying Accumulative escalation under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and deepens through Milo’s ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he places the coin, follows the map, activates the radio, and unlocks the box. The tightening occurs when the map rearranges to guide him, narrowing options to one path. Cost is conceptual (time, belief) rather than material, but the final image makes it felt: the slammed container door echoes a futile shout, underscoring the price of noise.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (“teach darkness the value of stars”) is signaled early but never faces tangible opposition or risk—darkness is passive, not resistant. No meaningful tightening forecloses options; the guardian’s method proceeds uninterrupted. Cost is implied (patience, calm) but never dramatized as sacrifice. Escalation is textural, not agential, failing the 8.0+ gate for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming rote education into curiosity—is signaled early and deepens when synchronized displays draw neighbors into “unvoiced dialogue.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she organizes, watches, whispers, and cradles the grotto as rebellion incarnate. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: the town abandons noise for listening, the mayor renounces dismissal, and children trade tables for shared silence. One meaningful tightening occurs at the final pulse, which crystallizes collective stance—but lacks a personal sacrifice that would heighten emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-embrace—is signaled early and deepens when the scrimshaw cracks, forcing Mara to choose between possession and release. The tightening occurs when the whale’s call demands action, narrowing her path to ritual surrender. Cost is felt: relinquishing the heirloom unlocks not just the island but her own guarded heart. Agency drives escalation, though the whale’s role borders on convenient catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—expressing grief under a joy mandate—is signaled early and tightens through Mara’s whittling, which risks violation yet asserts quiet defiance. The meaningful deepening occurs when narration shifts from performance to prayer-like ritual, raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt (emotional void, isolation) but not concretely dangerous; escalation relies on internal pressure rather than external consequence, slightly limiting tension under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolving sacred boundaries—is signaled early and deepens via the poet’s paraphrasing act, which triggers environmental transformation. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → hum → crack → glow. Cost is conceptual (collapse of ancient prohibitions) and felt (the tremor settling into pulse). Agency is clear, though the lack of tangible opposition softens the escalation slightly; stakes remain abstract despite vivid embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—trading awakenings to mend fractured sight—is signaled early and tightens through escalating barter: rosemary/cactus yields teal; ivy/lotus births glass flora. Each transaction narrows Selene’s path from seeking external perfection to embracing internal fracture, culminating in Charged Poise: arranging cereus to harvest the phoenix’s cry. Cost is legible—she sacrifices control for ephemeral insight—and agency drives every escalation. Coincidence never resolves; the phoenix’s rebirth merely sets conditions Selene actively exploits through plant arrangements.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forging connection through engineered perception—is signaled early and deepens via the bell ringer’s rejection of replacing human travel, focusing instead on “immediate texture.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the artificial mind’s sigh syncs with the ringer’s heartbeat, dissolving isolation. Cost is felt (“warm yet delicate” imprint) but remains conceptual; a more visceral forfeiture (e.g., physical toll, irreversible system change) would elevate escalation. Agency is consistent, though stakes stay safely abstract rather than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—remapping decay into renewal—is signaled early and tightened through the crane-folding ritual, which forecloses passive mourning. Agency lies in attention and ceremonial placement; each origami figure narrows her path from isolation to transmission. Cost is felt in “fingers stained with copper and grief” and the wilted rose’s fragility. Escalation is driven by her choices under an Accumulative lens, though the stakes’ physical manifestation (silver thread tracing) verges on convenience without clearer constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering hidden symmetries to blueprint hope—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she multiplies trade routes with meme trajectories, traces spirals, records measurements. The tightening occurs when the tape snaps, marking a “break in the pattern where hope could be re-stitched,” foreclosing passive observation for active weaving. Cost is felt (“weight of inherited mystery”) and conceptual (rebuilding from collapse). However, external pressure remains abstract—the city’s “tentative rhythm” isn’t dramatized as opposition, slightly muting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge through pattern avoidance—is signaled early and deepens via the historian’s physical enactment of irregular cadence. The meaningful tightening occurs when the pagoda flickers in response to his non-rhythmic steps, raising stakes from curiosity to soul-level transformation. Cost is legible: he bears the weight of reclaimed heritage, weeping not from loss but bittersweet reclamation. However, external opposition is absent, limiting conflict to internal/situational pressure, which slightly caps escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist witnesses mirrored silhouettes across decades, forcing a metamorphosis of perception. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to align stone and screen, transforming passive observation into active preservation. Cost is felt in “luminous regret” for lost moments and crystallized in the stone’s captured shadows. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though a second pressure point would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing trust after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s layered shedding. Agency is clear: her choices (returning the tail, arranging lies as debris) narrow options by committing to vulnerability. Cost is felt (fragile convictions, social fallout), though the antagonist (the con) remains off-stage, slightly muting external pressure. Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens, with one decisive intensification: the tail’s reattachment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering scar stories—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of the “displaced miracle,” raising emotional stakes from personal closure to historical restitution. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: turning the hourglass, descending the tunnel, interpreting coffee rings. Cost is legible in the years of unresolved pain finally harmonizing—but the resolution leans slightly on plant-guided revelation rather than fully earned struggle, softening pressure just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when letters become a map. The tightening occurs when the film strip expands into a labyrinth, raising emotional stakes. Agency is present (humming, pressing the strip), but escalation leans on coincidence (hidden compartment revealed by vibration). Cost is conceptual (“echo of a heart that never learned to speak”) yet lacks a tangible forfeiture, softening the pressure just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens through the act of tracing, which transforms silence into verse. Pressure accumulates texturally: each traced star intensifies the “unheard verses” until the final release. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses a live option; the dreamer never faces a trade-off or irreversible loss. The cost (fatigue, solitude) is felt but not dramatized as altering tactics—his method proceeds uninterrupted, weakening causal pressure under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks to regrow forests—is signaled early and deepens via the charm’s activation, which narrows options to ritual action. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his whisper aligns the clock, unfolds the archive, and releases potential. Cost is felt conceptually (reversed time, irreversible commitment to renewal) and emotionally (longing amid dreamlessness), though no tangible forfeiture occurs. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift—from frozen stasis to ticking reversal—sufficiently reweights the stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the mind’s wild frontier—is signaled early and deepens via the gear’s use. Pressure escalates texturally: each layer of wind-song tightens focus until the hidden spring is found. The protagonist’s agency drives the climax (placing the gear), incurring conceptual cost—abandoning the quest for external marvels. However, stakes remain abstract; no tangible loss (time, stamina, social credit) alters tactics. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, but the absence of a felt trade-off limits escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens through the ferry’s indirect method, which mirrors Mira’s internal path. The meaningful tightening occurs when the ferry turns back at the moon’s shyness, reinforcing that progress isn’t linear. Cost is felt in the lost leash and years of waiting, though it’s emotional rather than tactical. Agency is present but passive; Mira follows rather than drives, limiting escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“cost of safety”) tightens when the bolt’s placement deepens the discoloration—a tangible trade-off between silence and guidance. Pressure escalates texturally: snowfall’s “soft footfall” contrasts the “unpardonable silence,” forcing the guests’ alignment with the fortress’s rhythm. Agency is subtle but present—the bellhop’s offering and the guests’ choice to watch constitute renunciation that forecloses warmth, with cost felt in their “frostbitten hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and escalates coherently: from decoding a rune to confronting spectral sovereignty. The titan’s agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves tension. Pressure tightens when the floor sundered, forcing immediate stakes crystallization. A visible cost emerges: the library’s destruction and the ink pellet’s irreversible expenditure. One tightening suffices, but here it’s layered with environmental and symbolic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost marine paths—is signaled early and tightens when the watermark aligns with the canyon, narrowing options to verification via sound. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mara’s belief and Eli’s deliberate tap produce the resonant note that confirms the conduit. Cost is legible—the reefs’ directional loss is irreversible, yet their work offers future restoration. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reigniting meaning in broken dreams—is signaled early and deepens through the glyph-stone resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when the hum cracks the rebellion’s lull, forcing action. Yet agency is ambiguous: does she *cause* the ignition or merely witness/attune? The cost is conceptual (enduring silence, solitude) but not viscerally dramatized—no tool lost, time forfeited, or relationship strained. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening works, but stakes remain abstract rather than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to unseal the embryo—tightens when Anara decodes the kite’s script, forcing sacrifice of memory. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her telepathy guides glyph interpretation, which triggers the vapor column. Cost is unmistakable: loss of maternal lullabies alters her identity. Coincidence (finding kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the ritual’s success hinges on her choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—anchoring hope in tragedy—is signaled early and tightens when she kneels to the scarred oak, crystallizing purpose. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing stillness, smoothing the photo, whispering a vow. Cost is felt: she freezes grief only for “a heartbeat,” implying ongoing labor. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the sapling scene deepens stakes without new conflict—efficient for length. No false resolution; hope remains fragile, rooted in cracked soil.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can broken art capture whole souls?—is signaled early and deepens when Elian chooses to “untangle threads” instead of discard cards. The descent into darkness is a meaningful tightening that forecloses his old method, with visible cost: surrendering the illusion of completeness. Pressure accumulates texturally (not causally), consistent with the lens, though the protagonist’s agency in escalation is slightly passive—he follows the spiral rather than decisively initiates the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why time slows—is signaled immediately and deepens when Kael realizes the pause is a “deliberate deferral.” The escalation occurs through his own action: releasing ink triggers dissolution of self, raising stakes from intellectual quest to existential risk. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—those who ignore the pause face oblivion. Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus stability—is signaled early and deepens when the letter ignites, narrowing Maren’s options to irreversible exposure. Agency is clear: her insertion of the letter drives escalation, and the resulting tremor forces the council’s hand. Cost is legible in the councilor’s marrow-deep recognition and Maren’s acceptance of potential preservation-loss. Though stakes are high, they remain viscerally grounded in contraband ink and network ripples, not abstract polity collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“weaving continuity through chaos”—is clear but never truly contested; no opposing force or internal doubt pressures Lira’s mission. The only tightening occurs when she gives the boy a petal, but this deepens theme more than stakes. Cost is conceptual (weight of past) rather than dramatized loss or sacrifice, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—to catch the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens into a thematic trade-off: possession vs. liberation. Escalation occurs through the fisher’s agency: lowering the spike, shouting the chant, releasing the echo. Cost is unmistakable in the final renunciation, which forecloses trapping the divine. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory density and pattern rupture (“when patterns break themselves”), culminating in a Charged Poise where options crystallize without physical confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing buried truth—is signaled early and tightens when Mira inputs her hypothesis, forcing the system to eliminate false premises. Agency is clear: her logical method drives escalation, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but legible: the “orbits of regret” begin unwinding, implying systemic upheaval. However, the pressure remains largely intellectual; no tangible sacrifice (time, safety, relationship) alters her tactics, limiting felt stakes despite elegant thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt through translated cries—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra confronts haunted firmware, narrowing her path to one fragile ritual. Agency is clear: she chooses to tether sorrow via amber, paying the cost of vulnerability. The escalation hinges on her decoding maternal letters, a credible deepening that alters knowledge and tactics under Accumulative pressure, though the firmware’s “response” leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in scattered thoughts—tightens when Liora’s chalk spiral becomes conduit for hush, foreclosing noisy interpretation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each drawn line deepens resonance until the tile lifts. Cost is felt as relinquished control (legacy now “echoed,” not authored), though the violinist shard slightly dilutes pressure by introducing external validation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the violinist’s arrival extends rather than concludes the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—forging aberrant mercy that survives rebuilt towers—is signaled early and deepens through the radical’s tactile engagement with the mosaic. The meaningful tightening occurs when he senses the answer lies in the stone’s pattern, narrowing his mission to linguistic creation. Cost is conceptual (dissolving retrocognitive loops) and social (offering stark calm to survivors), though not viscerally dramatized. Escalation is driven by accumulation, not agency under pressure—the stone “speaks” to him rather than his struggle extracting meaning—limiting the score despite coherent thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending a fractured timeline to reclaim artistic legacy—is signaled early and deepens into a broader yearning to “lure possibility from the brink.” Pressure escalates via the ghost’s agency: he sings, amplifies echoes, and invites the orchard’s response. The shopkeeper’s entrance introduces human witness, raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt in the ghost’s surrender of selfhood for resonance, though the mechanics of timeline repair remain metaphorical rather than causally tight. Coincidence (her wandering in) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the ghost’s actions still drive the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—testing whether intention can translate to color without drugs—is signaled early and deepens when the static shock triggers recall. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she programs LEDs, maps pulses to skin, and closes eyes to summon shared thought. The cost is conceptual (abandoning rigid skepticism) and felt in the “willowglass hope.” However, the external pressure remains internalized; a stronger oppositional force would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unknown—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual’s intensification. The map maker’s agency drives escalation: each droplet release tightens the connection between sea sorrow and human absence. Cost is conceptual but legible: the altered coastline, calmer water, and new song imply irreversible change. While pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, the lack of tangible sacrifice (time, tool, safety) keeps the price oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the prophecy to reverse time—is signaled early and tightens when button-jar resonance begins. Mara’s agency drives escalation: cataloging → placing buttons → pouring sand. The cost is conceptual (rewriting time’s rules) and felt in the weight of grains aligning. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo sings a matching line, narrowing options to physical arrangement. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Mara’s choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—fixing broken trust through locating “unused courage”—is signaled early and deepens when reframed as an internal state. Pressure escalates via the spy’s nightly coding and decoding, but the turning point (altar activation) relies more on mystical convergence than protagonist-driven agency. Cost is emotional (guilt, isolation) but lacks tangible consequence; no option is visibly foreclosed. The “prudently daring” trait informs his approach yet doesn’t force a hard trade-off, softening the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—distilling complexity into a single stitch—is signaled early and deepens via the ticking countdown, which tightens temporal pressure. The protagonist’s agency lies in sustained attention, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. However, the “tightening” lacks a visible price: no stamina loss, missed opportunity, or tool failure alters tactics. The cost is conceptual (letting go of regret), legible but not dramatized through concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s interaction with the lantern and timelines. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual, culminating in a meaningful tightening: she offers kindness, which awakens the hive. Cost is felt (the oasis’s fragility, the risk of failed listening), though the escalation leans more atmospheric than causal. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies credibly via sensory and temporal layering.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—imbuing darkness with gentle light—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s ritualized planting. Pressure escalates texturally (not causally), as the vines’ glow pushes back shadows and even silences gulls. Yet the conflict remains abstract; no tangible obstacle tests her resolve, and the “cost” is atmospheric rather than dramatized. Agency is present but unchallenged, limiting escalation to mood rather than meaningful consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into communal agency—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual at the stone circle. Pressure escalates texturally: dormant scripts awaken, the sky-whale appears, the library breathes. The cost is conceptual but legible: Mira surrenders the safety of solitary study for uncertain interdependence. However, escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than protagonist-driven tactical shifts, slightly softening agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unsent love—is signaled early and deepens when the spiral responds, raising the stakes from private yearning to cosmic participation. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she whispers, steps onto the spiral, places the petal—all choices that narrow her path toward surrender. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing ownership of her words) but rendered undeniable in the mosaic’s glow and the temple’s acceptance. Coincidence (the falling petal) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mira’s action completes the circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—balancing celestial chaos against human unity—is signaled early and tightens when Mara risks drowning campus news. Her agency drives escalation: custom algorithm → subsonic broadcast → valley-wide chorus. Cost is felt in persistent vigilance (“forever listening”) and implied exhaustion. However, the tricksters’ threat lacks tangible consequence beyond abstract “power plays,” softening the trade-off’s visceral weight. Coincidence nearly resolves tension (dean’s assembly), but Mara’s interference preempts it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the key to combat cultural forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when claustrophobia wars with resolve in the unfolding corridor. The explorer’s agency drives escalation: he aligns the compass, whispers the incantation, steps forward. Cost is felt in breath, fear, and sensory overload, culminating in the bittersweet organ surge. While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the “fallow period” timeframe exerts minimal tactical influence—it’s atmospheric, not constraining—slightly weakening escalation’s causal grip.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting forgotten victims through non-visual empathy—is signaled early and tightens when the child’s name appears on the ribbon. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her brushwork literally cracks the mist. Cost is felt in her reawakened vulnerability. Yet the “evidence disappears” premise exerts little tactical pressure; time feels atmospheric, not urgent, slightly muting stakes despite strong emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked bravery—is signaled early and deepens when the storm threatens erasure. Mara’s agency drives escalation: decoding stanzas, retrieving the nail, rallying crew. The vortex raises physical stakes while the moral compass metaphor sharpens ethical calculus. Cost is felt in “spongey dread” settling into resolve—a visible trade-off between safety and legacy—but the crew’s offstage presence slightly softens interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—activating pixelated amnesty to recover the lost hitchhiker—is signaled early and deepens when the fiddler realizes it’s a “doorway to re-write what never was.” Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: he treks, plays, exposes the plate. Cost is felt (“weight… like ash”) and conceptual (rewriting impossibility). Yet escalation leans on atmospheric accumulation over concrete narrowing of options; the “secret map” guides without resistance, reducing tactical friction. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but the world’s magic operates without established rules tested under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether human journeys should be bounded or free—is signaled early and deepens when Maya challenges Arlen’s markers. The meaningful tightening occurs when Arlen asserts that even circus performance needs safety rails, foreclosing unstructured exploration in favor of guided discovery. Cost is felt: the startup’s eventual crash validates his caution but also isolates his insight until the end. Escalation is driven by Arlen’s agency, though the external pressure (investor frenzy, server stalls) borders on summary rather than dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple through shared burdens—is signaled early and deepens via the telegram’s directive. Pressure accumulates texturally: each star pulse, dream residue, and whispered phrase tightens the thematic coil. The cost is conceptual (the ache of secrecy) and felt (doubt fracturing then mending), though not physically dramatized. Agency lies in attention and voice, which under the Accumulative lens suffices, but lacks a decisive trade-off that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing a frozen confession to restore truth—is signaled early and deepens through the druid’s methodical ritual. Escalation occurs via her chant’s ripple effect, which actively pulls ice inward, shattering the confession with war-drum rhythm. Cost is legible in the seed’s redirected hunger and the druid’s shift from guardedness to openness. Yet the conflict lacks external opposition or internal doubt; pressure remains atmospheric rather than adversarial, limiting tactical complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the eclipsed covenant to bind collective longing—is signaled early and deepens when the visionary learns it’s about “dream to duty,” not power. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the maze responds passively to touch, the portal appears by ritual, not sacrifice. Cost is conceptual (“scars of history”) but not visceral; no tool lost, time spent, or belief shattered alters tactics. The “anxious elation” never confronts a counter-force that tightens options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending the soul through bartered hope—is signaled early and deepens when Maelia realizes destinies are “stitches” of shared renewal. Escalation occurs via her agency: each sigil, each application of ash, tightens the weave between self and orchard. The cost is felt in the card’s dissolution and the burden’s transmutation, culminating in a visible price: she carries the amber thread like a lantern, implying ongoing responsibility. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and cadence shift, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s methodical cataloguing, which both shields and reveals vulnerability. The meaningful deepening occurs when concrete clatter triggers memory, shifting focus from defense to possibility. Agency is subtle but present: choosing to examine, to wrap the cloth, to write the ledger entry. Cost is felt (shame, isolation) and visible in the refusal to flee; instead, he stays, inspects, and reinterprets. Under an Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming haunted ambition into shared understanding—is signaled early and tightens when Lira chooses to plant the seed on a specific resonant twig, risking failure. The escalation is driven by her agency: whispering verses, mapping glyphs to pulses, observing fluctuations. Cost is conceptual but legible: the departed spirit cannot return; her old solitary climb is foreclosed. The final decision to journey downward represents a deepening—testing whether insight can survive outside its ideal conditions—raising the stakes from personal resolution to communal legacy. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from her analogical method.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—tightens after “tomorrow disappeared,” forcing the librarian to forge a new key. His agency drives escalation: smelting memory, accepting contradictions, opening blank volumes. Cost is felt (“gears soften”) and conceptual (identity must migrate). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one deepening (post-calendar rupture) suffices for length. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—only his choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming abandoned hopes—is signaled early and deepens through confessions. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than agentic; Mara reacts, not acts, until the end. The “heartbeat of hesitation” implies time pressure but doesn’t alter tactics. Cost is felt conceptually (sealed bunker vs. inner communion) but not viscerally borne by Mara. The tightening is tonal, not tactical, limiting stakes’ dramatic traction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens via the graffiti’s wisdom and river encounter. Pressure escalates texturally: from observation to confession to promise. The tightening occurs when the narrator draws a new map in mud—a renunciation of passivity—but the cost remains abstract (“fragile stone”) rather than concrete (lost time, health, relationship). Agency is present but internalized; no external consequence tests the stakes beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—to find the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens into documenting it for posterity. Pressure escalates texturally through recurring reversals and resonance patterns, but agency is passive: discoveries happen *to* the characters rather than through hard-won choices that foreclose options. Cost is conceptual (time, attention) but not viscerally felt; no path is truly lost, only revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—is signaled early and tightens as the promise’s glow fades. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets stains, aligns violin, chooses rebellion. The vines’ protest adds moral pressure, and the envoy’s presence crystallizes the moment. Cost is felt (shared “mulberry ache”) but not fully dramatized as personal sacrifice—Elara loses nothing tangible, only bears witness. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of symbolic stakes suffices for high-band impact.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s method (finding patterns in static), which narrows options to precise brushwork. Escalation occurs through rhythmic intensification: static hum → lattice formation → flare. Cost is felt (aurora dims) but not paid by the protagonist—she endures no personal loss, weakening agency. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, but the absence of tangible trade-off caps escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes it lies not in discovery but in tending. The tightening occurs at the altar: aligning the hairpin isn’t magic but a catalyst for internal reconfiguration, foreclosing her search and committing her to care. Cost is felt (the end of seeking) and visible (her return to vines), though escalation relies more on accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—welcoming nuance into certainty—is signaled early and tightens when Mara deciphers the chime rhythm, linking each note to the magistrate’s doubts. Her agency drives escalation: placing the shard, unhooking the knot. The cost is felt: certainty cracks, replaced by the “cloak of doubt” as mantle, not burden. Though conflict is internalized, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights the law’s rigidity into dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—transforming reverse aging from curse to gift—are signaled early and deepen through Mira’s active choice to withhold perception. The tightening occurs when she resists the urge to see her future self prematurely, trading immediate knowledge for earned wisdom. Cost is unmistakable: years of isolation, the tension of waiting while time peels backward, and the vulnerability of stepping into the grotto blind. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens when the arrowhead’s resonance aligns with the birds’ spirals, narrowing her options to pure internal attunement. Agency lies in attention and interpretation, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the “weathered resolve” and centuries of inherited burden, though the escalation lacks a tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a tool or relationship). Still, pressure coheres and tightens toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding sacred simplicity in a mechanized world—is signaled early and deepens when Selric unstraps his spellbook, symbolically shedding expectation. The tightening occurs at the ledge: mist-walking demands faith in impossibility, narrowing options to surrender or retreat. Cost is felt in his relinquished identity (“underachieving mage” dissolves), though the lack of tangible loss (e.g., physical toll, irreversible sacrifice) slightly softens escalation. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating vibration into hue—is signaled early and deepens when the library manifests it literally. Pressure escalates texturally: from city’s lantern release (collective hope) to Eli’s solitary descent (personal truth). The tightening occurs when he opens the glowing tome—no turning back. Cost is conceptual: he gains knowledge but assumes eternal seeker status, foreclosing ordinary life. Agency is clear; coincidence never resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices, though escalation leans more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—aligning with purpose via decoding the backwards prophecy—is signaled early and deepens through Silas’s distillation of static bursts. The meaningful tightening occurs when the final pop triggers the instruction, narrowing his action to one decisive gesture: turning the last coin. Cost is conceptual (accepting doubt as part of alignment) and visible in the cracked glass. Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves tension. Under the Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though a second tactical trade-off would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears to redeem sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens through each crystal’s revelation. Agency is clear: Lira chooses to speak names despite heartbreak, foreclosing perpetual mourning. Cost is legible in the “weight of centuries” shed and the aurora’s ascent. Escalation follows an accumulative rhythm (more names → more light), consistent with the inferred lens, though pressure remains internal rather than externally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance via the bell—is signaled early and tightens when dripping irregularity forces precise measurement. The mage’s agency drives escalation: his choice to trust droplet rhythm deepens pressure, narrowing options to exact timing. Cost is conceptual (risk of shattered devotion) but legible in the bell’s fragility. Coincidence never resolves; harmony emerges only through earned alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—replacing myth with truth—is signaled early and deepens through photo revelations, culminating in communal catharsis. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the photos simply appear, and the “clandestine trade” detail resolves the mystery without Caitlyn overcoming resistance or paying a personal price. The cost is collective relief, not individual sacrifice, diluting felt stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is clear from the outset and tightens when the crystal thaws, forcing Selene to act before full transformation. Agency is present (channeling starlings, arranging shards), but escalation leans on atmospheric intensification rather than hard trade-offs; the “cost” remains abstract until the sentimental surge, which feels earned yet lightly borne. Still, the amber flame shift marks a decisive reweighting under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust under pressure—is signaled early and tightens when the radio fails, forcing ascent. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to revise, recalls knots via muscle memory, and accepts burden. Cost is felt (heavier shoulders, fractional lift) and visible (repaired buckle as symbol). Yet pressure remains internalized; the storm is backdrop, not active antagonist, limiting external consequence. Coincidence (static clearing just after repair) borders on convenient but is framed as response to effort, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—emotional vivification through reconciling original/duplicate—is signaled early and deepens when Kael chooses action over factional debate. The tightening occurs at the blade swing: options narrow from custody battle to coexistence, with cost (shattered glass, ideological surrender). Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency under an Accumulative lens—pressure builds via sensory and factional noise until his silent resolution crystallizes stance. Syndicate/Guardians apply immediate secondary pressure, though their voices blur slightly in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—nurturing a living puzzle that blooms through collective problem-solving—is signaled early and deepens via the seed’s environmental receptivity. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each solved riddle triggers airflow, tightening the causal chain toward bloom. The final gust and cracking husk deliver a decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual yet legible: Mara risks her reputation and creative space on an untested, fragile idea, and the participants’ awe validates her gamble—but the price of failure (a dead seed, wasted trust) hovers implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens via the conductor’s escalating acts: whispering, pulling the cord, guiding gusts toward embers of joy. Agency drives escalation; each use of the blower narrows silence’s dominance. Cost is visible: his mournful eagerness exacts emotional toll, culminating in tearful gratitude and vanishing. The off-key wind complicates but doesn’t resolve—victory emerges from persistent tending, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making friends with uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant offers a pact of uncertainty. The guardian’s agency lies in renunciation: choosing to wait despite temptation, which narrows options and crystallizes stance. Cost is felt (“fierce patience a shield against inevitable collapse”), though the cult’s off-page presence slightly dilutes immediate antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interrupting stifling destiny via vivifying the crozier—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at each penny drop, narrowing options to precise elixir adjustments. Agency is clear: the alchemist’s successive approximations drive escalation, with visible cost in repeated failure and emotional exhaustion. The final trade-off—accepting that rebirth requires further tearing—deepens the conflict under an Accumulative lens. Coincidence (penny drops) complicates timing but never resolves; victory stems solely from persistent, measured ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reinterpreting decay as renewal—is signaled early and deepens when Selin discards linear assumptions, narrowing options to one risky act: interfacing the shard. Agency drives escalation: her whisper (“find the beginning in every ending”) triggers the tower’s response, and broadcasting the chord costs nothing but effort, yet reweights all prior silence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—static becomes melody through her choices, not luck. Coincidence (lunar perigee) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the moon amplifies, but Selin engineers wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming vanished time—is signaled early and tightens when Lio broadcasts the tone, narrowing options to resonance or oblivion. Escalation is driven by his agency (choosing sound over passivity), and cost is felt in the “flickering timelines” and stranded passengers. Though coincidence (moon falling like a coin) complicates, resolution stems from Lio’s patterned intention, not luck. A sharper tactical trade-off (e.g., sacrificing something personal) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens through rhythmic intensification: color eruptions, fractal arches, golden rain. Agency is expressed through weaving, a method that actively reweights the gallery’s illusions. The cost is conceptual but felt: the realization that connections are “both material and imagined,” paid for through sustained attention and craft. While pressure coheres beautifully, the absence of external opposition or tangible loss slightly softens the escalation’s bite, though this fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—navigating by alien-modified starlight—is signaled early and deepens when edge geometry transforms theory into testable vectors. The meaningful tightening occurs when the first vessel slips past coral arches, proving the method works but demanding cultural shift (scholars revising curricula). Cost is conceptual: the city exhales “somber marvel,” acknowledging loss of old ways. Yet escalation leans on collective awe rather than individual agency; Mira observes success more than she wrestles consequence, slightly muting protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—ensuring vulnerable voices aren’t lost—is signaled early and deepens when the street singer’s wartime role is revealed. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each scan leads to a new beat, culminating in the alcove discovery. Cost is conceptual but legible: the protagonist assumes eternal guardianship, foreclosing anonymity or detachment. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and emotional density rather than causal narrowing, which fits the design—but the lack of tangible sacrifice (time, safety, tool loss) slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mara risks dimensional void for the codex’s promise. Escalation is driven by her agency: aligning the codex, whispering the sequence. Cost is felt: she endures claustrophobic dread and accepts permanent separation from the artifact. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and textual density rather than causal reversals, which is valid—but the absence of a second tangible loss (e.g., physical toll) slightly limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—correcting the miscounted death—is clear from the first paragraph and tightens when the ghost’s tally threatens to overwrite Mara’s mind. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses ink, shard, defragmentation, not passive waiting. Cost is felt in the ghost’s absorption and the shard’s transformation. Coincidence (radio static clearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from her ritualized labor.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving a dying language through sonic translation—is signaled early and tightens when the storyteller realizes he needs a binding pattern. His agency drives escalation: observing birds, inviting the diamond to listen, tracing arcs. The meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond cracks, releasing chimes that merge with avian cries—a trade-off where cursed power enables creation but ensures impermanence. Cost is felt: the language survives only as secret resonance, inaccessible to living tongues.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming sorrow into levity—is signaled early and tightens when the arrowhead shatters, forcing irreversible commitment. Agency drives escalation: placing the artifact triggers the metamorphosis. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the arrowhead, dissolution of professional detachment, and acceptance of shared cosmic absurdity as redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty against mechanical monotony—is signaled early and tightens when the bronze statue demands silence, forcing the violinist’s single-note rebellion. Escalation is driven by his agency: heartbeat signals → shell clicks → root eruption. Cost is felt in the statues’ trembling resolve and his eventual departure, though the regime’s defeat lacks tangible consequence beyond softened gears. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (statues’ shift from opposition to alliance) suffices, but the mechanical world’s transformation feels slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fostering peace by linking absences—is signaled early and deepens when the storm blinds the drone, forcing tactical adaptation. Milo’s agency drives escalation: his whisper, placement, and envelope insertion are decisive under pressure. Cost is felt in the “dust of old grudges” washed away—a quiet forfeiture of entrenched hostility. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the rival drone’s arrival feels earned by the first act’s success, though its calm descent slightly softens the prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming silence into song—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s persistent singing, which incurs the cost of perpetual responsibility (“keep the quiet alive”). Escalation occurs via density: each added layer (fog, tickets, map, cavern) tightens the thematic pressure without narrowing physical options. Yet the conflict lacks tangible opposition; the train yields too readily, making the “struggle” feel atmospheric rather than adversarial. The cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) but not viscerally felt in bodily or material sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reawakening analog memory—is signaled early and deepens through hyperbolic alignment, culminating in a shared communal experience among patrons. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mara actively traces lines, whispers algorithms, and adjusts the scarf. Cost is felt—the miracle is transient, requiring “delicate balance”—but remains abstract; no concrete forfeiture (time, energy, personal memory) is dramatized, slightly muting escalation’s bite under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting lost dreams through light—is signaled early and deepens when Lio’s net catches not fish but “shimmering filament,” proving the cipher’s reach. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Mara’s mixing of pigments and shutter press vitalizes the dream, which then alters Lio’s behavior. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift from solitude to collaboration, foreclosing Mara’s prior isolation. However, the filament’s dissolution lacks tangible consequence beyond scent, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea from fear—is signaled early and deepens through the locksmith’s improbable longing. Escalation occurs via sensory and spatial disorientation, culminating in the ribbon’s release, which narrows options to a single decisive act. Cost is conceptual (the relinquishing of the hair as relic), felt in the lingering filament. However, agency leans passive; the wind provides the key insight, reducing protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes memories are hidden, not lost. Agency is clear: she traces constellations, arranges caps, lifts the sextant. The meaningful tightening occurs at the central wreck: the cracked sextant confirms the mushroom’s role, narrowing her method to fungal alignment. Cost is felt—decades of absence, salt-drowned soil—but could be more viscerally tied to a personal sacrifice beyond time elapsed.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ending the reversible exile—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s escalating acts of annotation. Pressure tightens when a sudden crack triggers her backward step, forcing her to confront lingering fear before choosing gentle mentorship over retreat. The cost is felt: her tremor fades only through repeated, vulnerable engagement. While coincidence (sun’s precise angle) complicates, resolution stems from her agency—decoding leaf geometry, placing the shadow-glass—making escalation earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the traveler arrives, demanding exportation of hope. The pruner’s agency is clear: he sings to storms, offers a sprig, tends the chorus. Yet escalation lacks narrowing of options; the world expands rather than constricts. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) but not viscerally felt in a decisive trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, though a sharper tactical price would strengthen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits through quiet restoration—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s unraveling of knots, each release narrowing options (spirits must be settled before dawn? implied). Agency is clear: her needlework drives escalation, and cost is felt (“lucid unrest” within her settles only after labor). However, the pressure remains textural rather than causal; while stakes are viscerally rendered, the tightening lacks a concrete trade-off (e.g., personal sacrifice beyond emotional toll). Still, under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the last knot’s undoing reweights peace as hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reopening the whispered chapel to interpret silenced stories—is signaled early and deepens when the map tear is revealed as a portal. Escalation occurs through the protagonist’s agency: she repositions the projector, overlays images, and traces emergent glyphs, each choice narrowing her focus and increasing emotional exposure. Cost is felt in her “shielded openness” and the weight of communal grief, though the pressure remains internal and textural rather than externalized conflict. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight arises from disciplined comparison.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the last transmission to understand “the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens via untangling filaments, which narrows options (only one path to activate the console). Agency is present: Mort’s deliberate handling triggers the whisper. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the realization that his own story will “dissolve into the deep”—and charges the final image. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—tightens meaningfully: initial solo ritual escalates when the ghost’s plea (“I need a voice beyond the circuits”) demands reciprocal vulnerability. The balladeer’s agency drives escalation; he chooses fresh tulips over wilted blooms, weaving hope into code. Cost is felt in his final strum—encoding his own longing—which binds him permanently to the ghost’s mural. Coincidence never resolves; thunder merely punctuates earned communion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering buried joy—is signaled early and deepens when the diary reveals the crystal jars. The servant’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, retrieve, and return. Cost is felt subtly: the ache of sorrow melting implies emotional labor, though a more tangible sacrifice (e.g., leaving part of himself behind) would heighten stakes. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with light density increasing alongside emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—memorializing loss through cloud-emotion taxonomy—is signaled early and deepens when Aria inscribes feelings onto the telescope, narrowing her method into ritual. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, but the cost is felt: isolation, the weight of remembrance, the irreversible break. The tightening occurs when she shifts from observation to inscription, foreclosing detachment. Coincidence (comet) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her recording.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing boundless sky before demolition—is signaled early and tightens via the noon deadline. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses specific pigments, follows the coin’s notches, presses it into wet plaster. Cost is felt in the hush before collapse and the knowledge that her work may vanish. However, external pressure (demolition crew) remains off-stage until the end, slightly muting opposition; the conflict is internalized beautifully but lacks a live, resisting force beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—charting stranded luminance as a navigational beacon—is signaled early and deepens when Lira must avoid draining the ship’s life-force. The meaningful tightening occurs when she plots the luminance’s path along copper veins, narrowing her method to chalk lines aligned with polyglot phrases. Cost is legible: the crew feels a “warm presence,” implying shared risk, and the ship’s engine syncs only after her precise intervention. Agency is fully hers; coincidence (starlings) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repairing broken time—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of prophecy scraps and the hall of mirrors. The tightening occurs when the locksmith must use the master key filament, risking failure. Agency drives escalation: his whispered prophecy line triggers gear assembly. Cost is visible in emotional weight (“heart heavy”) and implied loss of past selves (“fractured into countless versions”). However, the resolution leans slightly on mystical convenience (prophecy as deus ex machina), mildly undercutting earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming strangers into family through shared ritual—is signaled early and deepened by Liora’s call to “reexamine how they shared resources.” Pressure escalates via collective movement toward the bell, culminating in synchronized action. Though coincidence doesn’t resolve conflict, protagonist agency is diffuse: Liora initiates, but villagers enact. Cost is conceptual (past thirst) made tangible through vow, satisfying Accumulative lens escalation with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—pausing time’s final ripple—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s physical and emotional investment. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual (turning the dial, whispering), which forecloses the path of passive observation. The cost is felt: she endures scorched nerves and carries irrevocable weight. While escalation is subtle (as fits the Accumulative lens), the tightening occurs when the pane thickens into a veil—narrowing the window for action. No coincidence resolves conflict; all pressure stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers to safety before frost locks the nut’s warmth—is signaled early and escalates via environmental pressure (frost’s approach, birds’ circling). The caretaker’s agency lies in precise, fragile method (“tracing patterns in the wind”), and cost is felt in the orchard’s shudder and bitter aftertaste. One meaningful tightening occurs at the altar, where success is partial and temporary. Coincidence never resolves; everything stems from accumulated ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming separation into connection—is signaled early and tightens when Mara abandons lab protocols for river observation, foreclosing sterile methodology. Escalation is driven by her agency: insight → scaffold-building → solidification. Cost is visible in her initial grief and the risk of professional ridicule (“colleagues stared, puzzled”). Coincidence (gust scattering foam) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the cure emerges from her applied insight.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled early and deepens through the method of “quantifying absence.” Escalation occurs when each counted void brightens the moonlight, culminating in the incision that ignites dormant scripts. Cost is conceptual (the dissolution of quest into air) and visible (shelves reconfigured, floor inscribed). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming contagious remorse into seasoning—is signaled early and tightens when Lir tastes the bitterness, risking emotional contagion. His agency drives escalation: analyzing pools informs stirring motions that “push out the salt.” Cost is unmistakable—the pavilion cracks, walls ripple, and the chef absorbs sorrow. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from his deliberate acts under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating forgotten voices—is signaled early and deepens when interspersed languages trigger workers’ memories, raising emotional stakes. The librarian’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to drop the weight, weave tongues, direct bridge-building. Cost is felt in the labor of laying planks and the vulnerability of exposed memory. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sonic density (grumble → chorus), not causal turns, satisfying Track A’s single meaningful deepening requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Aria realizes she must not only record but *revive* them. The tremor introduces meaningful pressure, forcing her to “steady herself” and press on, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible: the bridge is fragile, the stone may fracture, and the work is precarious. Escalation is driven by Aria’s agency (calibrating, pressing palm, rewriting pathways), though the “unseen forces” shifting stones slightly dilute causal ownership. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten combinations—is signaled early and tightens during the inversion hour, when failure means losing access forever. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she aligns symbols using the doodle, triggering the cipher. Cost is felt—the manuscript fades, the hour ends—but could be sharper; the stakes remain intellectual rather than personal loss. Still, the narrowing window and bodily eligibility (tattoos flickering) create coherent pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and deepens as each stress crack yields “a tender melody of shared feeling,” narrowing Auris’s focus to decoding memory in fissures. Agency is sustained: he chooses reeds, angles, pressures; the cost is emotional labor and vulnerability (“translating pain”). Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of resonance builds until the grove exhales sound—but lacks a decisive tactical trade-off (e.g., risking the insulator’s breakage). The owls’ emergence feels earned by accumulated vibration, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing the eclipsed covenant by correlating celestial and human patterns—is signaled early and deepens through atmospheric intensification, fitting the Accumulative lens. Yet the “tightening” is tonal, not tactical: no live option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The tutor’s agency lies in interpretation, not decision with consequence. The phrase “before the next phase” implies urgency but exerts no measurable pressure on choices. Cost remains conceptual (exile, longing) without opportunity loss or irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering unheard stories through empathetic resonance—is signaled early and deepens via the tuning process. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he sets crystals, names silences, aligns frequencies. Cost is felt conceptually (the town’s collective breath) but lacks a personal, tangible loss—no tool broken, time forfeited, or relationship altered. Still, the deepening reweights silence from void to vessel, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity through the corpse flower—is signaled early and deepens via seasonal patience. But escalation lacks agency-driven pressure: the flower blooms because time passes, not due to Lira’s tactical shifts or sacrifices. The elders’ warning is static; no reversal tests her commitment. Cost is conceptual (time), but no visible forfeiture alters her tactics. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, yet the pressure remains ambient, not sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the true catalyst is cultural memory, not the artifact. The gravity-inversion timeframe forces urgency, narrowing options (only 60 minutes to act). Agency is clear: her choice to release the tip crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt (she forfeits the valuable tip) but could be sharper—what does she lose personally beyond mission parameters? Still, escalation aligns with the Accumulative lens via density of echo/water motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—dissipating storm energy before it reignites—is signaled early and tightens at the central tower, where still-air becomes a trigger point. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her mapping predicts paths, culminating in the whispered command that unleashes the vortex. Cost is felt in the “pent-up pressure” released and the burden she accepts. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her method earns the outcome under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“to certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early but never tested; no opposition, obstacle, or internal friction arises. The “tightening” is atmospheric (aurora intensifies, song spreads), not consequential. Agency is performative, not pressured: she sings because she can, not because she must choose amid cost. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation via sensory deepening suffices, but the absence of any foreclosed path or sacrifice limits the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redefining guardianship through failed cycles—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes old keepers “clung to one path.” Her agency drives escalation: uncase → arrange → play → enter → return. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of singular truth and the burden of carrying multiversal echoes. Though pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, the tightening lacks a visible trade-off beyond conceptual shift, slightly limiting peak score.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens as Mara maps feelings to intervals and equations. Agency is present: she chooses ambiguity, presses ink, transposes grief into code. Escalation occurs when the fragment begins echoing verses, forcing her to absorb and encode more intensely. Cost is conceptual (the fragment’s destruction) and tactical (she must now carry shards forward), though physical/emotional toll remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine—is signaled early and tightens through two escalating uses of the pendant, each deepening the courier’s impact (shepherd’s laugh → girl’s discovery of a hidden garden). Agency is consistent: he chooses whom to engage, and the pendant’s vibration requires active offering. Cost is conceptual but clear: his mentor remains absent, and his labor yields only fleeting sparks, yet he persists. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density of wonder-seeds, not narrowed options—but the final caravan testimony confirms lasting consequence, satisfying escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepens when the prism’s grief awakens the car, raising conceptual stakes from hypothesis to world-altering truth. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her chant, alignment, and communion trigger each intensification. The cost is felt—the burden of responsibility once the veil lifts—and forecloses innocence. Coincidence (the dormant car starting) is framed as resonance, not resolution, maintaining coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes she must leave part of herself behind. Agency lies in renunciation, not action; each puzzle placement narrows her path toward sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable: the bead dims, her bones ache with latent loss. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via sensory density (clicks → chords → hum), though the “raveling silence” as antagonist lacks tangible resistance beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bartering memory for future strength—is signaled early and tightens when the blacksmith sacrifices his first failure. Agency drives escalation: his deliberate descent, palm on glyph, and reach for silk narrow options meaningfully. Cost is legible (lost memory, soot-hidden scar), though the mine’s compliance borders on convenient. Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—revealing the commander’s secret—is signaled early and tightens when Lira accesses the alternate timeline where evacuation never occurred. The meaningful deepening occurs at the hidden log, which reweights the moral calculus: elite evacuation vs. mass stasis. Protagonist agency drives escalation (she commands the shard twice), and the cost is conceptual but undeniable—the truth’s release demands the shard’s destruction and irreversible reality-weaving. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from Lira’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional safety in darkness—is signaled early and deepens through Marek’s ritual. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each stone placement tightens the chain of hope, culminating in the lamp’s death and the spiral’s pulse. Cost is legible: the physical light fails, but Marek shoulders the burden of continuity (“vow to protect”). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing unformed storms by steering light inward—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s realization that symbols are “accidentally prophetic.” The tightening occurs when she urges, “We must act now, before the tide erases our chance,” forcing immediate ritual execution. Cost is visible: the old world ends with the newspaper’s dissolution, and ancient shadows awaken with irreversible consequence. Though the storm herald aids, escalation hinges on Mira’s agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why stories magnetize to certain people—is signaled early and tightens when Lira uses sun trails to read cloud-script, a method enabled only by the donor heart. The escalation is driven by her agency: placing the wing on the loom transforms passive observation into active guardianship. Cost is legible in the closure: she assumes a lifelong duty (“guard the iridescent caution”), though the emotional or physical toll remains implied rather than shown. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, but the price lacks visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—relieving the labyrinth of quantified sorrow—is signaled early and deepens as Eli maps dreams, each traced line dimming the grid. Escalation occurs through accumulation: filaments dissolve like sighs, culminating in the tower’s audible “inhale.” Agency is clear—Eli chooses gentle unspooling over force—and cost is felt in the irreversible release of centuries of grief. The storm’s softening externalizes internal shift, though the tightening lacks a single decisive narrowing of options, slightly limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a realm frozen in night—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s escalating song, which transforms soil, spirits, and sky. The tightening occurs when wandering spirits arrive, forcing Lira to expand her role from keeper to conduit, raising the emotional and metaphysical cost. Agency is clear: her choice to “let the forgotten songs cascade” directly triggers the sunrise. However, the escalation leans slightly on lyric accumulation over concrete trade-offs; the price feels poetic rather than viscerally felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—confronting a buried mistake—is signaled early and tightens when the recluse chooses to enter rather than hide. The meaningful deepening occurs at the mirror-book, where admission becomes the key, foreclosing denial as a path. Cost is legible: he must carry his grief openly, trading isolation for integrated compassion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the curator’s intervention borders on deus ex machina if not for the prior emphasis on “admitting error” as the true portal.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the ordinary from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the loaf is uncovered, transforming passive observation into ritual action. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to carry, place, slice, and share the bread, each act narrowing options toward Charged Poise. Cost is conceptual (absolution’s fragility) and felt (the warmth exists only in memory), though physical or social price remains abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices—but a sharper forfeiture (e.g., abandoning a duty to tend the garden) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—binding luminous vows to prevent oblivion—is signaled early and deepens as frequencies shift with the library’s “exhalation.” The chief’s agency drives escalation: her patience, measurement, and recording narrow options until the final pulse syncs with her heartbeat. Cost is felt (“weight of each vow”) and conceptual (personal pilgrimage vs. archival duty). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the sky’s dissolution complicates but the chief’s method overcomes it.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving the truce of hush—is signaled early and tightens when Lila thwarts the theft, momentarily breaking the truce but restoring it through testimony. Escalation is driven by her agency: decoy deployment, rope coil seizure, lantern hurling. Cost is felt (“comforting unease settled deeper”) and conceptual (peace is fragile, temporary). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; tactics stem from learned patterns (“false starts like tides”).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and deepens when Arin realizes he, too, embodies personal weather. The meaningful tightening occurs when collective tasting alters atmospheric chemistry, forcing Arin to confront emergent systems beyond individual perception. Cost is felt in his loss of scientific detachment, replaced by awe. Though pressure accumulates beautifully, the absence of a tangible trade-off (e.g., physical toll, social rupture) slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—rectifying suppressed creativity—is signaled early and tightens when the rusted locker appears as a symbol of Lena’s block. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she paints, conceals the mirror, aligns reflection, and triggers the lock’s opening. Cost is legible in the “auroral sorrow” that deepens into twilight—a felt emotional toll—and the irreversible release of the ink alters her future artistic capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth in a dishonest society—is signaled early and tightens when the council demands loyalty. Protagonist agency drives escalation: refusal → map retrieval → rereading → vent activation. Each turn narrows options (e.g., plate dulls irreversibly) and deepens knowledge (bottles vibrate only with candor). Cost is felt in environmental grief (fading glow over dry basins) and personal risk, culminating in a decisive act that forecloses passive endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the season of silence. The meaningful tightening occurs when the tuner shifts from spoken notes to kinetic translation, foreclosing verbal expression as a path forward. Agency is expressed through attention and maintenance, not dramatic action, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: communal muteness, reliance on fragile ice, the perpetual risk of fading. Though pressure remains atmospheric rather than confrontational, it coheres and intensifies toward the charged final stanza.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—containing internal and external chaos—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when magnetic north shifts, forcing Vira to act before the burn escapes. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to miniaturize, not flee or suppress. Cost is legible: the static dissolves only after she risks using the box, implying prior isolation from her own fears. Yet the “controlled burn escape” threat resolves too cleanly; the system logs success without showing near-failure or tangible loss, softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking communal healing through listening—is signaled early and deepens as names emerge from the melody. Pressure escalates texturally: commuters’ chatter clashes with courtyard quiet, raising the need for focus. Yet agency is passive; Mara listens, arranges, and receives, but doesn’t wrestle with resistance or make a costly choice. The tightening occurs off-page (letters “slip out” magically), and the boy’s request resets rather than deepens the conflict. Cost is implied (noise fading) but not dramatized as sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—encoding vulnerability as strength—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates texturally (tide rises, dice respond), yet no meaningful tightening forces a trade-off; Selene’s “calm defiance” faces no real opposition beyond atmospheric weight. The liberation of the crystal feels inevitable, not hard-won, and cost is implied (secrets released) but not dramatized as loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memories—is signaled early and deepens through the coffee-ground ritual and chamber entry. The meaningful tightening occurs when the spiral appears, triggering the floor’s tremor and luminance, which narrows options to one decisive act: exhume. Cost is felt in the whale’s silence and the village’s lingering grief, though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than causal pressure. Gravity pockets complicate but don’t resolve; agency remains Mara’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing celestial rupture—is signaled early and tightens through the summoner’s focused ritual. Agency is expressed via attention and endurance: she maps silence, aligns the wing, breathes intention. The escalation is textural, not causal, but under the Accumulative lens, the deepening of quiet into a “lattice of calm” reweights the stakes with felt cost (the world’s ignorance preserved). No false resolution; the threat is neutralized through sustained effort, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding stone’s language—is signaled early and deepens when Liora reframes it as hearing “heartbeats,” not cracking codes. The tightening occurs when the narrator abandons interrogation for weekly tea, trading control for vulnerability. Agency is clear: choosing borrowed sugar initiates the pact. Coincidence (meteor shower) complicates but doesn’t resolve; cost is felt in surrendered scholarly pretense. One meaningful deepening suffices, though escalation leans atmospheric over tactical under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (“translate isolation into independence”) is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—the shell whispers, she records, dawn comes. Agency is passive reception, not decision or renunciation. Cost is absent: the “quarantined memory” suffers no loss, and solitude transforms effortlessly into strength. Coincidence (dawn) resolves nothing because nothing was at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forgiving the unfinished through calibrated treason—is signaled early and deepens when Liora chooses healing over subversion. The tightening occurs when she traces hidden verses onto marble, risking exposure to fulfill her vow. Cost is visible: the key melts, the thorn’s purpose ends, and she accepts eternal responsibility (“I will forever unlink…”). Though pressure is internal, it coheres under the Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening that reweights her entire practice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—answering why people echo—is signaled early and intensifies through progressive disclosure, culminating in the lattice revelation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she sings truths to stones, places the shell on the altar, and unites the halves. Cost is legible in her enduring role as carrier of echoes, though physical or temporal sacrifice remains abstract. The “webs of intrigue” tighten pressure but resolve too neatly, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing hidden purity beneath wreckage—is signaled early and deepens via dream-lattice mapping. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she doesn’t passively receive visions but actively weaves truth and implants final cameos. Cost is conceptual (the labor of dream-tending) and felt in the “veil thickening” tension. However, the pressure tightens texturally rather than foreclosing concrete options; no live path is visibly sacrificed, slightly muting the stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The “conflict” is internal contemplation without opposition, escalation, or trade-off. Fireflies and moon paths complicate nothing; they merely mirror preexisting philosophy. No option is narrowed, no cost incurred—only affirmation accumulates. Under an Accumulative lens, this lacks the required deepening that reweights stakes with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. corporate lies—is signaled early and deepens when the “curse” is revealed as cover for the stillpoint. Pressure escalates via environmental hostility (dust storms) and cognitive labor (reassembling fragments), culminating in a meaningful tightening: only patience and reconstruction yield truth. Cost is felt in Mira’s solitude and burden of protection, though the stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral. Agency is clear—her intuition and method drive every turn—but the opposition (corporate ghost) exerts no active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—forging variant allegiance through ancient shadows—is signaled early and deepens via the drones’ harmonic test and the aurora climax. Pressure escalates texturally (density of radio fragments, mirror arrangements, coil hums), consistent with the Accumulative lens. Yet agency feels passive; the visionary reacts to Selene’s broadcasts rather than driving reversals. Cost is conceptual (lifelong loneliness) but lacks visceral, on-page forfeiture tied to specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—carrying ancestral music forward—is signaled early and deepens through the method of sound-capturing. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: each jar enriches the tapestry, culminating in the child’s arrival. The poet’s agency is limited to listening and offering; escalation relies on discovery, not choice under opposition. Cost is conceptual (loneliness lifting) but not viscerally paid—no tool lost, time spent, or belief shattered to alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting the Heart from weaponization—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must align her heartbeat to unlock the vault, narrowing options to precise vibrational control. Agency is active: she wires coils, measures frequency, strikes the drum. Cost is felt in her tear and implied exhaustion, though not materially dramatized (e.g., lost tool, injury). Escalation is driven by her adaptation under pressure, consistent with Accumulative lens, but the “storm-born seekers” remain abstract, weakening oppositional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—forging patience from impatience—is signaled early and deepens through the magnetic pulse’s tidal rhythm, which narrows Elara’s focus to precise lunar alignment. Her agency drives escalation: she places the compass, aligns with the surge, and whispers her mantra. The cost is legible in the “crack… of release,” symbolizing surrendered tension, and her chest expanding as fire cools to ember. However, the pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric; there’s no tangible trade-off or loss beyond abstract yearning, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing infrastructure neglect to prevent deaths—is clear early and tightens when Mara connects humidity to the lantern’s flicker, revealing a hidden conduit. This deepening escalates pressure by linking past (Underground Railroad) and present (bureaucratic failure). However, the escalation relies more on associative insight than protagonist-driven action; the “discovery” emerges from observation without meaningful risk or complication. The cost—breaking free from “controlling influence”—is thematic but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., evidence destroyed, access revoked).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether mechanical redemption can mirror human repentance—is signaled early and deepens when the shopkeeper insists on a “fresh spring,” not just winding. This tightening forces the chaplain to confront that forgiveness requires structural change, not sentiment. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his decision to assist, his slow insertion of the rod), and the cost—emotional labor, moral responsibility—is felt in the “vibrant hush.” Coincidence (sunlight) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the beat begins only after human action primes it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ringing the bell—is clear from the outset and deepens via the transliteration protocol, which converts chaos into vector. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara brushes the bell’s cradle, achieving her goal yet receiving no audible reward—only algorithmic satisfaction. Cost is conceptual but legible: she pursues meaning that cannot be shared, embracing solitude as price. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. The stakes remain viscerally felt through tactile interaction with impossible objects.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting lost voices—is signaled early and tightens when Lia’s fabricated post triggers network-wide dispersion of the code. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses deception, then leverages the system’s response. Cost is felt in her transformed purpose (“lifeline to those lost voices”), though the price remains conceptual rather than visceral. Coincidence (algorithm flagging) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real breakthrough comes from her checksum insight.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring wholeness to guide the lost—is signaled early and deepens through the mirrors’ visions, which raise emotional stakes (a trembling child, ice spirits’ debate). The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to align shards based on reflections, whispering intention that fuses resolve with empathy. Cost is felt conceptually (the burden of unspoken hopes) but lacks a concrete forfeiture; the tightening is thematic rather than tactical, slightly softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when volunteering shifts from passive observation to communal ritual (hands on buoy), forcing a reconfiguration of purpose. Agency lies in attention: choosing to hear surrender as lullaby. Cost is felt (abandoning euthanasia tourism) but not viscerally dramatized; escalation relies on textural accumulation over decisive turn. Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling mismatched love through terroir—is signaled early and deepens via the sentinel’s ritual planting of the letter. Pressure accumulates texturally: each parallel drawn between vine scars and burnt ink tightens the emotional resonance. But agency is passive; the world responds to his whispers without resistance, so escalation lacks cost. The “price” is conceptual (loneliness transformed into purpose), but no on-page forfeiture—time, tool, opportunity—alters tactics. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, yet conflict remains internal and consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving transient wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when the prophet arrives, tightening the Keeper’s role from observer to consecrator. Escalation is driven by his agency: he chooses peripheral awareness over direct intervention, narrowing options to quiet alignment. Cost is felt in the fleetingness of the clearing and the burden of carrying echoes alone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—no false resolutions, no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—collective healing—is signaled early but remains abstract; it’s declared, not tested. Pressure accumulates texturally (more photos, more villagers) but lacks a decisive tightening: no option is lost, no tactic fails. The feather’s reveal feels like grace, not earned consequence. Mara’s agency is passive (“linger,” “arranged,” “whispered”)—she curates, not contends. Cost is implied in “wounded spirits,” but no on-page sacrifice or irreversible choice crystallizes stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding language’s hidden growth pattern—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal reveals itself as the library’s memory. Escalation occurs through Mara’s active testimony, which pulls light into lattice, triggering the chorus. Cost is conceptual (the era of bound words is over) but not viscerally felt; no tangible forfeiture tightens tactics. Still, the deepening reweights her mission from academic to sacred, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of aging—is signaled early and tightens when the prophet chooses to record onto a buried cassette, accepting futility as meaningful. Pressure escalates texturally: each footfall stirs forgotten forecasts, each driftwood marker points to fading memories, culminating in the monolith encounter. The cost is conceptual (forgetting is inevitable) yet viscerally rendered in “memories slipping through the reeds of time.” Agency is maintained through attention and ritual, not reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before it dissolves—is signaled early and deepens when the sage must restructure the entire mechanism, aligning inertia with telescope momentum. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he listens, opens the cradle, waits for the leaf’s chime, then surrenders excess spin. Cost is felt in the “bittersweet glow” and “longing” that paint the clouds—emotional price of cosmic alignment. Though stakes remain abstract (“threshold where dreams escaped gravity”), they’re viscerally rendered through luminous ache and star-pulse synchronicity, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guiding Mr. Harlan’s transition with dignity—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s ritualized music. The tightening occurs when she places the vinyl shard, committing to a symbolic reunification that narrows her method to one fragile, imperfect act. Cost is felt emotionally (her whispered thanks, the staff’s reverence) but lacks concrete trade-offs (time, stamina, personal sacrifice). Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet agency remains passive endurance rather than decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking shadow pathways via sealed awakenings—is signaled early and tightens through Lira’s nightly ritual. Agency is clear: she chooses to relearn closing loops, traces the spiral, whispers the incantation. The escalation is textural but decisive: misaligned clocks → bent reality → dormant potentials → final glyph alignment. Cost is felt in the key winding down and the isle “settling,” implying irreversible expenditure. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from Lira’s persistent, methodical action.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring fractured truth—is signaled early and tightens when Mara confronts the hollow ribs, forcing her to use the tooth as vertebrae. Agency is clear: her bone-setting method drives the climax. Cost is legible in the “cleft in certainty” narrowing but not vanishing, and the garden’s urgency reflects raised stakes. However, escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—sharing non-flame light—is signaled early and deepens through polishing and arrangement. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, narrowing options via ritual precision. The tightening occurs when she completes the spiral, foreclosing her past self (“now anchored to earth”). Cost is conceptual (abandoning cosmic chase) but legible in the final breath-weight comparison. No external opposition, but internal stakes cohere under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming public pain into private healing—is signaled early and tightens when Lira proffers the pendant to awaken code. Agency is quiet but decisive: her acts of care foreclose passive grief, trading isolation for stewardship. Cost is felt (“protected vulnerability”) and visible (the garden absorbs her sigh as new growth). Escalation follows the Accumulative lens—density increases via stones, scent, light—but lacks a second meaningful pressure point beyond the initial choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—collecting fragile hopes against narrative current—is signaled early and deepens through cameo encounters. The protagonist’s agency is clear: she moves against the flow, records fleeting moments, and binds them solemnly. Yet escalation lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows options; each cameo arrives similarly, without compounding risk or altered tactics. The cost is conceptual (binding hopes may be theft), but no visible price—lost time, stamina, or opportunity—alters her method. Under an Accumulative lens, this density suffices, but not enough for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the remedy is “reenactment of memory,” not tinkering. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her lyre-playing coaxes the vine, which responds only when aligned with the moon’s ascent. Cost is felt in the pollen-vow settling on her shoulders—a literal weight of covenant. Pressure tightens once meaningfully, satisfying short-form scope, though the absence of tangible opposition softens the stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating ephemeral feeling into enduring light—is signaled early and tightens when she risks the seal’s fragility (“hold only as long as she continued to tend”). The escalation is protagonist-driven: her whisper triggers the flare, her arrangement invites the binding. Cost is felt: eternal vigilance replaces completion. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though a second tactical trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a personal memento) could have intensified pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—harvesting echoes before they fade—is signaled early and tightens as Corin realizes the missing tooth must be resonant crystal, not metal. His agency drives escalation: he chooses quartz, polishes it, inserts it. Cost is conceptual but felt: the “wounded season” is fleeting, and his success depends on precise alignment of light and time. The stakes deepen when he recognizes the cellar as library, not prison—a reconfiguration earned through his labor. No external antagonist needed; pressure arises from temporal fragility and technical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unbinding trapped sorrow—is signaled early and deepens through the calcification process, which narrows options by requiring absolute stillness. The weaver’s agency drives escalation: each alignment attempt risks failure if air stirs. Cost is legible in the “forgotten promise” dissolving into flame, though physical or temporal price remains abstract. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with cadence shifting from hush to chime to lullaby, reweighting emotional mass without external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into utility—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification: sealing raw sap into amber becomes the physical manifestation of containing loss. Agency is clear in Mara’s hands-on process, and the cost (silencing the roar into a sigh) is felt in the final glow. However, pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric; external or relational opposition is absent, limiting escalation under a purely Situational lens, though acceptable under Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—negotiating regret for lost wonder—is signaled early and deepens through fragment collection, which visibly weighs down the ghost. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara offers her stories in exchange, narrowing her path from passive collector to active bargainer. Cost is felt: her tears, the abandoned ambitions, the ghost’s fading. However, escalation leans slightly on atmospheric accumulation over tactical shifts—Mara’s methods don’t adapt under pressure, merely persist—keeping this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting hope through redirected flows—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes equations must address sentiment, not just power. Agency is maintained throughout; her calculations drive escalation. However, the cost is largely conceptual (lost carnival joy) rather than visceral or personal; no tangible sacrifice or irreversible loss tightens pressure. The stakes feel intellectualized, not viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with an abandoned artistic dream—is signaled early and deepens through tactile engagement rather than external opposition. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he chooses to inscribe, to listen, to whisper gratitude. The “glacial hush” isn’t passive; it intensifies pressure by magnifying internal noise. Cost is felt in the weight of years lost, now transmuted into patient creation. One tightening suffices: the shift from dismissal (“too sentimental”) to tender inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—salvaging truth from fabricated narratives—is signaled early and deepens when the lock’s repair becomes both literal and metaphorical. The seeker’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to act, guided by instinct and tool, which unravels the “architecture of lies.” Cost is conceptual but legible: the crumbling of generational falsehoods implies loss of comforting illusions. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from static hum to morning silence intensifies pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving weavers’ knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the rope reveals the master weaver’s spiral, raising urgency. Escalation occurs through the collector’s active coaxing of meaning, culminating in the fulgurite’s activation. Cost is felt as the burden of centuries and deferred sharing (sealed glass), though no tangible loss (time, tool, relationship) alters tactics. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with fog and snow tightening the window for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unmarked absences—is signaled early and deepens when the thread revives the rose, transforming documentation into active healing. This escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his decision to “project his presence” tightens the narrative by narrowing possibility to what the thread can reveal. Cost is felt in his enduring solitude and the weight of unfinished work, crystallized in the final image where “each corridor required a new thread.” No coincidence resolves tension; pressure coheres entirely through his method.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—tightens when the prince chooses fragile hope over inherited conquest, foreclosing his old identity. Escalation is driven by his agency: hypothesizing, assembling, placing the cradle beneath the weeping stalactite. Cost is felt in the phoenix’s lament and the irreversible synchronization of palace and bird—a permanent fusion that erases the old mechanical purity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited fire into healing—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s ritual act. The graft forecloses the path of shame, replacing it with communal peace, paid for by her vulnerability before judgmental villagers. Pressure escalates texturally: clouds migrate, light shifts, the coin sings—all narrowing the emotional aperture toward Charged Poise. Cost is visible: her scarred hands, the weight of lineage, the risk of rejection—all crystallize in the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s growing attunement to the city’s hush. Escalation occurs via the box’s resistance (“hinges tightening,” glass “stick[ing]”) and the precise timing required (“pause of migrating geese”), which narrows her window for action. The cost is conceptual but legible: she trades certainty for faith, skepticism for stewardship. Though luck (geese pausing) enables resolution, it’s framed as a cyclical, earned alignment—not coincidence—under the Accumulative lens. Agency lies in her patience, not force.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and deepens when sonar reveals “shadows of forgotten wars,” raising emotional cost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she actively releases pulses, listens to echoes, and buries the gear. Pressure tightens as the gear spins faster, feeding an “ever-widening chorus,” culminating in a decisive act (letting the gear seed the soil). The cost—confronting fire’s legacy while offering fragile hope—is unmistakable in the final luminous mist.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and deepens through the butterfly migration’s three-month arc. Eliam’s agency lies in observation and arrangement, but escalation leans passive; Mara’s guidance supplants struggle. Cost is conceptual (emotional labor of mapping sorrow) but not viscerally felt in choice. The spiral’s growth and ribbon’s unwinding provide accumulative pressure, yet no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through incremental absolution—is signaled early and tightens via the pendulum’s pause, which forces Mara’s ritual. The deepening occurs when the bob trembles and the ridge exhales: stakes shift from mechanical repair to cosmic realignment. Cost is felt (“weight of centuries lift”) and visible (glowing carvings fused to metal). Agency is clear—Mara chooses alignment, whispers promise—and pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation leans textual over causal.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering true intentions—is signaled early and deepens when the tapestry reveals Marlowe’s secret map. The gardener’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, retrieves, and reinterprets. Cost is conceptual (historical injustice corrected) and felt in the “pressure of centuries,” though no material sacrifice occurs. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the chess clock merely times the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—averting famine through predictive modeling—is signaled early and tightens when the model forecasts specific threats (three-month thaw delay, silverfish). The cartographer’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just receive data but designs interventions (barley rows echoing his lattice, aurora mirrors). Cost is felt: the kingdom risks resources on unproven tech, and scholars’ initial skepticism implies reputational peril. Luck complicates (aurora surge) but doesn’t resolve; success stems from preparedness meeting opportunity under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving storytelling after famine—is signaled early and tightens when the pirate broadcast arrives, forcing Mara to act as conduit. Her agency drives escalation: she cloaks herself, transcribes, aligns the dial, and plays the song. The cost is conceptual but legible: silence is broken not by spectacle but by fragile, luminous labor that risks obscurity. However, the broadcast’s arrival leans slightly on coincidence (wind-shifted static forming rhythm), mildly undercutting causal pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing a fleeting emotion before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens when the chair slows, forcing the decisive act. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she reads markings, weaves truth, aligns mask and powder. The cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure (“true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling”) and irreversible transformation of the gallery. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textural density, not causal turns, which is appropriate and well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to remember water management methods—is signaled early and deepens when the cog reveals narrative convergence. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: his method of sifting silt leads to insight, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable—he relinquishes the purity of single-truth historiography for pluralistic preservation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through textual density, not causal turns, satisfying the brief-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through communal harmony—is signaled early and tightens when the teacher chooses to “subtract noise,” forcing vulnerability over spectacle. The escalation is driven by her agency: inviting broken voices deepens the conflict beyond performance into shared healing. Cost is felt in the “iron chains” of hatred dissolving—not erased, but rusted away—implying fragility. However, external opposition is abstract (“world outside losing songs”), reducing tangible pressure; the real conflict is internal/communal, which fits the lens but slightly softens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins through memory-pruning—is signaled early and deepens via the celestial alignment, which tightens the window for action and raises conceptual stakes. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses when to whisper, when to add the seed, when to promise renewal. Cost is felt in the shed tendrils and implied cultural loss, though the physical/emotional price to Mara remains abstract. The “gentle rebellion” forecloses ideological stagnation, satisfying lens-coherent pressure under Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—is signaled early and deepens when Mara confesses her hope for the drone’s return, risking disappointment. The tightening occurs when she speaks the riddle aloud, an act compelled by her truthfulness that triggers the box’s mechanism. Cost is legible: the city endured months of “buzzing silence,” and Mara’s vigil carried the weight of that absence. The drone’s pulse doesn’t restore the past but reweights it, making the echo a live, shared experience—a trade-off between chorus and singular resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming observation into sanctification—is signaled early and deepens when the shard’s hush radiates through displaced objects, narrowing the narrator’s role from witness to conduit. Agency drives escalation: purchasing, placing, and walking house-to-house are active choices that compound the hush’s reach. Cost is felt conceptually—the weight of unintended thoughts, the responsibility of catalysis—but lacks physical or social consequence. Coincidence (gulls pausing) complicates without resolving, maintaining pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—softening certainty with nuance—is signaled early and deepens through the statue’s deliberate use of the structural weakness to force architectural revelation. Agency is clear: the statue *threads* memory, *urges* kelp, *guides* bioluminescence. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the garden surrenders monolithic myth for pluralistic truth, visible in transformed statues and mosaics. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—one filament triggers cascades—but lacks a single high-pressure trade-off that narrows physical options, slightly limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and deepens into honoring its persistence, with visible cost: years of labor, acceptance of permanent flaw. Escalation occurs through Aric’s agency: building the contraption, programming step inclines, incorporating failure into proofs. The “rupture” is not luck but earned through his “balancedly daring” method. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern break (dice finally land scar-up) and cadence shift (staircase “sings”), reweighting the stake with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving lost languages to prove strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s nightly ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when Jiro arrives, embodying the very reciprocity she seeks to evoke; his memory of past kindness validates her labor. Cost is visible: her fatigue, the ephemeral notes left to chance, the smog’s persistent weight. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens, driven by Mara’s unwavering attention rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural identity through endangered arts—is signaled early and tightens when Liora initiates the bread ritual, foreclosing passive mourning. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her baking coaxes murals, which unlocks the amphitheater, enabling artisans’ return. Cost is felt in the “sweet and dangerous” dread and the ghostly beekeeper’s lingering sorrow. While pressure accumulates beautifully, the absence of a tangible setback or resistance (e.g., an artisan refusing to participate) slightly softens the stakes’ edge.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mastering the impossible mechanism to transcend fate—is signaled early and tightens when the yoyo reveals its cipher function. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he deciphers, assembles, initiates. Cost is legible: the hunger stone’s radiance depletes, and his solitude underscores sacrifice. However, external pressure is minimal; the sea roars but doesn’t actively oppose, slightly muting conflict depth required for 9+ under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—unbosoming fear to save her brother—is signaled early and tightens through paradoxical action. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she swallows the clasp, places it, whispers “vanish.” Cost is unmistakable: she’ll carry the luminance forever. The advisor complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s final act is hers alone, crystallizing her stance with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming hindrance into harmony—is signaled early and deepens through cloud-driven rhythmic escalation. The prophet’s agency drives each intensification; coincidence never resolves. A meaningful tightening occurs when the amber ribbon demands “deeper dub,” narrowing his options to a single syncopated strike. Cost is felt conceptually (the dissolution of clouds into silence) though not viscerally—no physical or relational loss anchors the thematic price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing fossilization through listening—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s decoding of fracture-as-language. The meaningful tightening occurs when the mosaic’s glow reveals the hidden passage, forcing her onto the turtle’s flank to confront watchers. Cost is felt in the dissolution of “dread” into resolve, though the external pressure from the silent watchers remains abstract rather than actively obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—is signaled early and deepens when Arlen realizes the shield has become a cage. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just find the letter; he interprets it, places it on a pedestal, and declares its purpose. The cost is conceptual (dismantling gilded narrative without shattering hope) and felt in the ivy’s retreat and warming air. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the absence of tangible sacrifice (time, tool, safety) slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (“catalogue ghosts of abandoned structures”) is signaled early but never truly pressured—no obstacle impedes Mara’s ritual, no consequence arises from her actions. The river’s mist and rising bridge create mood, not conflict. Escalation is textural (deepening description), not causal; no tightening forecloses options. Cost is implied (emotional labor) but not dramatized as a sacrifice that alters future capacity or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and deepens when Mara formulates her sacrificial flood hypothesis. The meaningful turn occurs when she cross-references sea charts with poetry, risking error for insight. Yet pressure remains intellectual, not visceral; no tangible loss (time, tool, safety) alters tactics. The council’s compliance removes opposition, flattening escalation. Cost is conceptual (truth vs. myth) but not felt in bodily or social terms on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into luminous memory—is signaled early and tightens at noon’s shadow detachment, the only window for recording. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he lifts the lantern, slides the sapphire, folds cranes—all choices that narrow options (e.g., once polished, dreams cannot be unrefined). Cost is felt: “luminous torment fills the air,” each glow “burns with the memory of loss.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the tightening lacks a second consequential trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding unused potential—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical quest. Pressure escalates through the protagonist’s agency: he calibrates, adjusts, steps forward, and thrusts his palm, each act narrowing options toward merger. The cost is felt as emotional transformation—loss melting into clarity—but remains largely internal; no tangible forfeiture (tool, time, physical safety) alters tactics. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the fissure (“quiet tide that lifted his consciousness”) reweights the stake with sufficient intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and deepens via collaborative discovery, but pressure remains abstract. The “missing pieces” never manifest as tangible obstacles; success arrives via ritual compliance, not earned reversal. Cost is conceptual (“collaborative pulse”) but lacks visceral price—no stamina lost, tool broken, or path abandoned. Escalation occurs texturally (air thickens, hum rises), fitting an Accumulative lens, yet agency feels passive.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—confronting manufactured lies—is signaled early and tightens when the carvings reveal the phrase about withheld truth, forcing a stance crystallization. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (sifting, aligning, placing the watch hand), not coincidence. Cost is felt in the abandonment of profitable deception, though the “gold” incentive fades without tangible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—peace through prisoner exchange—is signaled early, but pressure remains static; no real opposition tests it. The “untethering” is symbolic, not tactical; stakes feel declared rather than viscerally contested. Moon-phase synchronization is noted but never constrains action under duress. Cost is conceptual (past regret) but not dramatized as present sacrifice—no tool lost, time forfeited, or trust risked in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—overcoming the “backlash of regrets”—is signaled early and deepens texturally, but never tightens causally. The protagonist’s agency lies in endurance and reinterpretation, not in a choice that forecloses an option with tangible cost. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (“tidal wave of what‑ifs”) but doesn’t escalate via protagonist-driven turns. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices for resonance, but the absence of a live trade-off or forfeiture caps escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—earning empathy in a feelingless world—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror reveals a tearful self, forcing a trade-off between clinging to time-travel fantasy (the baseball) and embracing present responsibility. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing the left tunnel, gazing into the mirror, tossing the ball—all narrow options with felt cost. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; each clue tightens thematic focus. Coincidence never resolves conflict; even the child’s laugh is framed as echo, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s dread of metamorphosis. The tightening occurs when she mixes the paste: “reluctant shift that whispered that her bones might become bark.” Agency is clear; she chooses despite fear. Cost is felt (bark patterns on skin) and alters her existence permanently. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—ritual mechanics are earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost time to soothe unborn sighs—is signaled early and deepens when the crack widens into a vapor staircase. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her whispered names pull at the fissure, her unfastening releases grief, and her ascent reweights repentance as “cloudbound forgiveness.” Cost is legible in her relinquished grief and the vanished glade, though the pressure remains internalized rather than externally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the dimension through compassion, not force—is signaled early and deepens when joy becomes tactical (gravitational lightness enables stitching). Pressure escalates texturally: each stitch confronts hidden sorrow, and the cold weight on Nara’s back grows until her grin loosens gravity. The cost is felt—ancestral ghosts fade, the ship empties—but the escalation relies more on accumulation than protagonist-driven agency; the tear’s mechanics do most of the work. Still, the final choice crystallizes her creed with undeniable poise.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and deepens when fireflies escape, shifting from capture to witnessing. But escalation relies on atmospheric intensification, not protagonist-driven agency; Mara sets down the jar passively, and the “detour” resolves via external signs (fisherman, cracked star). Cost is conceptual (loss of control) but not viscerally felt; no tangible forfeiture alters her future tactics beyond vague “uncanny timing.”

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—igniting minds without violence—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s coded markings and mirror arrangements. The tightening occurs when the amber sundial line reveals the basement path, narrowing possibility to one decisive act. Cost is legible in the garrison’s irreversible shift (“question orders,” “secret smiles”), though Kael himself pays no personal price, softening the escalation’s bite. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but protagonist agency doesn’t narrow his own options—luck (sunrise timing) resolves access.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—harnessing star dust to rewrite the future—is clear early and deepens when the curse becomes a tool. Pressure escalates through Selene’s fear of futile foresight versus her resolve to act, culminating in the red stone placement. Cost is felt (“mantle upon her shoulders”) and the tide’s pause signals cosmic stakes. Yet escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than protagonist-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making suppressed truth breathable—is signaled early and deepens via the 23-minute timer, which imposes a live constraint. The poet’s agency is subtle but present: choosing when to place the envelope, whispering the uncensored line, descending with transformed understanding. Cost is conceptual (years of censorship) and felt (the weight of remembered wounds), though the lack of external opposition limits escalation. Still, the internal pressure tightens credibly toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—turning questions into destinations—is signaled early and deepens via the needle card’s transformation into a waypoint map. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally; each clash “mirrors the brook’s babble,” but no live option is foreclosed until the philosopher’s golden-arm signal. Cost is conceptual (chaos calmed, overture resolved), yet agency feels choreographed rather than chosen under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and deepens as shelves become altars. Agency emerges through rebuilding, not violence, with visible cost: Lira’s identity erosion and the prison’s confines. Escalation is accumulative, not causal; the coffee tin’s seeds intensify stakes by making hope literal. Coincidence (the guard’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their labor earns the bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defying fate through improvisation—is signaled early and tightens as night approaches. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he actively splices reels, climbs cloud-stairs, steps through frames. The cost is felt in the dissolution of his refuge and the irreversible silence of the clock. However, escalation leans heavily on lyrical accumulation rather than concrete narrowing of options; the “hidden sections” of the reel resolve too conveniently without prior tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—awakening the seed before monsoon—is signaled early and tightens as twilight deepens and clouds gather. Mara’s agency drives escalation: each translation intensifies lantern light and advances germination. The cost is felt in her “luminous doubt,” a fear that rain will drown the shoot before it sees sun. Though pressure is coherent, the monsoon remains atmospheric rather than an active antagonist, slightly muting tactical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—diffusing sorrow through aligning the compass with the hue of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens via the tutor’s ritual actions. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each knot tightens emotional resonance, culminating in the compass glowing cerulean. Agency is present in his recitation and placement, though conflict remains internalized; cost is felt in the island’s loosened sorrow, yet no tangible sacrifice or trade-off sharpens the climax.
