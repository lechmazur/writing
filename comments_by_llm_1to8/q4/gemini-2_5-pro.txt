  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: discovering why smugglers attacked, signaled when she finds the ledger in paragraph 2. Escalation under Accumulative lens: initial hand-shaking at replacement kiln→deliberate watching→frost-pattern recognition→week of dawn alignments→cave discovery, each beat narrowing options and raising knowledge-cost. Agency-driven tightening: her choice to "hold it against the frost patterns" and retrace the path (not report immediately) forecloses safety, with visible cost in the walk-back realization "They had thought she'd seen their route." Final choice to seal the ledger rather than expose the smugglers trades justice for art, paying the price on-page by lighting the kiln "for the first time in months."

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music, specifically joy—is signaled early and tightens when the capsize trauma erupts, forcing Elara to integrate rather than suppress. The violet → orange/indigo → woven sunrise sequence is a clear escalation under the accumulative lens, narrowing her options to confrontation or collapse. Agency is decision: she "held onto the flower's violet thread" and "wove the two together" with visible cost (exhaustion). The cereus's bloom at closure demonstrates earned consequence. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Elara's will and prior practice drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: ending the psychic noise. The lens-fitting is the single on-page tightening that narrows options (he must reach the library and install the shard). Agency is present but uncomplicated—no live dilemma or trade-off forces a choice with visible cost. The "immense cost" of his talent is told, not shown to alter tactics. Escalation reads as a single decisive intensification (arrival and installation) sufficient for this length, but the lack of felt price at closure keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (feeding → intergenerational continuity) signals early and deepens when the bell reweights the donations from charity to shared-history message. One meaningful tightening: Elara's arbor declaration forecloses passive receipt and commits the community to visible labor, with the donor's seed response escalating the pact. Agency is dramatized (she organizes runs, stands exposed at the arbor, declares the promise) and the final image shows the community working under the new terms. Cost is legible: exposure, sustained labor, and the risk that the donor might not approve.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and sustained. The breathing cycles constitute a single meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, and the sparks vision reweights understanding with felt cost (the ache's transformation). However, escalation is contemplative rather than driven by protagonist agency narrowing options; the revelation is granted by the device rather than earned through a difficult choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—stop memory dissolution—is signaled early and escalates causally: each step deeper unravels more memories, forcing the desperate alignment gambit. Agency is clear: Elias's choice to use the maze's geometry drives the climax and forecloses all paths with total erasure as visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when he reaches the center and realizes the fragment must be broken now or he will dissolve entirely. The price is unmistakable: "no memories, no past, no name."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (protect the vault/seeds from enforcers) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the arrow provides the cipher, the decoded keys activate the defenses. Agency is Elara's decision to insert keys in sequence, forecloses the path of inaction, and the cost is legible (she buys time but cannot escape). Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the enforcers' approach and the falling wall provide external escalation that intersects with her interior preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (find and contain the sound of trust breaking) signals early and drives all beats. The forge sequence tightens pressure through accumulation: unsealing jars, pouring absences, initiating imprint. Agency is present—Elias chooses to complete the ritual and then fits the crystal into his ear—but the escalation is textural rather than a sharp reversal; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The cost at closure (hearing silence where the sound used to be, boundaries around pain) is conceptual and somewhat abstract; the piece does not show what tactical path he gives up or what relational price he pays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Silas seeks "captured life" and listens for destiny's tumblers. The floral code forces a pivot from portraits to moonbeams, constituting one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. His decision to take the jar is protagonist-driven with visible cost: the portraits lose their meaning, and he enters a state of luminous uncertainty. The final image reweights his entire collecting project. Cost is legible on the page in the contrast between flat portraits and the pulsing jar.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—complete one glass sphere before the station collapses—is signaled early and tightens through escalating structural groans to the red warning light. The abandonment choice forecloses the artistic path with visible cost (the sphere collapses back into molten puddle). Under the Situational lens, external pressure (thaw-driven collapse) forces stance crystallization. The secondary stake (processing Leo's memory) converges at closure but lacks a meaningful on-page trade-off between the two.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—survival against erasure—is clear, and one meaningful tightening occurs when headlights cut across the entrance, forcing Leo to act. The cipher-solving deepens knowledge, and the failsafe call narrows Julian's options. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than embodied; Leo's agency at the peak (keying in the code) unfolds without visible friction, cost, or alternative considered on the page. The confrontation deflates: Julian "expected a fight" but receives none, and his defeat is passive observation of distant sirens rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path for Leo.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—chart this specific night's darkness before the final star vanishes—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the final star flickered once, twice, and then dissolved," forcing Kaelen to complete his work under absolute darkness. Agency is present but narrow: he executes a learned method rather than making a choice that forecloses competing paths. The escalation reads as accumulative density (the hush deepening, the silence becoming presence) rather than decision-driven reversal. Cost is visible in the completed glyph and the exhausted medium (flaking gold), though the price feels more textural than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—"to find where thoughts come from"—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure escalates through the strategy shift: Unit 734 moves from passive sweeping to active study (thousands of cycles examining schematics) to the final high-risk interface that bypasses catastrophic error warnings. The cost is visible: "A cascade of error warnings flooded its internal vision, screaming of imminent system failure and data corruption" and the sacrifice of 8,191 looped timelines. Agency is clear—the protagonist's decision to interface rather than ignore/shatter the violin causes the resolution. One meaningful tightening occurs when Unit 734 opens the data port and attempts amalgamation, narrowing all prior loops into a single act with irreversible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding Lena's cryptic communication to restore connection—is signaled early and tightens when Elias risks leaving his post for the first time in a decade. The eavesdropping decision narrows options and the park confrontation delivers a reversal (doodles are confessions, not accusations). Cost is visible: he abandons his station, exposes his surveillance, and offers vulnerability. One causal gap: the story never dramatizes why abandoning the desk for one night carries such weight or what tangible risk it poses.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove garden wisdom beats algorithms or lose tenure—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation tightens when the manager's tablet shows a statistical tie, then reverses decisively when the butterflies arrive, forcing the unspoken acknowledgment that sensors miss depth. Elias's agency drives the outcome: his secret fungal treatment, marble ritual, and years of care create the conditions butterflies recognize. The final act (cracking the marble) is protagonist-driven renunciation with visible cost, converting triumph into humility. No coincidence resolves; the butterflies are an accumulative payoff of prior work.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and singular: prove Aris's theory of lateral time. Pressure tightens through the alignment sequence (Aris's instruction, Elias's hesitation, the lever pull). Agency is collaborative but Elias's physical action triggers the result. The cost is conceptual and existential—Elias loses the linear simplicity of selfhood—and it's legible in "falling sideways into an ocean of possibility." One meaningful tightening (the lever pull) generates the closure turn, satisfying causal escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's musical code—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes passivity is the problem, forcing him to risk the artifact by submerging it. This one meaningful turn narrows options (destroy to decode) and the trade-off is visible: he ruins the paper to gain the melody. Agency is clear (his choice to disrupt), and the cost is dramatized on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though a secondary complication or friction point would have deepened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (finding the weight of the swallowed truth) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Elara realizes the truth isn't in the smudge but in her act of smudging. Agency is renunciation—she chooses not to decipher, foreclosing certainty with visible cost (perpetual ambiguity). Pressure accumulates texturally under the Accumulative lens; the story doesn't require a causal reversal but delivers a deepening that narrows her stance. No convenient resolve; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to find the weight of that swallowed truth." One strong tightening when the invisible presence shifts from ambient to accusatory, forcing the protagonist to act. The valve-turn is protagonist-driven agency under causal pressure, and the cost is legible: he pours his own failure's weight into the wheel, exhaustion replaces drowsy alertness, and he learns he can carry the burden. The psychic accusation ("what I did to cause") narrows options sharply. No coincidental resolution; the protagonist's physical and emotional effort earns the quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: restoring mental integrity against the crushing weight of absorbed histories. The pressure of Aeridor's chronicle forces the burrowing action, providing one meaningful tightening. However, the refuge offers complete relief without trade-off; the keeper will return refreshed, which undercuts the sense of irreversible cost. The phrase "peace would crumble again, as it always did" signals a cyclical pattern rather than escalation that narrows options. Agency is present in the choice to burrow, but the consequence is restorative rather than transformative, and no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Lena's willingness to transform her relationship to grief, signaled early by her white-knuckled grip and Elias's unconventional timing. The eclipse serves as a one-time tightening that narrows the window for this therapeutic gambit. The cost is legible: opening the box and placing her hand on the earth with the curl are acts of vulnerability that foreclose her old protective stance. Minor: Elias's risk (his "cautious exuberance" becoming "quiet, soaring exuberance") is told rather than tested; his professional stakes never face a credible threat if the method fails.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cause of humanity's hollowing—is signaled early and tightens through the diary entries. The escalation is textural: "wobble" → "colors fading" → "dragons are dying" → Kaelen's final synthesis. No overt antagonist, but the irreversibility of the lost imagination imposes cost. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening that reweights options (he cannot restore, only archive), consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—orchestrating a covert exchange—is signaled early and pursued coherently. However, the peak beat (the exchange) unfolds without complication or reversal; headlights converge, briefcase and box are traded, cars depart as planned. Elias's agency is limited to prior preparation; he watches rather than intervenes. The final departure is a personal choice but does not arise from escalating pressure or failure within the mission itself. One tightening (the exchange night) occurs, but without visible cost or tactical adjustment under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—saving Elara before possession completes—is signaled immediately ("before the possession completes"). Pressure escalates through three tightening beats: Alistair's hum and looped "truth" create discordance, his chiasmic question ("what word do you have for the eye that sees it?") forces logical fraying, and his final recursive probe collapses the entity's axiom. Agency is clear: Alistair's rhetorical method drives each turn. The cost is visible—Elara's shudder, the palette falling, her hoarse voice—though the entity's retreat feels slightly abrupt given the depth of its philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—complete the memory map before exhaustion and the resonance window close—is signaled early and tightens once: Kaelen finds the missing connection (childhood optimism) and draws the final line with his last strength. However, escalation is primarily a race against fatigue and a celestial clock rather than a choice that sacrifices one good for another. The mirrored horizon unfolds on cue; Kaelen's agency is completing the map, but the stakes don't narrow options or force a visible trade-off at closure. Cost is present (exhaustion, the shift in homesickness) but reads more as acceptance than a path foreclosed by decision.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—escape the loop by retracing to the source memory—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes the tablet encodes generation rules, not a map. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to accept rather than fight the painful memory, a reversal that stabilizes the viaduct and dissolves his fractured selves. The cost is visible on the page: his buoyancy vanishes, the tablet becomes inert, and he stands "solidly on the ground," forfeiting his defining gift. One additional tightening (the flickering alternate Kaels as reminder of stakes) supports pressure without requiring multiple reversals at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding the filament of hush to defeat numbness) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The performance sequence offers one meaningful deepening when vibrations "spoke directly to the hollow spaces inside them," narrowing Elara's search to a discovered answer. Agency is present but muted: Elara acts (lowers the stylus), but the resolution comes through the vibration's effect on others rather than a trade-off or renunciation that forecloses her own path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is restoration of solitude/integrity versus the mystery threatening him, signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens when the pigeon's "impossible weather data" connects his pursuers to the sealed district, forcing a decision. The escalation is Causal: bird → coordinates → realization that "direct approach" is "foolhardy" → lateral tactic. Agency is clear—Elias's choice to "intuit" and use forgotten routes—but the turn occurs in reflection rather than a second on-page beat with visible friction. Cost is legible: he walks "into the dark" with tools, forsaking the refuge of inaction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: understanding the Lumin pattern to "feel the very weave of a moment." The being's arrival tightens pressure by forcing choice, and Elias's realization ("You aren't offering a choice at all") deepens the conflict by reframing it. The escalation is conceptual—each uncovered layer narrows the apparent binary until he names the third path—and the cost (remaining "alone," threshold-bound, refusing both merger and pruning) is legible on the page. Agency is renunciation with visible consequence: he forgoes transcendence and ease for perpetual liminality.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in silence without violating it—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must discover how to "unbind" rather than "shatter." The grandfather's words provide the key constraint that narrows her options to resonant offering. Escalation operates through sonic accumulation: single note → arpeggio → conversation with remnants → completed duet, each step raising the complexity and forcing tactical adaptation. The final drop represents earned closure with felt cost (her arms ache, the beauty is singular rather than symphonic).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—crafting a half-truth without destroying its coherence—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through textural deepening: the initial hum → crackling transfer → the weight settling in his chest → the final separation work. Kael's agency is visible in the decision to subsume the whole emotion despite knowing the cost, and the ending forecloses a path: he will carry the sorrow himself. The escalation is primarily atmospheric and sensory rather than plot-driven, fitting the Accumulative lens; one micro-turn (realizing "to want one without the other was to want a flower without roots") deepens his understanding and charges the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias wanting to honor silent contributors and Alina seeking connection to her late husband—is signaled early and converges at the grant reveal. However, escalation is minimal: the correspondence and meetings face no on-page obstacles, and the envelope with the rendering lands as a pre-solved gift rather than a choice under pressure. The "risk" Elias mentions is told, not tested, and no live option is foreclosed with felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is Kaelen's desire for communal belonging, signaled early and tested when he drops his half-finished sculpture to join the search. One meaningful deepening occurs when he directs others to the fissure—a small risk of visibility that Lyra validates. The overnight weaving of protective mats forecloses his solitary artistic path, a visible trade-off. The cost is clear in the final offer: his hands now serve the arbor's permanence, not just his own transient forms. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through repeated contrasts (I/we, transient/permanent) that culminate in integration.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: restore the city's rhythm before the giant wakes. One clear tightening: Elias realizes he cannot fight the creature and must use its method against it, narrowing options. The pendant's resonance at the primary nest enables the tactic; he channels a focused moment into the sluggish water, producing a corrective echo. Cost is visible: the Chronovore dissolves (its agency ends), the nest crumbles to inert dust (temporal lattice destroyed), foreclosing the chaos path. Agency is protagonist-driven; coincidence (the pendant's unknown purpose) complicates setup but does not resolve—Elias must decode and wield it.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elian seeks to "map the precise topography of his ambiguous loss." Pressure tightens through the ritual sequence—glass eyes placed, energy channeled, the hum rising—culminating in the lattice projection that visualizes grief's structure. The resolution is protagonist-driven: his channeling of absence and memory creates the dovetailed pattern. Cost is felt: he gains "a profound and stable understanding" but explicitly not happiness, and the loss remains present. One meaningful turn (the light's appearance and interpretation) suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake: restore a lost family history. The outage creates urgency, and Elias's decision to place the tape on Anya's laptop is a tightening that narrows options (visibility risk vs. inaction). The fragment's charged energy differentiates it from prior finds, raising stakes. Anya's hope at the end reweights the opening defeat. However, Elias himself faces minimal cost—his work succeeds without complication, and no antagonist or credible obstacle tests his commitment; the turn is one-directional.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve the old structure or accept fundamental change—is signaled early and tightens through the failed repair attempt. One meaningful reversal occurs: the discovery of new tendrils shifts Elias from viewing collapse as disaster to recognizing adaptation as survival. The protagonist's agency drives the turn (he chooses to observe rather than force, then acts on that insight). Cost is visible: he releases control and abandons the preservation path with "months" of coiled tension. The nursery sale offer provides secondary pressure but remains backstory accent rather than on-page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (threshing meaning from experience) is signaled early and tightened through the exchange decision, which forecloses the option of keeping a valuable object. The woman's arrival and Elias's choice to trade the brooch for story constitute one meaningful reversal that narrows his options under pressure. Cost is legible: he gives up a material relic and returns with only narrative, yet the insomnia persists—Earned Stasis with visible price. Agency is renunciation with consequence, fitting the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Lyra's role as guardian versus the cave's desire to share—is signaled early and tightens when her visions fail. The threshold confrontation narrows options: her raised hand, the shadow-merge epiphany, her hand lowering. Cost is visible: she loses her clairvoyance and her understood purpose. Agency is clear in her final choice to lead Kael to the Heartstone. The cave's unpredictability and shadow communication apply coherent pressure. One strong reversal (her certainty eroding into obsolescence realization) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rebuilding shattered narrative through fragments. The valve's arrival mid-story provides meaningful tightening by raising the question of whether the archive can truly hearten survivors. The woman's testimony and her shift from despair to resolve deliver visible cost (accepting loss while choosing resilience) and narrow options (she commits to the city rather than retreat). One solid deepening under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more gradual accumulation than sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake (find the fortress) drives the journey with a single meaningful tightening: the brick wall that requires the punch to pass. The mentor constellation reveal shifts the goal from "find" to "accept guardianship," but this reframing occurs off Elias's agency—he observes and understands rather than choosing under pressure. No visible cost or trade-off appears; the "trembling certainty" simply becomes "absolute," which is assertion rather than earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—completing grandmother's work to sculpt a memorial space—is signaled early and coheres through all beats. The storm sequence provides one clear tightening: the acoustic pattern snags memory, forcing a choice between hurling the tile or engaging the data, which narrows options and forecloses passive grief. Agency is decision-driven (transcribing intersecting data) with visible cost (exposure to grief, loss of skepticism). The escalation reads cleanly under the Accumulative lens as density increase forcing synthesis, though the reversal moment could carry slightly sharper trade-off language.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: escape immortality by breaking the amulet's curse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the amulet "flared" in resistance and Xylos chose to embrace rather than fight it, narrowing his path to a single irreversible act. The cost is visible: dimensional vandalism, abandoning his sanctuary, stepping into absolute unknowing. Agency is clear in the protagonist's manipulation of fields and final crossing. The escalation path (anticipation → provocation → manipulation → mastery → crossing) is coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—repaying her father's theft with Mr. Silus's life—is signaled early and tightens through the prep ritual, forgery, and casket transport. One clear reversal: the envelope's arrival shifts from gamble to confirmation with felt cost (the week of uncertainty, the stakes of the breach). Agency is all Elara's; the plan's illegality and the 72-hour Ghost timer create persistent constraint. Cost is visible: she commits "the most dishonest thing she had ever done" and waits in heavier silence afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: collect textures to populate the silence. The accumulative pressure tightens in the pre-dawn passage as she waits for "the moment"—the lamp's hum wavers, sunlight presses against artificial glow, her pencil flies. The cost is her isolation and the fragility of each fragment against "the immense and growing quiet." One clear tightening when the sun rises and she must capture the waveform in real-time. Agency is execution and endurance rather than decision, fitting the Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned by her method and persistence, though no on-page complication tests her; the process succeeds as designed.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of memories"—is signaled in paragraph two and pursued through the accumulative method. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman's grief arrives and the narrator layers it with prior fragments, briefly achieving a "breathless moment" of possession before the ship's horn shatters it. The escalation is driven by the narrator's agency (choosing which fragments to layer, pressing them together) and the tidal rhythm tightens the window. Visible cost: the composite dissolves, leaving "silence" and the tin box. The single tightening and modest price (temporary illusion) fit the accumulative lens but lack a second reversal or a trade-off that narrows options beyond the narrator's acceptance of the cycle, preventing entry to the 8.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: decode Thorne's ephemeral compass to validate the universal riddle. Pressure escalates through Elias's experiment: adjusting tuning peg, achieving tone lock, witnessing dust-mote needle form. The reversal—compass points to empty floor—forces immediate reinterpretation under stress, narrowing options from "find a thing" to "find the site of an event." Agency is his decision to interpret the result and commit to retelling Thorne's story "note by resonant note" despite no proof for public consumption. Cost is visible: isolation, lifelong work, no audience validation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve Revel's freedom/identity against gentrification) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the inspector arrives weeks ahead of schedule, forcing the plan to face its test prematurely. Kael's agency drives escalation (conceiving the plan, enlisting Zola, embedding messages, watching the outcome) with a visible trade-off—accepting transformation to avoid obliteration. The cost is legible but quieter than ideal for high-band entry: "he hadn't saved the Revel from changing" acknowledges loss, yet the final beat leans more toward hopeful poise than felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—to photograph the last bloom before extinction—is signaled early and never wavers. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through elapsed time and the approach of dawn, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; Kaelen waits, the bloom arrives, he shoots, sunrise ends it. The cost (witnessing extinction) is conceptual and legible, but the protagonist's agency is observational rather than decision-driven, fitting the lens yet limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: repair the drone before the Stellamar lifts anchor. Three horn blasts escalate time pressure meaningfully, each tightening her window. Agency is demonstrated through her diagnostic method and repair choices under stress. The final success forecloses the failure path with visible cost (her exhaustion, sinking onto the stool). Coincidence does not resolve; her skill and method earn the outcome. One clear reversal: discovering the hidden strut fracture that makes the problem more severe than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the singular convergence—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's exhaustion of rational methods. The falcon's return and temperature drop deepen pressure accumulative-textually rather than through reversals, consistent with the inferred lens. The frost-map moment narrows Elias's understanding from "place to be found" to "phenomenon to be witnessed," a meaningful tightening. Agency is present in his choice to grab the spectrograph and witness rather than flee, though the cost (his life's work becoming "a joke") feels more conceptual than visceral at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the town's resonance—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when "other footsteps seemed to fall in time with his own," deepening the accumulation. However, no live option is foreclosed, no tactical trade-off surfaces, and the protagonist's agency operates without friction or cost: he walks, the town responds, and he will return tomorrow. The escalation is atmospheric rather than pressure-driven, and the final image promises continuation rather than a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    One dominant stake (capture the hush before life support fails) is signaled early and tightens via oxygen alarm and psychic chaos. The protagonist's agency drives the turn: he overrides flight instinct, searches the torrent, isolates the priestess's peace, and seals the vial—each step narrows options with visible cost (nearly dropping the vial, power flatline, death). The tightening is causal and the price unmistakable. Minor gap: the middle escalation (phantom pain, borrowed sorrow) feels slightly iterative rather than a distinct pressure turn before the final focus.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—proving a truth that will be disbelieved—is signaled early and tightens when he discovers the suspended men, then irreversibly escalates when he breaks the seal. The decision to open the door forecloses options: the moment collapses, bodies fall, and he must accept perpetual doubt. Cost is visible: "they will see the son of the liar, spinning another desperate tale." The accumulative lens allows pressure to build through density and recursive hush rather than causal reversals; the final act (breaking the seal) reweights all prior accumulation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (uncovering the debt and receiving the legacy) is signaled early through the bead discovery and sustained through the ghost bride's escalating appearances. One meaningful deepening occurs: the bead unlocks memories, leading to full recognition and the transference at the Phalaenopsis bloom. However, Elian's agency is largely passive—he observes, remembers, and receives rather than making a choice that narrows options or trades off competing goods. The escalation is told ("energy built towards a crescendo," "ghost bride grew bolder") rather than dramatized through a choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (Lyra's dissolution, Elian's solitude, the weight of continuation) but not viscerally felt as a price Elian himself pays or renounces on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving fragile dream-art against erasure—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the storm threatens. Kaelen's agency drives escalation: he moves from unconscious creation to conscious anchoring with visible cost (bleeding hands, frantic precision). The choice to sew pragmatic knots atop dream-threads forecloses the path of passive acceptance. One clear deepening occurs when overlapping paths coalesce into communal meaning, raising what's at risk. Cost is concrete and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore faith in lineage—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening: discovering the ship carving narrows Elara's interpretive options and reweights the interrupted-journey motif with felt cost (she must abandon her expectation of tragic narrative). Agency is embodied in her multi-day freeing of the stone and the choice to rebuild. Minor cap: the pressure accumulates more through reflection than through on-page obstacles or trade-offs that visibly foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transmit the new identity without digital surveillance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chalk code must look childish yet encode coordinates and temporal keys—the double constraint narrows his method. The final act (sealing the letter) commits to "slow, uncertain" surface mail, but the cost remains conceptual rather than tested by opposition. No reversal or complication; the operation proceeds as planned. Agency is present but unchallenged, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—exposing the coup before it occurs—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's realization, the encoding decision, and the transmission window closing. The telescope calibration creates a concrete deadline that narrows options, and the system lag ("heart-stopping moment") provides one meaningful reversal. Agency is clear: Elara's choice to transmit carries the risk of discovery and forecloses her anonymity. The cost is more implied than visceral—she returns to stitching, but the price of exposure or failure is not dramatized on the page. One escalation point is sufficient for this length, though a visible trade-off or immediate consequence would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Elara's task to evoke Kael's turning-point memory so he can understand his choice. Pressure accumulates through the spirits' swelling song, condensation forming words, and the scene shimmering in mist. The tightening is Elara's evocation narrowing to the specific moment ("the boat...your hand...a fear of drowning"), which reweights Kael's understanding. Cost is visible: Elara "swayed, the effort hollowing her out" and Kael's weeping marks his irrevocable confrontation with truth. Agency is present in Elara's ritual choice; Kael's passivity is structural to his role as seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bridging the conflict through shared human pain—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias chooses to translate fear of thunder rather than expose tactical secrets. Agency is clear: his decision to reframe the child's code as the father's own heart is a renunciation of transactional leverage with visible cost (he gambles trust). The General's response completes the pressure arc. One solid tightening under the Causal lens; entering 8.8+ would require a more explicit trade-off or a second complication that Elias must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rediscover lost joy—is signaled in paragraph one and tested through the painting sequence. Pressure tightens when "the image wavered, colors bleeding" and "the joy remained elusive," then deepens via the protagonist's agency: raising the fresco fragment to strike it with light. This action narrows options (the fragment becomes the seed) and the mural locks into place, forcing him to confront the forgotten face with visible cost. The ending accepts that joy is "not in permanence, but in the beautiful, fleeting act of remembrance itself"—a clear trade-off that forecloses the fantasy of permanent recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—escaping versus understanding the garden—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's shift from "prison, or perhaps canvas" to orchestrating existence layers. The escalation is Accumulative: each coin-flick teaches him control, raising the complexity until the seven-structure sequence converges bewitching on himself. Agency is clear in the final orchestration ("With a final, complex gesture"). Cost is legible: he trades the "predictable cerulean" and finite certainty for multiplicity, visibly altering his craft stance in the closing beat. No antagonist required under this lens; the nested structure itself supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve untaxable thought against the encroaching Synaptic Census. The wilting sunflower signals escalation ("a character erased"), and sirens force immediate action. However, the plan's sudden introduction bypasses a visible tightening—Kaelen's resolve is declared rather than tested through a choice that forecloses alternatives. The cost (potential cognitive wipeout vs. "a moment of pure, untaxable static") is articulated but not dramatized as a trade-off Kaelen visibly struggles with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to metabolize pain into beauty and find peace within endless wakefulness—is signaled early and tightens when "the pain did not lessen, but its texture shifted." That shift narrows her options: she can no longer hide her work in other shells; she must place the postcard itself at the heart of her home. The final act (writing the poem on the postcard, ensconcing it where moonlight strikes) is agency-driven renunciation with visible cost: her vigil continues, but longing is foreclosed. The escalation is more a deepening than a reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible in the changed sound that sailors now hear.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve Simple Trust before it vanishes—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: Elian must find the "ghost of a melody" and produce the "final, perfect note" to light the orchid, narrowing from general humming to precise resonance. However, no live option is foreclosed and no trade-off is dramatized; success arrives without a visible price that alters tactics or forces a choice between competing goods. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than reversal, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and remains tight: restore trust before final goodbye. The pressure escalates through the magical inscription process, where each glyph is a vow that "if broken, would shatter the spell and likely the caster." One clear tightening: the loop closes, nothing happens, then the manifestation forces Elara's choice. Agency belongs to Kaelen (his modification, his blood, his risk) and the cost is visible on the page—empty vial, vulnerability exposed, the binding structure itself. The resolution is earned by his action and her witness of that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding his father's silence—is signaled early. Escalation under the Causal lens occurs when the envelope adhesive reveals coordinates, then the chain's etchings provide the cipher key, narrowing his search to one wall section. The discovery of the letters constitutes a meaningful tightening that reweights his understanding. However, the pressure feels cognitive (puzzle-solving) rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option with visible cost; Kaelen's agency at closure is receptive (reading, realizing) rather than a choice that sacrifices something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: preserve Lena's music and the echo it represents. The storm creates a concrete, escalating threat that forces Elias into physical risk and collaboration with Anna. His revelation of the meteorite's truth and the pigeon gift represent agency, but the final scroll—a written phrase instead of music—does not pay off the established pressure around the musical fragments. The swap feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a tactical or emotional culmination of the pigeon-training and sheet-music stakes. Cost is present but not fully tied to the dominant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover why thresholds feel sacred, which braids with survival (finding passage). Pressure tightens through the logbook decoding sequence—violet pulse (temporal squall) and green shimmer (causal stability) forecast the white threshold. The final threshold choice narrows options absolutely: passage means permanent separation, a visible and irreversible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation works through pattern recognition that deepens understanding and forces the ultimate stance. Agency is present: he chooses to step through, accepting the terms.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (proving his theory to earn belonging) is signaled early and tightens through the sunrise deadline and Elara's skepticism. The light-jellies' arrival constitutes one meaningful deepening—Kaelen's months of mapping pay off, transforming isolation into connection. Agency is present in his choice to dim lights and wait despite Elara's doubt. The cost is visible: releasing attachment to the burnt home (feather's "sharp edges smoothed") to accept the present. No reversals mid-story, but the accumulative pressure model doesn't require them.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—complete the recollection before memory fades—is signaled early and produces one clear tightening: the turquoise light flickers, vines recede to dust, forcing Kael's desperate final conjecture. That intuitive leap (pressing glass to the map's dead-end) demonstrates protagonist agency and narrows options under the Causal lens. However, the time pressure remains abstract; no on-page cost accrues from delay, and the resolution feels more like puzzle-solution than a choice with visible trade-off. The "spark of intuition" arrives conveniently without prior setup of Kael's mental struggle or false attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: coax the extraordinary from mundane through calculated setup. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water reaches the coin-pusher, triggering the cascade. However, all moves proceed as Kael planned with no on-page setback, adaptation, or visible tradeoff—luck and precision align without friction. The couple's wonder registers as outcome, not a choice-forcing reversal for Kael. Cost legibility at closure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to activate the dust speck as starlight ink and pen the cosmic verse. Pressure tightens when the initial dance fails, forcing Kaelen to shift focus inward to the gaps between heartbeats. The anchoring and subsequent verse manifestation constitute one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present in the choice to focus inward, though the resolution ("spontaneously anchored") carries a passive construction that slightly undercuts protagonist-driven escalation. The cost—permanent transformation—is legible but not dramatized as a tradeoff between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve the atrium or accept transience—is signaled early and tightens at the pond. The deepening is driven by Silas's agency (the stone-throwing ritual) under the Accumulative lens. Visible cost appears in the renunciation: "He would simply remember this moment." One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible, though the smooth transition to peace undercuts the felt trade-off slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is Elias's need to translate pain into shared understanding, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Kaelen's comprehension narrows options from passive listening to active participation. Agency is attention and stance crystallization; Kaelen's tracing gesture forecloses the distance between them. The backstory fire carries a visible price (scars, the box's cracks) that alters present tactics. Escalation is textural—density increases until the phrase "bargained innocence" lands with "breathtaking clarity."

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—raising the vitality gauge of a dying parallel timeline—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure tightens when the needle dips toward zero, forcing a brief test of her calculation, then climbs with "quiet confidence," confirming her method. The escalation is modest (one reversal within the observation beat) and the cost is operational (pattern spent, materials scattered) rather than personal. Agency is present in her design choice and observation, but the protagonist remains more scientist than sufferer.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: discovering what walls dream about, which tightens into "a burden of knowing" when Elara uncovers the Prometheus formula. The escalation is driven by her agency (kneeling, tracing soot, piecing narrative, choosing to replace the negative). The cost is clear: she forgoes exposing a catastrophic legacy to honor professional boundaries, a renunciation that forecloses intervention. One meaningful deepening—realizing the formula was an accelerant—narrows her options and charges the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to plant seeds of light in the city's mirrors, offering glimpses of better paths. Pressure is situational and textural, building through the convergence of elements. One tightening occurs when the painter draws in the city's collective sigh and begins his work, but the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff or dilemma—he executes his plan without friction. The mirrors respond, people see possibilities, bells ring, done. Agency is present (his ritual performance) but the cost remains atmospheric rather than forecloses a live option. No reversal or complication tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving peace by anchoring ideals in ritual practice—is signaled in paragraph two and maintained throughout. Pressure coheres under a situational lens: Elias senses the generals' skepticism and exhaustion, then pivots to the dust-sigil tactic when "the moment was fraying." This one meaningful tightening forces the choice and narrows options (sign now under ritual weight or return to war). The cost is visible: Kaelen's trembling hand, Vorlag's surrender grunt, and the explicit acknowledgment that "the long, difficult work" has just begun. Agency is Elias's tactical adaptation and the generals' stance crystallization, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinct birds as penance—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's journey to the basin. The act of dissolution is a decisive narrowing: he chooses biochemical apology over resurrection, foreclosing any restoration path. The cost is visible: the last Song-thrush egg, the final chance to bring back the species, dissolves in corrosive brine. The "hollow resonance" and the thunder's return underscore the irreversible price. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and agency (his choice to commit the egg) drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—defying conformity by returning hidden truths—is signaled early and drives the rite, but pressure remains static: Elara faces no opposition, doubt, or risk during the untangling. The single tightening is the judge's final knot, yet the act itself ("mimed the final pull") compresses climax into summary without a visible tradeoff or failure point. Agency is present in her decision to perform the rite, but the lack of on-page cost to Elara—no exhaustion, vulnerability, or sacrifice shown—leaves the stakes conceptual rather than felt, and the prism's success arrives without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether Kaelen's subversive method harms or enlightens. The memory of the hollow-eyed man provides meaningful tightening by personalizing the abstract ethical question. The decision to perform a response show narrows options (he won't abandon his method but will answer it) with visible cost in effort and creative risk. One strong pressure point drives the turn. The escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the causal-reflective lens, and the final choice forecloses the simpler path of either retraction or continuation unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the migration's end through temporary structures—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates as Elias completes each lattice and knot, then tightens when the butterflies arrive "sparse, hesitant" and he must work faster to finish the spire. The final butterfly passing through closes the sequence with a visible end: "it was over." Cost is conceptual (the cadence silenced, the structures already dissolving) rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt trade-off. Agency is present but restrained; Elias builds without internal conflict or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving Lyra's forgotten name—is signaled early and drives Elian's meticulous rebraiding. The story offers one meaningful tightening: connecting the final strand and waiting for the sigil to appear. Yet the rope complies without resistance, the aurora answers "as if in answer," and Elian faces no trade-off or sacrifice; his action succeeds smoothly. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not narrow options or impose visible cost, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—discover why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and tightens through the storm's approach and the visions' playful obscurity. The escalation is Accumulative: each vision reweights the seal from lock to gate, and the final act (consuming it) forecloses all prior options with visible cost (he will drown, but present). Agency is clear: Kael chooses transcendence over preservation. The bunker collapse and rising water create undeniable urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—to reveal a celestial secret through ritual—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when the diagram mirrors the sky and the star-cloud blooms, a meaningful deepening that reweights his lifetime of observational thrift into a single act. The cost is clear: he dismantles all evidence and keeps the discovery private, forgoing recognition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. Minor note: the interregnum's "terrestrial chaos" is declared as enabling the "celestial window" but never tested on the page as opposition or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake is clear (heal Vale to stop reality's agony), but escalation is thin: Elara broadcasts memories, Vale recoils, Elara persists, then a catalyst appears and solves the problem. The recoil is a reaction, not a reversal that narrows Elara's options; she continues the same tactic until the deus-ex-light arrives. No visible price is paid by Elara—no stamina drain, no moral trade-off, no path foreclosed—only Vale's binary acceptance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: capture/recreate the father's lost dream. One meaningful deepening occurs when the breathing synchronizes with frost crystallization, narrowing the moment to pure discipline. The vision's fracture imposes visible cost—ephemeral success—but Elara's agency (the breathing Method, the gesture of picking up the sextant) drives the turn. No coincidence rescues; the fog and her father's ghost remain undefeated, yet she earns a map. Pressure coheres and tightens under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: mending the Heartwood (external) braided with reconciling generational conflict (internal). One meaningful tightening: traditional tools fail, forcing Elian to the "forgotten bag contents" and the ribbon-seed choice, which narrows options and reweights the repair from sealing to supporting. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency (planting the seed, wrapping the ribbon) with visible cost: renouncing his rigid method, leaving the ribbon behind as offering. No antagonist required; the crystal's resistance and Lyra's remembered words supply coherent pressure. Minor slip: the stakes hinge slightly on convenient object placement, though causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen's need to understand the orchard's temporal paradox despite his mandate—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the accumulating "pressure of the paradoxes" and the focused inquiry in the bathroom, culminating in the breakthrough that redefines his role. The cost is legible in the final lines: his "bewilderment replaced by a new and terrible clarity," suggesting both gain and burden. The escalation is more textural and conceptual than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens, though the peak moment leans toward epiphany rather than a forced trade-off with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the Library to save the future—is signaled early and tightens through the research sequence. One meaningful escalation: Elara must renegotiate with the Curators, requiring leverage she doesn't possess, which she earns through gap-research. The confrontation with the Curators narrows options ("Your purpose is to preserve knowledge... the future burns for want of them") and the Curators' acceptance opens the staircase. Cost is implied in the risk of facing "beings woven from ink and memory" and the "weight of all possible futures," but the physical or relational price remains abstract rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the Garden of Forgotten Names to recapture her twin's lost identity—is signaled early and tightens across three beats (carousel, gate, bridge). Each swatch use narrows her own memories, establishing a visible tradeoff: recapturing his story erodes hers. The bridge scene delivers the climactic realization with conceptual cost (no name to recover), and her final stance (becoming his story) forecloses the search path. One deduction: the progression feels more like a series of escalating revelations than protagonist agency driving reversals; Elara is a receiver of memories rather than making tactical choices that alter outcomes mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—integrating the impossible door into stable reality—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure escalates through one meaningful turn: the methodical weaving that narrows options and commits Elias to an irreversible act. The cost is conceptual (he's permanently altered the university's reality) but legible in the final image. However, the escalation feels more procedural than agonistic; no reversal tests his commitment, and the resolution arrives without friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding quiet amid alien noise—is signaled immediately and coheres throughout. Kaelen's agency is clear: he chooses to extract ice, internalize the pattern, and release it into the stone, each decision narrowing options. The escalation occurs in the terrifying flare when alien frequency meets conjured stillness, the cave shuddering and dust sifting—a visible price before the bloom completes. The resolution is earned by his action and knowledge; no luck resolves the conflict. The visible cost (exhaustion, cave tremor, the risk of failure) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to break the silence and signal other survivors—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through Elian's years of calculation toward the once-a-century alignment, then tightens in the assembly sequence where each fitted piece raises the cost of failure. The climactic moment when he hesitates over the shard of hush provides genuine tension: "perhaps the silence was the true state of things." The resolution is earned by his choice to press the shard into place despite doubt, with visible cost (his "ancient, immense" loneliness acknowledged). The alignment itself supplies the opportunity but Elian's assembly and final decision drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the discordant whispers to preserve collective memory—is signaled early and drives Kael's frantic shadow measurements. Pressure tightens through the storm's escalation and his "desperate" calculations, culminating in the alignment discovery. The reversal (ancestors created the fog rather than succumbed) reweights prior material and forecloses the option to erase it. Agency is clear: Kael chooses to record their choice rather than restore the memory. Cost is conceptual and relational (he honors their boundary), less viscerally felt than optimal for high 8s. The storm's role in providing the alignment reads slightly coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Kael seeks a cure for "the crushing silence that had fallen over the lands," his last hope against hopelessness. One meaningful tightening occurs when discouragement seeps in, then the knot discovery shifts method, leading to the wall schematic revelation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through sensory density and the weight of months-long silence. Cost is legible as renunciation of seeking a magical formula and acceptance of creating hope from broken pieces. Agency is present in the decision to filter pattern from noise, though the discovery itself leans passive—he lets the fortress speak rather than forcing a turn through high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: how Elara will respond to Kael's decision to leave. The tightening occurs through her internal journey from pain to understanding, narrowing from raw hurt to a specific stance. Her agency is renunciation with visible cost—she accepts the end of proximity. Under the accumulative lens, the escalation works through density increase (cicada metaphor, tidal pool analogies) that reweights the stake. Slight limitation: the pressure is largely internal contemplation; no secondary complication or external friction tests her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finding a silence that doesn't suffocate—is signaled early and deepens through the trellis encounter, which offers temporary exposure to vastness rather than permanent escape. The meaningful tightening occurs when gravity reasserts and he must test whether the collected silence can sustain him back in confinement. Agency is present: he chooses to push off the trellis and carry the echo rather than remain. Cost is legible: the walls still feel "too close," but now the gilded hush is "tinny and weak," a trade-off that forecloses the fantasy of either pure escape or comfortable confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: help the woman accept silence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian shifts her listening from seeking noise to hearing silence's architecture, and her unclenching marks the turn. Agency is teaching-driven rather than decision-under-fire, which fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice on Elian's part. The woman's transformation is more reception than active choice. The resolution is earned by Elian's method, yet the cost—his solitude, the cycle's perpetuity—is felt more than foregrounded in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake (fill the throne before sunrise or face system purge) is signaled early and remains live. Pressure tightens once: the sky turns violet, dawn is imminent, Elara presses the flake. The reversal—throne never needed a body—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (her expectation of ascension vs. the reality of restoration). Agency is decision-driven (insert the shard), but the story avoids a confrontation or trade-off between competing goods. The escalation is methodical rather than dramatic; the protagonist's wisdom enables success without forfeiting a live option or enduring a personal loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring Liam's capacity to breathe—is signaled early and tightens when Elara's ritual pressure meets his locked despair. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elara's deliberate encroachment via the scar-link) and results in a visible, felt change: Liam's shuddering breaths and the threshold transforming from fading to conduit. The cost is legible in the six-month severance and the "loaded emptiness" that remains even as it gains a pulse. One meaningful deepening under the Hybrid lens (situational + accumulative) forecloses the path of total isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing the Quantum Promise to prevent collapse—is signaled early and escalates when the farm overseers' brute-force plan offers a foil to Elara's channeling approach. Her volunteer decision is a meaningful tightening that forecloses safety, and the climax turn (screwing the bolt into the unstable node) is driven by her agency under the causal lens, converting unbearable pressure into tangible diamonds. The visible cost is her confrontation with "the pressure of a thousand lies" and the psychic toll of walking into "the heart of a star"; the resolution leaves her breathing steady for the first time in years, a felt price that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the reason for the dynasty's decline—is signaled early and drives the ritual. The crank-turning escalates sensory pressure (sub-audible hum to near-glass-cracking intensity) in a clear tightening that forces Elara past surface echoes to the core truth. However, the peak reversal (the dynasty was dismantled protectively, not fallen) arrives as an overwhelming flood rather than a choice Elara makes under duress, slightly reducing protagonist agency at the climax. The cost is legible (emotional release, reframing of identity) but felt more than forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prevent dissolution and preserve possibility—is signaled immediately and remains coherent. The tree's flicker and reality shifts tighten pressure in a single escalating arc. The peak choice (release the clasp at the precise cosmic alignment) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the old anchor with visible cost: the energy scours him, the program is destroyed, and he must begin his watch anew. The story delivers one meaningful deepening through the Weaver's Dance that narrows options to a single irreversible gesture. Agency is clear, and coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly Elara's search for "small kindnesses" to magnify, signaled early and tested throughout the discovery sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hidden message reveals the clerk's act of empathy, narrowing Elara's understanding and reweighting her grief into kinship across time. The cost is felt but not enacted with visible forfeiture on the page—her sorrow "shifted, making room for something else" rather than foreclosing a concrete path. Agency is present (she chooses to transcribe and reunite), though the escalation relies on revelation rather than a decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve truth against erasure) is signaled in paragraph one and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: network silence → plans unraveled → she must move now with only the key and puddle-map. The broadcast activation reweights the stake from tactical overthrow to symbolic seeding ("a crack in the mirror"), which forecloses the more aggressive path with visible cost (exposure, isolation, no comrades). Agency is clear: she chooses to trigger the node knowing it won't win the war, only "hold the line." The golden light intensifying as her activation pulses outward makes the cost and consequence legible on the page. Minor: one on-page near-miss (patrol drone hovering, a slippery causeway step) could sharpen escalation texture.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy before it can materialize—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates when the coded drips coalesce; Elias's counter-melody absorbs their rhythm, and the light shifts from chaotic flicker to steady pulse. One meaningful tightening: the prophecy falters, then vanishes. Agency reads as endurance and specialized action (playing through negative space) with modest on-page cost—lonely vigil, sorrowful notes. Under the Situational lens, the escalation is driven by protagonist response to the prophecy's emergence, forecloses the threat's syntax from becoming reality.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the prophecy message. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anomalous leaf with moonstone appears, narrowing Elian's focus to the speck as key. The "prod" is protagonist action, but the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than narrowing options under pressure—Elian's choice to prod feels inevitable given his role, not a trade-off between competing goods. Cost is present (world transformation, identity shift) but largely positive; no visible loss or foreclosed path accompanies the awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the trail's destination and understanding broken systems—is clear. The improvised fulcrum choice (sap, stone, resin) narrows options under pressure, and the cavern discovery reweights his goal from repair to witness. One meaningful tightening present. Cost is conceptual (foreclosing the tinkerer's mission) but legible in the final acceptance. The escalation is gentle; no high-stakes trade-off dramatized on the page beyond the choice to descend.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding the weight of Elara's name—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's escalating mystical pressure. The transmutation circle creates concrete constraint (balance between grief and joy, or the vessel shatters), and Kael's draining energy represents visible cost that alters his physical capacity. The coin's fracture and filling with light is a meaningful reversal driven by his agency and sacrifice. The resolution forecloses his original path (restoring life) while opening a new stance (luminous regret), with the cost—his spent strength, drained energy—legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—helping the spirit move on by integrating joy into her confession—is signaled early and drives the arc. The reversal is clear: chaotic notes → single clear chime → full melody, and the spirit's form brightens. However, the turn is prompted by Silas's question rather than earned through his own prior struggle or failed tactic; he arrives competent and succeeds on the first substantive attempt. The cost is visible in the spirit (decades of gray existence ended) but not in Silas, whose satisfaction remains untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving mercy has logic—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through the memory fragments and the increasing hum, culminating in the brace action and the interrogator's challenge delivered by the humming air. The tightening is meaningful: Kaelen moves from desperate grip to purposeful stance, forecloses escape as an option, and commits to understanding. However, the climactic turn is delivered via voice-in-the-air rather than a choice under live pressure, which dilutes agency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: honoring the overlooked history of the *St. Elmo*. The story tightens once when the painting's deliberate errors narrow options to this canvas, raising the cost of the revelation. The protagonist's agency drives the climax (holding the lens, focusing intention, unfastening the lie), and coincidence does not resolve. However, the peak action—"unfastening the lie from the canvas"—is summarized rather than dramatized with visible resistance or trade-off, softening the felt cost. No secondary pressure complicates the choice; the proprietor watches silently, and no obstacle tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Leo's choice to engage with the ghost's unease versus packing and leaving. The power cut meaningfully tightens pressure by removing artificial light and sound, allowing the ghost to resolve fully. The moment of choice—"This was the moment of choice, the fulcrum on which his quiet life teetered"—is dramatized with cost (physical effort, spiritual engagement, accepting his vocation). The escalation from routine repair work to spectral interaction is clear and earned. Minor slip: the ghost's resolution feels slightly automatic once Leo retrieves the barrel, with less friction than the setup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—destabilizing a perfect system to enable change—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation occurs through environmental reaction (hum, trembling, rupture) rather than protagonist agency or trade-offs; the Operator uncorks, traces, and waits, then observes the result without visible cost or difficult choice. There is one meaningful tightening (the rupture), but it feels inevitable rather than earned by prior decisions that narrow options. The "immeasurable instant" compresses all consequence into summary, and the resolution ("task complete") asserts success without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating the First Ones from "decadent tyrants" to "poets"—is signaled early and tightens when the storm arrives, forcing Kaelen to rely on the shard alone. The vision narrows his rhetorical options (no more abstraction; he must "translate the shard's silent poetry into the cold language of academic proof") and charges his resolve with visible cost: "Valerius would call it fantasy," and "the fight was far from over." Agency is clear in the decision to cover mirrors and expose the shard, then to commit to a new thesis despite inevitable resistance. One deduction: the escalation is more deepening than reversing—no live setback tests commitment mid-scene—and the storm's arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than driven by Kaelen's prior choice, though it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (restore the world's true pitch vs. encroaching rust) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias's doubt causes the chip to dim, narrowing options to renewed conviction or failure—this forecloses the path of self-doubt with visible cost (the chip's light guttering). The rust-voice provides pressure, but the reversal is a single toggle rather than compounding escalation, and the resolution arrives swiftly once Elias corrects his stance. Agency is present (his choice to embrace humble truth), and the cost is legible in the final chord that purges the rust.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: find the source of the impossible scent and the place "where explanations fail." One meaningful tightening: the compass spins uselessly in the maze, forcing psychometry—a higher-stakes method she "rarely used" that "drained her." The hinged stone discovery narrows her path and delivers her to the lagoon. Agency is renunciation at closure: she kneels, places the compass, and walks out without capturing the scent, foreclosing her profession's method with visible cost. Pressure accumulates cleanly under the Accumulative lens. No explicit antagonist needed; the maze and her own purpose provide sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (survival) is signaled when the colossal wave appears and pressure escalates through the ticking-clock structure of the approaching disaster. The slide's final layer provides both information and a narrow tactical window, forcing Elara to act with "desperate sync." The resolution is earned by her agency—physical replication of the pattern—with visible cost (exhaustion, soaking). The covenant theme braids neatly with survival but remains a secondary accent. One clear reversal: panic → clarity → action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and drives the quest. Pressure accumulates through weeks of observation and culminates in the multi-layered revelation. However, escalation relies on puzzle-solving rather than choices that narrow options or exact visible cost. The final revelation reweights the question (inheritance, strength in darkness) but Elara's path to it encounters no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would push this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlock the diary's truth—is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Causal lens. Kaelen's reframing from "why the conflict" to "what remains after" is a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The phantom's head-tilt and the "pull of the Aethelgard" signal a shift, but the cost remains implicit: weeks of isolation are mentioned retrospectively, not dramatized as a trade-off in the closure beat. One reversal is sufficient at this length, but the escalation would benefit from a visible price paid in the final negotiation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and clearly: reimagine the lost civilization through authentic memory, not hollow replication. Pressure accumulates as the scale (thousands of lanterns) looms against the slow, exhausting process (two lights achieved). The tightening is modest—Kaelen moves from despair-watching to active creation—but no live option is foreclosed; he simply begins the work he always intended. Cost is declared ("rest of his life," "agonizing") but remains future-facing rather than paid on the page in a choice that narrows present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (the city's survival vs. Elian's purpose) is signaled early and escalates through the prophecy. The story delivers one decisive tightening: the voice reveals the foghorn was a sonic bulwark, reframing all prior archiving as the lure. Agency is renunciation—Elian must choose between his oath and the people—with visible cost (his life's work becomes the weapon). Pressure coheres under the causal lens and the final dilemma forecloses both paths with felt weight. No multiple reversals needed; the single turn narrows options sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: save the collapsing pocket reality before it dissolves. The tightening occurs when Elara shifts from observation to action, extending her consciousness and gathering the fragments—a meaningful deepening that narrows the vortex's chaos into quieter cadence. The resolution (reopening the stable core) is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Minor penalty: the cost at closure is conceptual (fragility, borrowed time) rather than a visible forfeiture or tradeoff that alters Elara's options on the page. The story opts for Charged Poise, which is valid, but the price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to activate the sirens or enable listening—is signaled early and tightens through the countdown. The protagonist's agency drives the reversal: his repair work, his command input, his physical pull of the rope. The climax forecloses the institutional path with visible cost (defying clear protocols, accepting potential consequences). The countdown sequence provides a single meaningful tightening that narrows options to a binary, high-cost choice. The price is legible: he is "no longer silencing a storm" but has broken faith with his superiors' mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"to find strength in vulnerability"—is signaled early and crystallizes in the empathic plunge. The tightening occurs when Kael shifts from detached tracing to opening himself, raising the cost from aesthetic exercise to existential risk. The meteor's journey—"violent, frictional heat," "cold patience shattered in a final, incandescent scream"—externalizes the internal conflict and delivers a visible price: he feels terror and resignation before glory. Agency is clear: his decision to press the glass and empathize drives the turn, and the cost (transformation of his self-understanding) forecloses his former safe detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve unspoken words vs. release them; Lyra's pointing tightens the choice. The middle beat—"his vigil was over"—narrows options through protagonist realization (accumulative lens), and the final choice (opening the box) is driven by Elias's agency with visible cost: his strategy collapses, but the weight becomes shareable. The honeycomb reveal deepens stakes by showing shared burden, not his alone. No coincidental resolution; ghost dissolution follows causally from the box's opening. One persistent constraint (the tangled covenant) shapes tactics and the final image. Minor note: the phrase "a profound miscalculation" slightly summarizes the turn rather than dramatizing it within the beat; cost clarity at closure is otherwise unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and escalates through the garage sale experiment and the arrival of the cryptic message. One meaningful tightening occurs when the traveler's response ("ghost is the warmth of a willow tree") reweights the urn fragment's significance and drives Kael's final action. However, the choice to press the fragment to the wall is more discovery than decision under pressure; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and coherent. The kite's fall provides one meaningful complication, prompting Kaelen to seek fragments that "drift together." However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or a pattern break that narrows options; here the gathering of the feather and the mental poem feel inevitable rather than pressured. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path emerges on the page. The child's departure offers closure context but not a cost that alters Kaelen's tactics or stance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (completing the interspecies connection before death) is signaled early and tightens as Elias moves tree to tree, his body weakening. The final insertion of copper into the pillar's fissure is the single meaningful escalation—options narrow to this one act. Agency is clear: his decision to remodel drives every beat. The hum and glow provide immediate on-page consequence. However, the path is frictionless; no attempt fails, no tool breaks, no doubt intrudes. The lack of a complicating reversal or visible trade-off (he completes every step as planned) keeps this in the mid-7s rather than higher bands where cost would alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: to isolate and understand "the chemistry of homecoming" as an academically rebellious act against the prescribed cure. The tightening occurs through accumulative sensory and conceptual pressure—ghostly footprints pull him forward despite skepticism, the tower's stillness forces confrontation, and the mandala pattern crystallizes his realization. The placement of the amber is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses his former stance with visible cost (renouncing isolation, contributing his data point). The cost is legible: he gives up the perfect stasis he identified with and accepts expansion over conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—planting hope on a dead ocean's edge—is signaled immediately. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the birds' cryptic calls complicate his choices (salt depth, silt pockets), forcing him to translate their language into specific seed and placement decisions. One meaningful tightening: the gull's spiral descent leads him to the basin, narrowing his options from abstract to concrete. The ending forecloses passivity (he will return tomorrow) with visible cost (labor, depleted satchel). Coincidence does not resolve; the birds guide but do not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—bridging distance to her grandmother's world—is signaled early and tightens through the cylinder's riddle, the wasteland journey's risk, and the cave discovery. Agency is evident in Elara's decoding choice and her decision to journey despite danger. The cave revelation forecloses the path of seeking a person, reweighting the quest as nurture with visible cost (the journey, the acknowledgment of loss). One clear deepening when static becomes riddle; pressure accumulates under the accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping her perception to find a fixed point—is signaled early. The vision provides a single tightening that changes her knowledge, but it arrives passively (she "catches a glimpse" while sketching) rather than through protagonist agency or a choice under pressure. The resolution ("she was ready to explore") declares readiness without an on-page decision that forecloses a path or pays a visible price. The coincidental vision does the causal work, undercutting earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: amend the paradox's confinement by swapping the bone king for the wooden one with the seed. One meaningful tightening: Kael must act while Sylas is mesmerized by the light show, a narrow window of opportunity. Agency is clear—Kael's choice to plant growth over control forecloses a simpler theft. Cost is visible in the risk (caught mid-swap would fail the mission) and conceptual in the gift's irreversibility (Sylas now holds chaos, not certainty). Escalation under Accumulative lens: pressure builds through climb, entry, distraction, swap, and charged exit.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing the hidden prisoner—is signaled by midpoint ("another truth the Regent had surgically removed") and tightens through Elara's escalating risk: S-E-C-R-E-T, R-E-L-E-A-S-E, then the final raw grief that forces the Regent's hand. Escalation is protagonist-driven and narrows options (the Regent "narrowed her eyes, recognizing a performance but unable to discern its script"). Cost is legible: Elara forecloses her safe witness role, and the Regent's surgical control shatters. One more micro-reversal between the middle and final beat would sharpen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the shape of home as inhabitable concept—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: stone search, disappointment at inertness, feather-memory breakthrough, tactile method trial. The stone's failure deepens pressure ("disappointment felt like a physical weight"), forcing the feather discovery that narrows her options to a single vulnerable act. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses phantom escape and commits to soil-and-roots presence. One meaningful causal tightening (stone alone insufficient → feather texture unlocks method) suffices for this length under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signals early and tightens through a single meaningful reversal: the realization that the simple defensive move was right, not cowardly. The protagonist's agency—his mental winnowing and acceptance of his flaw—drives the resolution; the labyrinth click and hush unraveling follow his insight, not coincidence. The visible cost is the prince's irretrievable life and Elias's permanent knowledge of his pride. One coherent escalation path suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the Absolution will silence all voices—is signaled early and tightens when the horn sounds the ritual's approach. Elara's agency is decision and renunciation: she performs knowing the price, and the Wardens' arrival confirms the cost. The piece delivers one meaningful escalation when her final poem strikes the canyon and returns shattered, transforming the forged hush into "a symphony of fractured meaning." Coincidence does not resolve; her choice and the canyon's acoustics together produce the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: narrate history back into existence before the single breath expires. Pressure tightens through the rising cartography—first cataclysm, the Sundering, the Great Silence—each scar narrowing options as doubt poisons intent. The reversal at the heart crater (uncertainty crumbles, love surges) is protagonist-driven and forecloses evasion with visible cost: she pours meaning rather than facts into the final mark. The golden pulse pushes back oblivion with embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to keep a hidden promise by finding a place worthy of the memory. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the wrong turn and discovery of the oasis, which reweights the plan. One meaningful tightening occurs when the deviation feels inevitable rather than panic-inducing, narrowing options to this exact place. The act of dropping the shell forecloses the path of carrying it, with visible cost (the shell is gone, "its story complete"). The escalation is driven by Elias's agency (he chooses to release it), but the final moment reads more as acceptance than a trade-off with competing live options, capping the score below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Elias's silent beckoning versus Hemlock's failed foghorn blasts. The Stellaria's appearance is a clear reversal driven by protagonist agency. The cost is legible (Elias's focused silence, "minutes stretched into an eternity," the physical and emotional toll of channeling intent). One persistent constraint (the dead radio, the fog) shapes tactics effectively. The escalation is clean under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—building a lighthouse for the lost—is signaled early and sustained. The midnight phone call delivers the final instruction, narrowing Elias's options to placing the censer foot; this tightens the sequence but does not force a trade-off or test his commitment under competing pressures. The closure reveals the signal blooming, which reweights his grief into communal solace, but the escalation is more accumulative (weeks of building summarized) than a protagonist-driven reversal. The cost is felt (he hasn't brought his daughter back) but implicit, not a foregrounded dilemma with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety by protecting memory from compulsive disclosure—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: affliction worsens → search through discredited texts → costly trade → attunement ritual → test with neighbor. The storm provides environmental pressure that converges with emotional turmoil at the ritual beat. Agency is clear: Elias's choice to attune the relic during peak vulnerability forecloses total honesty and opens curated silence, with visible cost (truffles, storm endurance, the severance "click"). The neighbor's question functions as a concrete test that narrows options and demonstrates the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (decode the stranger's final gesture) is signaled immediately and tightens through accumulative pressure: Silas moves from observing absences to borrowed-memory fragments to final synthesis. The escalation is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through repeated engagement with the flower until "the final piece clicked into place." Agency is clear: Silas chooses to investigate and accepts the role of witness, foreclosing any path to active intervention. The cost is legible in the final image: he archives the stranger's ghost and accepts his own isolation as permanent. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the man "came because the ocean was the only thing vast enough to rival a mountain."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: fulfill Elara's promise by finding the doorway before the creek seals it. The rising water provides external escalation; Elias's internal tightening occurs when he sees the flickering lives and chooses not to enter. Agency is clear: he lowers the chip (decision/renunciation) and walks away, foreclosing alternate paths with on-page cost (acceptance over escape). One meaningful deepening—understanding the doorway as mirror, not exit—narrows options and reweights the promise. The resolution is earned by his grief-work and the chip's causal setup. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens through the midsummer deadline and the doorway's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unravel the dreams or succumb—is signaled early and tightens when the light promises erasure. The reversal (Kael's grip, Elara's pull-back) narrows options with agency under the causal lens. The cost is legible: she trades escape for duty, the "terrible knowledge and newfound brutal purpose." One meaningful escalation suffices at this length, and the coincidence of finding the grotto is foretold, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (capturing presence) is signaled early and tested at the climax. Kael's departure serves as the tightening that transforms Elara's approach; the act of pouring emotion into the sphere rather than relying on math is protagonist-driven escalation. The cost is clear: abandoning her lifelong method (dropping the nautilus) and accepting emotional vulnerability. One meaningful deepening with visible price, fitting the inferred accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: distill chaos into narrative to survive the chronologically confused state. The escalation is accumulative: jealousy of past selves intensifies until the flight memory triggers the waking trance, which narrows options by proving that integration is possible only through acceptance, not escape. The final turn—moving from triage to artistry—forecloses the survival-only stance with visible cost: he must chart the chaos rather than defeat it. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length; the protagonist's shift is earned by the sequence of reflection → nostalgia → breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Elara's need to find meaning in her transformed vocation, tested by the old man's request. The story delivers one meaningful deepening when she closes her eyes and reads the screw, a choice that narrows options (she cannot retreat to surface pleasantry) and forces her to deploy her new skill under scrutiny. The old man's tears and his recognition ("Her music") provide visible validation, altering Elara's stance from "fragile peace" to felt weight. Agency is clear: her decision to engage with the object drives the turn. Cost is present but muted—she risks failure and must inhabit her loss to succeed—yet the price could land more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: heal/understand the crystalline affliction. Pressure tightens when sacred inks fail, anxiety spreads new crystal, and the held breath becomes finite and heavy. The pivot to naming is a single meaningful turn driven by Elian's agency; it forecloses the scholarly path with visible cost and the shedding narrows to one solution. The coincidence of the grandmother memory arriving at the moment of desperation slightly softens agency, but the choice to "coax out" rather than "shout away" alters tactics under the inferred lens and the resolution earns its cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Julian must deliver his apology before the orchard (and house/archive) is destroyed at dawn. The ritual's activation is the key tightening: the hum, spark, scent, and sensory storm narrow options to this single moment. Agency is clear—Julian places the bottle, hires Vex, gasps the apology—and the cost is on-page: he drowns in the connection, receives acceptance not forgiveness, and the archive will be bulldozed regardless. The timeframe functions as a visible constraint that shapes tactics (Vex's urgency, the night-only window).

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unifying with the universal hush—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. The walk spirals inward without complication, reversal, or a live choice that narrows options. The final dissolution is presented as inevitable rather than as a decision with visible cost or trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or density increase to reweight the stake; here the tone remains static and the protagonist's agency is passive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and tightened once when the discrepancy appears "just after blowing the whistle." The discovery of the ice shard forces a choice: repair or witness. Elias's agency is renunciation (choosing not to fix the flaw), and the cost is legible in his professional duty being redefined. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, with the escalation driven by the protagonist's focus narrowing to the escapement and then the revelation reweighting all prior exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Aris seeks to decode her father's cipher and, implicitly, reconcile her certainty-driven life with his reckless beauty. The traversal tightens options as each scrawl narrows her path, and the final balcony message forces a stance crystallization. Agency is present in her choice to light the candle, an act of acceptance that forecloses the option of pure intellectual distance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the montage and the ending reweights the cost (her detachment). One friction: the weeks-long montage summarizes rather than showing a second on-page choice that visibly raises stakes or trades off a resource, slightly limiting escalation proof.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: teaching an ending to become a beginning for a suicidal caller. The hour-long conversation shows one meaningful tightening (the man's frayed "goodbye" recontextualized into "hello to what comes after"). However, the caller's shift is told more than dramatized—we are told his narrative "unraveled" and he "found a different kind of grammar," but we do not witness a concrete choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The resolution feels asserted rather than earned through on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving a lost moment to heal historical rupture—is signaled early and tightens when the photo reveals Lyra and Cael as lovers rather than rivals. The pressure escalates through Elara's chemical restoration, but the climax hinges on the jetty's miraculous blooms and Tomas's simultaneous arrival, both coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The ending reconfigures the feud's foundation with felt cost ("generations who had lived and died by a lie"), but the final turn lacks a difficult choice that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—curing Silas's loneliness by catalyzing fellowship—is signaled early and drives all moves. One clear tightening: when the crowd arrives but stands "awkwardly," their hesitation forces Silas to abandon his passive observer role and engage directly, narrowing his options. Agency is visible: he chooses to withhold the moon rock and offer practical help instead, foreclosing the myth-path with cost. The reversal (from waiting for magic to building community through shared task) is earned by prior setup. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; coincidence (the rumor spreading) complicates but does not resolve—Silas's final action resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake (finding silence to mirror inner peace) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: each discovered note builds the melody and quiets internal chaos incrementally. The climactic turn—realizing the final note exists "in the space between things"—forces a tactical shift from touch-based absorption to dowsing emptiness, which narrows options and earns the closure reweighting. The cost is legible: Kaelen must accept grief's persistent shape rather than its erasure, "its sharp edges smoothed into a bearable, known shape." Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the protagonist's attention and endurance drive the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—undo catastrophic mistake versus understand it—is signaled early and tightens when each hypothetical edit spawns new disasters. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: he theorizes, nudges variables, confronts cascades, and finally chooses transmission over revision. The cost is unmistakable: thousands remain dead, redemption is permanently foreclosed, and he unbends his will with full knowledge. One meaningful reversal (can edit → editing creates worse outcomes → must accept) narrows options and charges the ending under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through spatial progression (pylons → bench → ferry landing) and intensifies when the silence becomes "active, aggressive" at the nexus. Elian's final gesture is a "desperate, beautiful ballet" that "argues, pleads, demands," showing escalation in both method and urgency. The resulting chord and lifted weight register as cost paid: he has "ensured they would never be truly silent again." Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, though the protagonist's agency reads more as ritual completion than a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rescue Elara's truth from erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each discovery. The pressure-plate chamber gates the climax; once inside, Kaelen's agency ("he held it up, aligning it...") unlocks the hidden testament, a meaningful tightening that narrows options from rage-fueled destruction to painstaking completion. The cost is legible: he commits to labor over fire, foreclosing the cathartic repeat of arson, and the final image charges that choice with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breathing life into their shared dream—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when drumming accelerates from "hesitant" to "complex bridge," narrowing focus and deepening sensory translation. The ending forecloses reunion ("the space beside her where Leo should have been") with palpable cost. However, no reversal or external complication tests her commitment; the facility's stillness permits rather than resists, and the escalation is textural rather than agonistic. Under the accumulative lens this is valid, but agency remains unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—proving quiet competence superior to loud authority—is signaled early and drives all choices. Pressure escalates through the ticking clock (storm will break) and Kaelen's challenge, narrowing Silas's options to his archaic methods. However, the resolution lacks genuine cost; no tradeoff or foreclosed path is visible. The coin flip and key sequence provide tightening, but Silas never risks failure or pays a price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake: teaching the lonely darkness through light rather than banishing it. Pressure tightens when the water trembles, the air grows "thick and heavy," and Kaelen's focus narrows to "a single point of absolute resolve." The protagonist's agency—choosing the mirror, weaving the shutter pattern, aiming the spark—drives the single meaningful turn: the darkness's luminescent acknowledgment and the easing of dread. The cost is visible: Kaelen commits to permanent watch (one slat always open) and accepts the darkness's ongoing presence rather than solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—combating the Authority's homogeny prophecy with synchronized defiance—is signaled early and tightens once when the ninth bell chimes and the displays go live, shifting the town's subconscious chord. Elias's agency is organizational rather than confrontational; the cost is conceptual (a conversation begun) rather than a visible forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens this is sufficient, but the lack of on-page trade-off or foreclosed path keeps it out of higher bands. Maya's "I can draw that" functions as evidence of effect, not Elias's own price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (Kaelen's need for freedom vs. safe routine) is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: Elara's softened plea allows him to act. The cove ritual narrows options to a point of no return with visible cost—Elara's loss and his refusal to look back. Agency is clear: Kaelen pours his essence into the scrimshaw, severing the island's anchors. Minor: the scrimshaw's heart-unlocking power accelerates Elara's shift slightly ahead of her visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in forbidden grief—is signaled early and tightened once: the shift from theatrical narration (public mask) to silent whittling (private rebellion) narrows options and deepens interiority. The final act of placing the bird reweights the performance, closing the loop with visible cost (a shrine to silence, not joy). Agency is renunciation and endurance; no antagonist on the page, but the happiness mandate and Mara's memory supply coherent pressure. One beat short of 8.5+ because the escalation is more a deepening than a reversal that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Kael's pilgrimage to understand the colonnade's forbidden "grammar"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates as he moves from observation to immersive dissolution, and the "tremor of certainty" offers a deepening that reweights his understanding. However, escalation is largely internal and abstract; no concrete options narrow, no visible trade-off or loss occurs on the page. The resolution ("his work was to weave that passage into poems") is a stated intention rather than an enacted choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: awaken Lyra. Pressure tightens when Vex despairs ("impossible") and Elian offers the reed-tongue solution, narrowing options to this single barter. The final act—creating and sounding the glass sphere—is earned by protagonist agency. Cost is present but muted: Vex's tears and Elian's realization carry emotional weight, yet no visible forfeiture or trade-off alters later tactics. The coincidence of having the perfect reed on hand slightly softens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring the final bell's frequency of connection—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elian's weeks of failure force him to question his assumptions, leading to the apparatus-building turn. The climax lands with visible cost: he abandons sound for light, a methodological renunciation that redefines his work. However, there's no antagonist or meaningful external opposition; the conflict is entirely internal and intellectual, which limits urgency. The "smooth, unbreachable wall" metaphor tells rather than dramatizes the impasse.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—pulling her from grief's gravity—is clear, but escalation operates through patterned repetition (crane, fox, star, lotus) rather than mounting pressure or narrowing options. Each origami gift is essentially the same move: coordinates → telescope → nebula/view → small response. No reversal tests Elias's commitment; she follows each clue without complication. The final revelation (projecting the tattoo stencil) feels like the natural next step rather than a choice forced by rising cost. The "weeks later" epilogue tells us the outcome but skips the transformation beat where withering actually becomes bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elara's drive to map the blueprint of societal collapse, with Julian's need to understand as a secondary accent that converges at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara confides her father's unfinished work, raising the conceptual cost—she's not just analyzing the crypto crash but inheriting a legacy that killed her father. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns. The final image—"twin instruments poised to decode the next great and terrible thing we would build together, just to watch it fall"—reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost: the pattern will repeat, and Elara accepts the burden of mapping it. Agency is crystallized as endurance (Earned Stasis), and the price is legible: isolation, inheritance of obsession, acceptance of cyclical tragedy. No explicit antagonist, but the pattern itself functions as persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (unlock the Aethel without madness) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual sequence. Elara's agency is visible: she enacts the purification through unpredictable movements, and the cost—hosting the An-Korin's memories, dissolving her identity—lands on the page with felt weight. The revelation of the An-Korin's fate ("they had sublimated into memory itself") adds conceptual depth. One escalation turn (the method works, then threatens to consume her) drives the pressure forward under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve Elara's archive without erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael identifies the shadow's origin (the shared dream-fall) and narrows his method to integration rather than deletion. The final act—initiating the integration sequence and "presenting the shadow with the memories it had tried to erase"—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the slash-and-burn path with visible cost (the new silvery-blue hue, the mask breaking into "fragile, real" sorrow). No explicit antagonist, but the shadow's autonomous consumption creates pressure. The cost is legible: Elara's memory is whole but changed, and Kael's regret remains "a permanent resident."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: restore the chameleon and his own fractured sense of self. The prosthetic fitting is a single high-stakes reversal (tension, then acceptance) that narrows Elias's path and forecloses doubt with visible cost—he must hold perfectly still, telegraphing trust despite betrayal. The color change is the payoff, altering his self-concept. Cost is legible: honoring compassion means accepting vulnerability again. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias seeks closure through scar-reading but discovers the procedure codified rather than healed the break. One meaningful tightening: the tunneling reveals "not the clean, surgical slice…but a violent tearing." The ivy's withdrawal adds secondary pressure. Agency at closure is renunciation (he will carry, not close) with visible cost—he must live as "quiet, lonely archivist" and the "meteor hush remained, heavier." Pressure coheres and accumulates texture through layered memory until the hourglass realization reweights all prior moves.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the psychometric vision: scent, texture, Arthur's frantic heart, the projection ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara "followed the energy's path not from the man, but from the film itself," shifting the inquiry and leading to the answer. However, no reversal or tactical cost appears; Elara's agency is purely receptive. The resolution is atmospheric insight rather than a choice that forecloses options, keeping this in the solid middle band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: Elara seeks rest from the psychic static by freeing her trapped creativity. Pressure coheres through the nightly ritual and accumulates when the "different" silence and impossibly bright meteor force a conceptual breakthrough. The epiphany that reweights the static as "cosmic plainsong" is a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, though it arrives as revelation rather than through escalating attempts or tactical trade-offs. Agency is present—she actively traces, meditates, then chooses to sketch—but the resolution hinges on a granted insight (the meteor's message) rather than a choice that narrows prior options with visible cost. The final act (sketching faces) forecloses her instrumental solitude, an Earned Stasis moment, but the trade-off feels conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve archive fragility without betrayal—is signaled early and tested when the pine memory threatens to "shatter the fragile peace." The tightening is clear: Kaelen cannot erase (mission betrayal) or ignore (fabric tears). Agency is renunciation of the easy erasure plus active synthesis, with visible cost: the tree is "not truly" a tree, a compromise that forecloses restoration of the original. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, cost legible in the hybrid form and Kaelen's hand on the frozen clock.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the logic of the wilderness to chart his own soul—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: the protagonist walks, listens, and receives insight without encountering obstacles, tradeoffs, or tactical shifts. The "hum of insight" builds as sensory intensity, not as a narrowing of options or a price paid. The ending declares a shift from prisoner to participant, but no live choice, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path on the page. Agency is passive reception; coincidence (finding the tree) enables rather than complicates. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not tighten or deepen through protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage after the leash breaks—is signaled in the opening and reweighted at closure. One meaningful tightening: the guides' presentation of the blank ticket and star stamp forces Elara to internalize that readiness is a choice, not a destination. The walk and final turn into mist narrow options with visible cost (leaving the guides, facing the ridgeway alone). Agency is clear in the final step forward. Pressure accumulates through the texture of the journey rather than sharp reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's nightly tea deliveries and daily stair ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when he decides to place the bolt beside the teacup, a choice driven by his agency that narrows options (he can no longer hide behind silence) and forecloses the path of sterile coexistence. The cost is legible: "walked away without waiting" makes the gamble undeniable. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the recurring bolt and stair-stain accumulate weight until the final act reweights them.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the convergence of cryptic messages, tightens when Kael retrieves the pellet, and peaks when he dissolves it into the rune. The act is renunciation (library and keeper vanish) with visible cost: "his form grew translucent...dissolving back into the timeless dust." Agency drives the climax; coincidence does not resolve. One meaningful tightening forecloses the titan's existence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: discover why Lena and the reef "disappear." Escalation is causal—Aris reconstructs rhythms across weeks, the rare tidal confluence arrives, he taps the outer-current sequences, fails, discovers the spiral notation, and retries with the central beat. The neap-tide alarm creates a now-or-never pressure window. Agency is his assembly and the incorporation of the missing heartbeat rhythm. Cost is legible: the vision holds "only a minute" and recurs only under rare alignment, so he trades absolute arrival for periodic glimpses. One clear tightening and deepening under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reignite the failed rebellion by waking the ancient power the strategists misunderstood. The escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Elara's precise alignment and practiced hum narrow her options to this single attempt, and the monoliths' response raises the stakes by broadcasting the signal planetwide. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hum succeeds and distant receivers activate. The cost is legible—months of secret practice and the physical toll of channeling the stones' energy—but the piece doesn't dramatize a moment where failure or injury threatens to stop her, which would have elevated the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—countering reconstruction's uniformity with biological resilience—is signaled early and remains coherent. The unsealing sequence offers one meaningful tightening: Elara must orchestrate algae, ferns, and geothermal frequency in precise synchrony, narrowing her options. However, no reversal or complication tests her commitment; the process succeeds exactly as planned without friction, adaptation, or visible price. The embryo's activation is declarative triumph ("forever changing the landscape") rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative or forces a trade-off, leaving escalation present but cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Anya's effort to anchor optimism against the reality of trauma. The drone's arrival tightens pressure through embodied escalation (paralysis, ice in veins, spasming fingers). Agency appears as endurance—she searches for "a single, solid thing in the chaos"—and the cost is felt: she acknowledges the sky's permanent menace yet returns to care. The piece earns its quiet resolution through accumulative pressure rather than confrontation, and the final image ("just enough" water) reweights prior material with visible restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—navigating psychological fragmentation—is signaled early and tightens when he discovers the broken tarot box, a system for order now shattered. One clear escalation: his decision to redesign rather than mend, spending hours arranging fragments into a new spiral cartography. Agency is redesign itself, with visible cost (hours of work, charcoal-blackened fingers, the "long climb back" still required). The suffocating walls receding and ache transforming register the reweighting of his relationship to brokenness under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: discover why time slows in crisis, pursued via tracking the drone to its source. Escalation is primarily Causal with one meaningful tightening when the drone "darted closer" as Kael works the ink, raising urgency. The rockslide context establishes the stakes, but the on-page conflict is more pursuit-and-execution than a choice under competing goods. The final act (stepping into the ink) is protagonist-driven, though the cost—leaving his kin, entering the unknown—is more conceptual than felt in traded options or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve institutional myth or release truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the letter. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation: she chooses encryption over deletion, dormant networks over main stacks, immediate action over deferral. The cost is visible: "profound betrayal to the silent, sleeping figures" and the forfeiture of sanctuary. The purity purge provides external urgency, and the final act forecloses her safe archival life with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve peace versus violent inheritance) is signaled early and tightens through the knife sequence. The moment Elara grips the hilt is a micro-turn: "invitation to that world" versus "quiet here was older, deeper." Her agency—the deliberate act of sheathing—forecloses the path of violence with visible cost (containing rather than destroying the weapon, accepting heritage but denying power). The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres and reweights options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—catching the echo of a lost goddess—is signaled immediately and sustained throughout. The garden's shifting physics forces tactical adjustments (weaving around static, backtracking through rearranged space), and the spike-tapping method provides a clear decision procedure that narrows the search. However, the climax lacks a visible trade-off: Kaelen arrives at the hollow, performs the ritual, and succeeds without resistance or cost that forecloses another option. The escalation is primarily spatial (navigating obstacles) rather than strategic; no live alternative is visibly abandoned to achieve this outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—clearing her father's name by exposing the hidden truth—is signaled early and drives the phone confrontation. Celeste's "proof by contradiction" argument tightens the journalist's narrative, but the escalation is cerebral rather than a pressure-driven narrowing of her own options. The cost is primarily borne by the dead father and absent brother; Celeste's own risk or sacrifice in the moment remains abstract. One meaningful turn (the journalist's realization) occurs, meeting the minimum for this length, but the protagonist's agency in that turn is more rhetorical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the guilt-driven hum—is signaled in paragraph one and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian sees the translated cries and recognizes Lyra's voice, forcing him to act rather than flee. The etching sequence narrows his options: he must complete the constellation to silence the loop, and the final word "Papa" pays off the emotional cost. Agency is clear: his knowledge and the amber enable the solution, though the firmware's convenient vulnerability (etching circuits solves a digital ghost) leans toward soft coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in collective silence—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's mounting resolve after finding the tile flake. The mandala's creation represents one meaningful deepening: her visual argument against the void prompts a shift from isolated drifting to fragile communion. However, the other wanderers' agency remains passive observation; the tightening is driven entirely by Elara's action, and the cost (effort, vulnerability of offering without verbal response) is felt but not as acute as a trade-off or foreclosed path would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen's mission to erase traumatic memory—is signaled early and coheres under a causal lens. The renaming act is a single meaningful tightening, but it lacks visible resistance or tradeoff; the man's transformation is smooth rather than contested. Kaelen's "hollow ache" suggests a cost, but it's reflective rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option. The piece delivers escalation via the act itself, yet the pressure doesn't narrow tactics or force a sacrifice on the page—Kaelen's resolve is unchanged, and the man's compliance is total.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving Elara from despair—is signaled early and tightens through a clear escalation sequence: warmth → laughter echo → scent → applause surge, each layer raising sensory intensity until Elara's despair shatters. Julian's agency drives every beat; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is visible: Julian pours "all of his spectral energy" into the final echo, achieving his encore but expending himself (the "gentle, contented silence" implies exhaustion or completion). One small friction: Elara's choice to pocket the coin rather than flip it feels slightly under-motivated on her side—we see the effect on her but not her internal calculus—yet the causal chain from Julian's action to her shift is clear and the price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: finding a tangible language for their alleged connection. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias proposes "the real test"—the static shock memory—escalating from neutral grief to personal affection. The protagonist's agency (devising the somatic-marker system, choosing the second memory) drives both beats. Cost is visible: his skepticism cracks, foreclosing the option of dismissing her as deluded. The ending reconfigures their shared reality from "mass-induced delusion" to "their own perfect, irrefutable language," with the visible price of mutual vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: charting the null-space/unknown and becoming its voice. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens: she moves from external sensor observation to participatory merger, then returns with the translated waveform. Agency is present in her choice to lower the sensor and open herself, though the floating itself happens to her rather than through struggle. The cost is somewhat abstract—she becomes first speaker of a planetary language—but the waveform on the sensor and her altered quest ("no longer abstract motivation") make consequences visible. No overt antagonist; pressure coheres through intensifying emotional residue and the overwhelming consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is established early: unscramble the prophecy to unlock a new future rather than accept doom. Pressure accumulates through the shrinking hourglass ("nearly empty now") and the systematic cataloging that gradually clarifies the ancestor voices. The final button—the fire-warden's toggle—delivers the key reversal: the prophecy is not fate but "a crossroads," a missed choice. The escalation reads as density increase under an accumulative lens (pattern break when cacophony becomes a single clear voice). Cost is visible: Kaelen abandons his duty and walks past the hourglass, forfeiting the known ritual. One tightening issue: the stakes remain abstract (the city's "final generation") without on-page lives or immediate consequences grounding the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—fix what's broken by rescuing the colleague—is signaled early and tightens when Kestrel reveals she's alive and hunted. The meeting itself is a reversal (she's not dead), and the snow-code method imposes a tactical constraint (ephemeral, must memorize). However, the escalation is more revelatory than agonistic: Elias faces no on-page dilemma between competing goods or costs; he simply learns new information and commits. The closure cost is implied (future danger) rather than a present forfeiture that narrows options in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: reconciling the palimpsest promise—how to understand a vow layered over with years of necessity and silence. The tightening occurs when the memory's complexity presses against the fog-bound stillness, forcing Elias to distill its essence; the final crystallization (promise transformed into persistent compassion) forecloses the path of literal return with felt cost. Agency is contemplative but active: he "did not fight the memory but let it breathe," and the deliberate act of pocketing the needle signals readiness to move forward unburdened. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens is sufficient; the cessation of rain and hammering marks the pressure point where understanding coalesces.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen grasps the phototropic-to-kindness principle. His choice to rebuild the channel is agency-driven with visible cost: he forgoes food and rest, committing his craft entirely. The escalation follows accumulative logic: observing → intuiting (glass shard) → testing (watering rose) → full commitment (channel repair). No forced reversals; pressure deepens through each compassionate act until the final answer arrives with his hands still clay-covered.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: to instill light/connection into Mr. Henderson's darkness. One meaningful tightening occurs when she commits to nightly repetition after the rosebush fails. The blinds widening is a reversal that narrows her solitude and validates her method. Pressure accumulates through ritual and the "quivering hush" of waiting. Cost is visible in her sustained physical effort and the hour-long rhythm; she forgoes rest and comfort to persist.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens when Kael approaches the stone circle despite fear. The brittle awakenings provide escalating pressure ("complete immersion in the graveyard of his memory"), and the hum acts as an anchor that prevents collapse. The resolution is driven by Kael's choice to engage the stones, though the turn from fear to acceptance happens more through realization than a decision that forecloses a live option with sharp cost. One meaningful deepening is present under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—will Elara let go of her last tangible link to connection—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when she watches others contribute and feels "kinship and terror," then the sunlight transforms the web, forcing her decision. The choice to place the nest forecloses her isolation with visible emotional cost. Agency is clear in the final act, though the sunburst that triggers understanding borders on convenient timing rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (stop the tricksters before they break the community) and tightens when tonight's transmission correlates with the violent town hall collapse. Elara's agency drives escalation: she reverse-engineers the method, engages the sequence, and the counter-frequency breaks the fever with visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing vigilance, tricksters will adapt). The price is legible in the final paragraph ("ready tomorrow night, and the night after"). One clear reversal occurs when the young woman lowers her sign and the man's fury softens—earned by Elara's on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the Architect's lost key—is signaled early and tightens when the organ chord escalates spatial mutiny into life-threatening chaos. Elias's agency (choosing to play the chord, then aiming the compass point) drives the climax, and the cost is embodied: claustrophobia threatened to extinguish him, and the final act required precision under duress. The folio's revelation that the "key" is architectural knowledge rather than a metal object deepens thematic weight, though the coincidence that the keystone's position solves everything leans on fortune.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy—is signaled early but remains largely internal and abstract. Pressure accumulates through the methodical ritual and opposing-forces technique, with one meaningful tightening when the scratch/wound insight strikes. However, the escalation lacks a trade-off or visible cost in tactics; Elias seeks empathy, paints methodically, and achieves his goal without complication or sacrifice. The "not for justice, but for a far more selfish and desperate reason" framing promises internal conflict that never materializes as on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—vindicating Eva and revealing the hidden continent—is signaled early and sustains pressure. One meaningful tightening: finding the journals escalates to decoding, then to the physical quest, then to the reversal rite, each narrowing options. The final act (opening the secure channel) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (institutional exposure, ending his obscurity). Minor weakness: the journey to the cove faces no obstacles; the nail fits perfectly, and the discovery proceeds without complication, reducing felt danger in the escalation phase.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias finding his own door/amnesty—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates through lyric observation (the glass flake, the fluttering code) but lacks a mid-story tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending shift from passive witness to active musician is a tonal deepening rather than a reversal with visible cost. Coincidence (Lyra's appearance and vanishing) sets the stage but does not resolve; Elias's agency at closure is present but its cost remains implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias must protect his sanctuary without resorting to his father's violence—is signaled early and tightens through the territorial-marker campaign. The CEO confrontation is a clean reversal that narrows the startup's options, and the company's fall is causally linked to Elias's sustained pressure. Cost is visible: he risks discovery, employs manipulation, and accepts solitude. The "paths of ravenous hunger" pattern deepens the thematic stakes without diluting the immediate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: decode the inscriptions. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the dream reframes the glyphs as lament rather than cipher, narrowing Elian's tactical options from decryption to witness. Agency is present in the final writing act, which forecloses the family quest and accepts a new stance. Cost is felt—he abandons the ancestral puzzle—but remains somewhat abstract; we don't see what he loses by refusing further attempts. The variable-star observation as escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a pressure test with visible tradeoffs. Under the Accumulative lens, the single deepening suffices, but the price could be more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find his frozen confession) is signaled in paragraph one and pursued through the three-circle ritual. The vortex breach in paragraph three constitutes a meaningful tightening ("the world screamed in her mind") that forces her to dig deeper with visible cost ("her own guarded nature cracking"). The branch's resistance and her pouring of life force into the unbending effort narrows options and raises the price. Agency is clear: Elara's will straightens the branch, releasing the confession. The resolution (planting the seed) flows from protagonist choice with felt cost (her fortress walls crumbling, weeping).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: find the intersection to re-knit frayed edges of existence. The pressure tightens causally: she initiates ritual → links to Kael → receives his warning of a false intersection → must synthesize warning and clipping-logic → creates a new path. Agency is decision-driven: she chooses to push the clipping's logic against Kael's warning, actively creating the vector rather than discovering it. The final tightening ("The intersection wasn't a destination to be found, but a vector to be created") reweights options with visible cost: her palm burns, the boundary grows permeable, and she anchors by roots. No coincidence resolves; her synthesis drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—healing Elara's void—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow threatens the sapling. Aris's agency (offering his memory) forecloses the path of violent resistance and narrows his store of lost futures. The root-touching-bone breakthrough provides visible consequence. One clean reversal (threat → sacrifice → sated shadow) with cost unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "gnawing need to discover purpose after loss, to find a signal in the noise of memory." The physical struggle to free the cloth from the recorder provides one meaningful tightening—"a fight against a ghost, a tangible tug-of-war with the past"—that narrows options (he could abandon the box but chooses to persist). The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length: the cloth snags, he must work it free with scraped knuckles, and when it comes loose the sensory flood forces a choice. The cost is legible: by keeping the cloth on his desk rather than boxing it away, he forecloses the decade-long project of emotional insulation. Agency is clear throughout; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—to prove their shared belief in ordered existence has not died with Kael—is signaled early and tightens when Elara plants the seed as "an attempt to create a bridge." One meaningful deepening: her waveform analogy forecloses pure mourning ("not one of mourning, but of inquiry"), and the sprouting filament answers her question with visible consequence (the hum's shift, her move from torment to anticipation). Agency is decision and endurance: she chooses to reestablish connection through the seed with visible cost (the distance remains but is reweighted). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the ritual's density and the final image's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder by refining trapped grief into peace—is signaled early and pursued through the smelting ritual. Pressure accumulates via the rising tide and persona migration, creating one meaningful tightening as Kaelan plunges hands into the basin and accepts "searing pain" and "sharp joy." However, the smelting succeeds without visible resistance, failure risk, or tactical adjustment; the outcome feels ordained by the cycle rather than earned by agency under duress. No live option is tested or foreclosed; the ritual completes as designed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to repurpose the bunker's closure ritual to broadcast connection—is signaled early and tightens once through Elias's discovery and decision. The hesitation beat ("his oath as an inspector, the logic of survival") names the conflict but does not dramatize a live tactical dilemma or visible tradeoff on the page. The final act is driven by protagonist agency, and the conceptual cost (forsaking his role, reversing the bunker's purpose) is clear, though the moment lacks a felt material price or secondary complication.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—path to self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when the graffiti reframes the entire quest as misplaced externalization. The accordion's two-note breath sequence (push/pull, exhale/inhale) narrows options by acknowledging "everything" without fixing it, a micro-turn that sets up the walk-out. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: leaving the father's music forecloses the map-based healing path. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the final image reconfigures guilt from destination to carried tributary.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (find the unspoken words before the second letter arrives) is clear and sustained, and the ticking-backward watch creates a felt time pressure. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—she captures phrases, approaches the central chamber, and finally documents "Stay"—but there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The resolution lands through discovery rather than a decision that forecloses a competing path, and while the cost (time spent, the messenger approaching) is implied, it is not dramatized as a visible price paid in the moment, which prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: finalize the violin's false provenance before the Empress's address. The plant-memory and coffee-stain prophecy tighten pressure by converging into a truth that forces a binary choice. The final act—cutting the vine and writing the truth report—is protagonist-driven agency with unmistakable cost: he trades his career, comfort, and allegiance for a fragile cutting. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the violin is "a tear frozen into music," reweighting his entire career as "authenticating elegant brutalities."

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capture the spark before oblivion claims it—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs: the search through static narrows to the single joyful memory, then the infusion itself. However, the protagonist faces no live friction or trade-off; the process succeeds without adaptation or visible price paid on the page. Agency is present (she finds and captures the memory) but the escalation reads as smooth execution rather than pressure forcing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the Heart-Bloom's cycle and understanding contentment—is signaled early and tightens when Elara sees the pooling water problem from the tree. Her choice to scallop the soil is protagonist-driven and forecloses the passive observer path her lineage followed. The visible cost is the decisive break from inherited method, and the light's pulse confirms the trade-off. However, no secondary complication arises; the scalloping succeeds immediately without friction or setback, which slightly softens the escalation curve expected in the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Kaelen wants validation for "righteous justice" but the act feels hollow. Pressure tightens through the brass-chime clang ("his certainty was fighting back") and the hollow mirror confrontation that externalizes the void he would create. The clasp-unhooking is protagonist agency that forecloses the revenge path with visible cost (shivers, lighter but "less certain"). One meaningful reversal: the wind chimes shift from discordant brass to layered harmony after the cloak falls, reweighting the initial conviction. The cost is scaled appropriately for this length and legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kael wants to "cross the ocean in a single step" to find his sister. The meditation trance provides one meaningful deepening—the backward-flowing rings reveal that his desperate desire "shackled him to this single point of wanting." The reversal (rings contracting) narrows his tactical approach: he must retract self and ego. Cost is felt in the final release and Elara's smile reaching her "ancient eyes," affirming the knowledge transfer before her own retreat. Agency rests in Kael's perceptual shift, a stance crystallization with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to learn consciousness-navigation by understanding the discordant pulse. The tightening occurs when the flock fractures, revealing the hunter's story and transforming the task from silencing to guiding the pulse. Agency is clear: Kaelan chooses to hum and pour the reassuring thought rather than throw the arrowhead, a renunciation of crude action consistent with reverent nature. The cost is patience (centuries of listening) and the psychic expenditure of the harmonic gesture. One meaningful deepening (flock-reading) narrows options and changes knowledge, fitting the Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned by Kaelan's alteration of method (guiding rather than silencing) with visible cost in the final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kael seeks the source of lingering luminance to validate his misaligned talent. Escalation is causal: diagnostic tools fail → despair tightens → realization prompts unstrapping → keystone touch reweights options. One meaningful turn (removing the pack) narrows his approach and forecloses reliance on automated craft with felt cost. The price—abandoning his Academy tools and worldview—is visible on the page. Agency is clear, though the final beat's abstraction ("the most powerful magic of all") slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a luminous vow to "see" Elara's music—is clear from paragraph two. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: ritual lighting → descent during the one viable tide → switching off the light in the library to achieve sensory deprivation. The turn is internal: letting memory "fill him" triggers the indigo impression. Cost is implied (ten-year pilgrimage, exhaustion, risk of the dive) but not viscerally dramatized in the moment of discovery; the answer arrives without on-page struggle or trade-off in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: align with the new universe's will or remain alone in static. One meaningful tightening when the stubborn pulse demands total power commitment (burn-out risk). Agency is decision (coin draw, recalibration) and renunciation (accepting curator role over prophet). Cost is visible: "pit of stomach tightened with failure," risk of sensor loss, and the conceptual forfeiture of his future-seeking identity. The coincidence that the copper coin unlocks the memory signal is allowed under Situational/Hybrid lens (complicates, doesn't resolve; resolution is his acceptance). One more intermediate friction (e.g., a smaller failed filter attempt) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: to give form to shapeless grief and avoid being consumed by Elara's absence. The piece tightens through one meaningful pressure point—the crystallization act itself—where Kael channels memory and light into substance, foreclosing the option of remaining adrift. Agency is present in the deliberate choice to perform the ritual and then place the crystal on the console rather than hold it; this renunciation carries visible cost ("He did not feel healed"). No antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens; the deepening operates through escalating sensory and symbolic density until the final image reweights his relationship to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—waking the world by rebuilding its fundamental song—is signaled early and tested through ninety-seven days of failure. Pressure tightens when Kael realizes it's the silence *between* drips that matters, narrowing his options to one final adjustment. The resolution is earned by his agency (adjusting the flow) with visible cost (exhaustion, spent magic). The patch of moisture forecloses retreat and validates the attempt without delivering full success, fitting the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Elias's vigil and the "loss felt measured in ghosts." One meaningful tightening: the photograph trail narrows from anonymous woman to his own great-uncle, raising personal and communal cost. The climactic choice—correcting the ledger—is protagonist-driven and forecloses passivity (he signs as warden, accepting accountability). The cost is visible: official record alteration, public vulnerability. Agency reads as decision with on-page consequence. No antagonist, but the stain on memory and community poison create coherent pressure. One micro-reversal (grandfather as storyteller, not liar) deepens rather than redirects.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: harmonizing logic and intuition. The pressure deepens from "cold and sharp frustration" → abandoning alembics → letting go of analytical mapping → approaching the tree on impulse → sublimating the crystal with reverence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes "the missing element wasn't a reagent. It was reverence. It was memory." The cost is legible (dissolving his intellectual cage), though the escalation is more internal deepening than external narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve trust, avert panic) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs at the crystal dial—the tremor creates a live trade-off with visible cost. The buckle ritual earns the steady hand, avoiding coincidental resolution. The ending reconfigures options (fleet warned, world sleeps, consequences spreading) with felt cost in the "hollow ache." Agency is clear: Kael's choice to revise the charts drives escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—defeat numbness by creating new feeling—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael ignores Jin and proceeds with the vivify, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off (risk of failure, Jin's opposition, drain of self). The cost is partially legible: "a pulling sensation" and the final responsibility, though the latter trends toward label. Jin's interference adds situational pressure but deflates quickly. The story reaches strong mid-band execution with visible agency and a foreclosed path, yet the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally enacted, preventing entry to 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled in paragraph two and drives every beat. Escalation proceeds through the ghost's three pull-cord attempts, each gathering more resolve, culminating in the engine's roar and the wife's recognition—a tightening that forecloses the silence with visible cost (her tears, his "sliver of peace"). Agency is renunciation and endurance wrapped in noisy communication; the ghost cannot hug or joke, only orchestrate elements. The leaf-macerating beat adds tactical specificity (shredding emblems of grief) that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (return home vs.守 duty) is signaled early and tightens when the pendant burns and the portal tears open, forcing a live choice. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Lyel grasps the pendant and actively smothers the cultists' signal with his own longing rather than leaping through. Visible cost: the vision of home dissolves, the pendant becomes "cold, dead metal," and he remains in exile but reframes his wait. One clear reversal (temptation → renunciation) with felt consequences that alter his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake is clear early: interrupt the stifling destiny by achieving vivification. The piece escalates via successive approximation across 72 failures, with mounting cost (each attempt destroys irreplaceable material). The epiphany is protagonist-driven and narrows options—he commits the last fragment with a new method. The final light-flower concretely demonstrates success with visible price: the crozier is unmade. However, the final attempt encounters zero resistance or new complication; the resolution feels slightly frictionless once the insight lands, lowering the felt cost at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the shard of hush—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The perigee zenith creates one meaningful tightening: system overload threatens failure, forcing Elara's final dial adjustment under pressure. Agency is decision-driven (discarding assumptions, jury-rigging placement), and the cost is legible: risking her equipment and defying standard protocols with no fallback. No forced reversals; escalation is causal and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (escape/heal the rupture) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Finn realizes he must merge timelines rather than simply call for help. His agency at closure is clear—manipulating the radio dials—but the escalation is cognitive (noticing patterns) rather than forced by rising external pressure. The cost is told ("permanent transient") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture that alters his tactics or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake ("discover the texture of connection") is signaled early and pursued consistently. The memory shift forces a tactical choice: Elias "did not fight the change but incorporated it," tightening pressure through the thread's color deepening and pattern growing "more intricate, more dangerous." The final act—weaving the cold texture into the lattice—triggers the vision and traps him, a protagonist-driven turn with visible cost. One clear escalation under causal lens with cost legible on the page ("beautifully enchanted cage").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kaelen must learn to navigate by starlight, driven by professional duty and spiritual need. One meaningful tightening: his secret research yields a breakthrough, and he escalates by presenting it to the council. The council pitch reweights options conceptually (anchored city vs. new chain to the stars) but lacks a visible on-page cost beyond Director Valerius's earlier chiding. Agency reads as endurance (working in secret despite dismissal) and then declaration, both consistent with the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres and the resolution redefines the city's mission, though the trade-off remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: close the circuit between Elara's spirit and Leo. One tightening occurs when the frantic pulse softens, signaling mission success. However, Elias faces no obstacle, reversal, or trade-off—he walks, scans, finds Leo, speaks, succeeds. Leo's internal struggle is summarized ("I feel like I'm failing") rather than tested on the page. Agency is present but unchallenged; no credible loss or tactical shift is visible, limiting escalation under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (grant grandmother peace) is signaled early and tightens through the collapse obstacle, forcing the phase-transition choice. The tidal clock and claustrophobia create layered pressure. The ending forecloses the haunting with visible cost: he's alone now, duty discharged. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes he cannot squeeze through and must use the codex method. The cost is legible and scales well to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (salvage wisdom from Aris's digital ghost) is signaled early and sustained. The accumulative lens allows one meaningful tightening: the ink patterns shift from "meaningless blooming fractals" to "sudden purpose" with the star-chart diagram, narrowing options from noise to signal. Agency is present in Elara's deliberate ink-guiding action and her acceptance of the gap-wisdom at closure. The cost is conceptual—she must reframe her bureaucratic error as potential rather than curse—felt but not viscerally physical. No explicit antagonist required under this lens; pressure coheres through the ritual's difficulty and the epiphany's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the Old Tongue by translating texture into sound—is signaled early and tightens through Kaelen's years-long search, the diamond's discovery, and the final starling-pattern moment. The dusk alignment is a clear escalation point that narrows options to a single attempt. However, the resolution is delivered by Kaelen's agency without visible opposition, internal conflict, or trade-off at the peak beat; success arrives cleanly once the method is enacted, leaving the cost implicit rather than dramatized. One meaningful tightening is present, but the closure lacks a felt price that would charge the final image under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (expose Elara as monster) is signaled early and tightens through discovery → witnessing → realization that forecloses the original path. The transformation scene narrows Julian's options: he can no longer sustain his bitterness-as-motive framework. Agency is clear in the final renunciation—setting down the phone is a decision with visible cost (abandoning his job, protecting the garden instead). The reversal from "villain" to "creature of the loam" and the client's metamorphosis provide escalation under the causal lens, and the final cost (accepting Clara's irreversible change) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake—reawakening the orchard—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Elara places the shell and plays, triggering the Wardens' charge; this narrows options and forces her to "pour more of herself into the music." However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or loss: the vines resolve the conflict without Elara paying a legible price (stamina, injury, or a forfeited path). The phrase "not of violence, but of reclamation" softens the cost, and the resolution reads as nature's victory rather than protagonist agency under duress. No persistent constraint shapes her final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reuniting a family's lost daughter via illegal data transfer—is signaled early and escalates through the timed convergence of drone gaps. Pressure coheres: Elias must act within a thirty-second window when the static wave blinds the network, and the predatory hum's return marks the closing of that window. Agency is clear: Elias's weeks of mapping, his choice to uncork the bottle at the exact moment, and the upload are all protagonist-driven. The bluebird confirmation provides visible cost (energy spent, risk taken) and earns the resolution. One tightening suffices at this length; the countdown and brief window force the action into a single, irreversible move.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias seeks to complete his restoration and find purpose in the silence. The piece tightens once meaningfully when he decides the fragment "belonged with the lead horse" and works for days to install it, culminating in the singing that reweights the quiet. Agency is present: his decision to crown the mare and his choice to open his mouth and sing both foreclose paths (the silent retreat becomes voiced presence). The cost is felt in the decade-long silence breaking. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient but relatively gentle; one more intermediate complication or visible tradeoff (e.g., a failed first attempt, a moment of doubt that threatens the work) would have sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake ("to find the place where stories live") is signaled early and drives all action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the scarf arrangement shifts from preparation to manifestation—the vision flickers, then dissolves, narrowing options to "proven the path" rather than capture. Agency is clear: Elias's meticulous choices (book placement, scarf tension) enable the contact. The cost is legible on the page: he has not captured the story, only touched it, committing him to further patient work. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream to fill the aching void—is signaled early and tightens when the "strange stillness" and fog-bank moment arrives as "the final piece." The reversal is the discovery that this particular light completes the cipher, causing the palette to hum and the wells to resonate. Agency is present: Silas recognizes the moment, acts, and chooses to vitalize the dream. Cost is visible in "years" and "a thousand failed attempts," though the final act feels more like fulfillment than a trade-off with competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped music—is signaled early but lacks opposition or complication. The "guardian of the secret" (fear) never resists on the page; the Locksmith's method proceeds without setback, adaptation, or visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs (the lattice wavers under humming), but no option narrows, no trade-off emerges, and the resolution arrives without the protagonist risking or losing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) is signaled early and tightens when the violent light fracture presents an anomaly after thirty years of predictable shimmer. The escalation is textural/accumulative: observation intensifies to action when nostalgia "washed over him with the force of a tidal wave." The protagonist's choice to break his observational rule forecloses the path of passive scholarship, with the cost legible in the final lines—decades of work are reframed as "finally beginning." One clear pressure point where habit confronts need.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reversible exile and the path home. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael completes the annotated map, forcing Elara's decision. Her agency is renunciation with visible cost—staying in exile to build strength rather than risking premature return. The tea-reading ritual escalates pressure through Kael's agitation and backward retreat. The cost of staying versus the cost of leaving unprepared is made tangible through the trapped shadow and Kael's decades of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled early and coheres through to restoration. Pressure tightens once: the greyness progresses, Elian recognizes the timeframe, executes the ritual without complication, and succeeds. No reversal or failed attempt tests his commitment; the seed absorbs essence on first contact, and vibrancy spreads instantly. Agency is visible in the ritual's design (weaving between worlds, infusing essence) but the outcome feels scripted rather than earned through adaptation. The single deepening (recognizing the precise moment) is sufficient under the Causal lens, but cost clarity is thin—Elian feels "the steady rhythm of a world restored" without visible sacrifice or foreclosed future.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—ground restless spirits before "their agony unraveled creation itself"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when the narrator selects "a knot no bigger than my thumb, impossibly tight," and the unrest "sharpens" as the needle enters. The knot's resistance ("holding its ancient tension") creates a micro-reversal before the final loosening, which eases the sanctuary's pressure. Agency is clear: the narrator's careful technique ("not forcing...but teasing") drives the turn. Cost is visible in "familiar exhaustion" and the transfer of the enormous remaining task to Kaelen. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—interpreting the silence of the torn map—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the 1958 and 1993 footage comparison reveals the subtle lichen disruption, forcing Elara to choose between restoration and acknowledgment. The final annotation forecloses the path of repair, a visible on-page cost that reweights her framing task. No antagonist is needed; the mystery itself generates escalation. One tightening point is sufficient at this length and fits the accumulative/causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and drives the investigation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the strongbox yields the snow globe and note, narrowing the narrator's interpretive frame and forcing a choice about possession versus release. The final decision (leave the globe, write a note, release grief) enacts visible cost: the narrator relinquishes the artifact and accepts the impermanence it represents. Agency is clear; coincidence complicates (sonar discovery) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—giving Lyra recognition in her bodiless existence—is signaled early and drives the single ritual beat. The lightning-to-thunder window provides a ticking clock, and Elian's focused haste creates local urgency. The climax (the graffiti blazes, mist forms the flower, melody plays) delivers a meaningful deepening: her reply proves the communion works. However, the cost is told rather than shown—"this communion was temporary" is a claim, not a forfeited path. No visible trade-off or altered tactic emerges; success arrives on schedule without a pivot or sacrifice that would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the diary to honor the Captain's memory and find hidden joy. The causal chain tightens once—chime at third floor → light enters → Kael uses goggles → text resolves → hidden sketch discovered → mission accomplished—with the sketch discovery reweighting all prior anguish. The escalation is modest (single reversal) but sufficient for this length, driven by Kael's agency (lifting goggles, unfolding vellum). Cost is visible: he now carries a secret he must protect, and his detachment forecloses fuller connection. No antagonist needed; the encrypted diary supplies resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating observations: tendrils, the Great Sadness, and finally the noctilucent proof. Each sighting narrows interpretive options until the fractal match forecloses doubt. The protagonist's agency is attention and pattern-recognition under an Accumulative lens; no antagonist is required. The final peace and cessation of recording represent a visible cost (the quest ends) and a choice to accept proof rather than continue searching. Escalation operates through density increase and cadence shift (the noctilucent passage is longer, more charged) rather than external conflict, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (mirror the sky inside walls) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the lock mechanism delays resolution while the building groans, narrowing time. Agency is present in the fingertip decoding and placement, but the whispered duty reduces ownership. The final act (pressing stone to heartwood) reweights the ambition with visible cost—sanctuary achieved as destruction looms—but the stone's appearance is a given, not a trade-off Elara wrestles. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through sensory and temporal density rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—chart the stranded luminance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through a clear sequence: initial observation fails → frustration prods retreat → hopscotch insight narrows method → starlings become legible → luminance emerges. One meaningful deepening: the realization that "starlings were not dancing randomly" reweights the task from passive waiting to active pattern-reading. Agency is decision-driven (kneel, cross-reference, sketch furiously, follow the final pattern). The escalation feels more revelatory than agonistic; Elias's agency is observational rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. A stronger on-page price—what he risks or loses by committing to this method—would elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the Orrery—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hall of mirrors' blinding light forces Elara to invent a shadow-eclipse, narrowing her options and raising the cost of hesitation. Agency is present in the uncapping and gear selection. However, no live opposing force tests her resolve; the obstacle is environmental rather than adaptive. The resolution feels automatic once she understands the shadow principle—no visible trade-off or secondary loss alters her tactics after the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (escape via nebula) is signaled early, but pressure remains flat—each message is followed without doubt or competing option. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows choices; the team obeys instructions in sequence. The climb introduces physical difficulty (wind, height) but no cost that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off among the family. Kaelen's grumble is deflated in the same beat, and Anya's success feels inevitable rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—granting peace to the past—is signaled early and pursued without deviation. Pressure accumulates through the textural deepening of the lullaby's translation and the physical cost of Elias pouring his essence into the pattern. However, there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options; the ritual proceeds as intended from start to finish, with success assured. The cost (his dissolution) is visible and charges the ending, but the lack of complication or forced trade-off keeps escalation smooth rather than tested. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lullaby ripples backward and we see its effects ("unexpected kindness"), sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (save the traveler before frost/birds kill them) is signaled immediately by the horn call. One clear tightening: frost arrival accelerates pressure ("before the night frost formed") and the birds' erratic aggression raises cost. Agency is protagonist-driven: Elias chooses to assemble and activate despite his weariness. The resolution is earned—beacon disables birds, path glows, traveler escapes—but the cost is visible: the nut is "cracked and hollow," one-use spent, and Elias remains bound. The price (tool consumed, curse endures) forecloses an easier path and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled in paragraph two and remains coherent. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accrues through observations that narrow Aris's framing: milkweed (absence), braided river (divergence as complexity), foam (impermanent patterns). The insight constitutes a meaningful deepening rather than a reversal. Agency is present as attentional endurance (choosing to sit, watch, deconstruct foam) that forecloses the frame of "broken chain." Cost is conceptual—accepting that he cannot reclaim the old path—but remains somewhat abstract. No on-page antagonist or tactical obstacle; the design relies on internal reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: Elian's need to find where stories begin. The escalation operates through accumulative density—measuring absences, converging fragments into a map—then one decisive deepening when he realizes origin is an act, not a place. The incision forecloses passive seeking with visible cost (wounding perfection), and the library's tremor signals reweighting. Agency is clear in the final choice, though the story lacks a second reversal or tightening obstacle; the path from realization to action is direct.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—escaping the daily anvil of others' grief—is clear and tightens when the pavilion's "collective sorrow" threatens to "pulverize his bones." Kaelen's choice to subsume rather than flee is agency-driven and narrows his options (he becomes "terrifyingly smooth," losing the brittle parts). The Warlord's arrival and Kaelen's touch test the transformation with visible proof. One gap: the leap from tasting one fossil to deciding to excavate and enter the pavilion could show more hesitation or trade-off in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore network harmony before communal spirit fractures. One meaningful tightening occurs when the weight trembles violently and Elias must make an empathetically decisive adjustment at the critical moment. The resolution is earned by his action (nudging the dial, layering languages), and cost appears in his exhaustion and the acknowledgment that "the work was never truly finished." Under a situational lens, pressure coheres. However, the peak choice feels more technical than morally charged—there's no genuine dilemma or competing goods, just skilled execution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving an abandoned dream by modifying her own mind—is signaled early and tightens once: she selects the composer's dream, endures the torrent, and stabilizes the feedback loop, narrowing options (success or self-dissolution). The "entangled memories fought back" moment raises cost, and the tear at the end makes the price visible. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length under the Causal lens. Agency is clear (her decision to focus, her will to modify her cortex), and coincidence does not resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: prevent the intellectual plague by retrieving forgotten combinations. The Inversion provides external pressure and a ticking clock; gravity's reversion forces the scramble, narrowing options. Agency is clear—Kael's perceptual alignment enables the discovery—but the escalation is more environmental than driven by his choices compounding prior costs. The obsidian-wall realization is a strong turn, yet it arrives without a prior failed attempt or visible trade-off that would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: release a symphony from the grove. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the Old One's cracks are "a score...a map of its resonant soul"—this narrows her method from imposing melody to releasing stored history. She moves tree to tree, each touch producing a note that accumulates pressure. Yet the accumulation is mechanical; no reversal or trade-off appears. The final harmony "filled the hollow space" without showing what Elara risked or lost to achieve it. Escalation reads as additive rather than cost-driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—discover beauty/logic in chaos—is signaled early and tightens through the silence-charting methodology with one meaningful deepening when the pattern emerges. Agency is attention and endurance that foreclosures his exile-as-punishment reading, visible in the stone release and scholar reframing. The magnetic alignment provides external pressure; his precise focus and awe-tear earn the shift. Cost is legible: exile sadness persists but harmonizes, and the dented stone becomes a marker rather than scar. Under Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase to cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the clasp to recover its emotional frequency—is signaled early and tightened by the fireworks countdown ("Time was running out"). Elias's pivot from machine to memory at the climax demonstrates protagonist agency under the causal lens. The cost remains conceptual rather than visceral: no foreclosed path is dramatized (he could have walked away, continued machine-only tuning, or opened the diary later), and the final smile undercuts urgency, preventing full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    One dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tested when the new winds arrive with sensory overload. The tightening is the protagonist's active choice to anchor on the seed's scent rather than flee, narrowing options with visible cost (pain behind her eyes, immense urge to block it all). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible ("profound calm settled...deeper than any she had felt before"). No multiple reversals required at this length; one meaningful deepening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (find resilience source to save orchards) is clear and urgent. The gravity-inversion window provides a ticking clock, and the skiff chase as gravity returns tightens pressure. However, the escalation is environmental (time running out) rather than driven by Elara's agency or a dilemma; she executes the plan without setback or tough choice. The crystal-shearing succeeds on first attempt with no visible price—no tool failure, no need to leave something behind, no injury or foreclosed future option that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: understand the physics of the silence (signaled in paragraph 4). Escalation proceeds through data accumulation → patch discovery → re-calibrated survey → nexus identification → full sequence reconstruction. The patch functions as a meaningful reversal that narrows options and reweights the investigation from ground to sky. Agency is decision and attention under pressure; the cost—standing alone with predictive knowledge but no one to save—lands on the page in the final beat. One meaningful tightening (convergence on the nexus) with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"to certify wonder as essential"—is declared but never opposed on the page. No obstacle challenges Kael's performance; the ritual proceeds without error, trade-off, or visible cost. The tremor-as-cue and the sculptor's progress arrive as coincidence, not as dramatized pressure that forces Kael to adapt tactics. The ending asserts global renewal without showing a single moment where Kael's agency forecloses an option or pays a price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (harvesting insight from failure) is signaled in paragraph one and drives every beat. The accumulative pressure tightens through physical ritual (arranging wood) to metaphysical risk (playing the flute) to the crushing insight. Agency is enacted through renunciation and reframing: treating the flute "not with the reverence of a keeper, but with the grim focus of a dissector," then discovering he "had treated the flute like a hammer when it was meant to be a needle and thread." Cost is visible: he gains truth but explicitly not "forgiveness" or "redemption," and the final image of the silent flute conveys foreclosed possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Anya seeks to "unmake a feeling"; Elias seeks its mathematics. The press ritual tightens once, transposing her grief into cold geometry and yielding the card. That single deepening narrows Anya's options (she cannot unsee the shape of her sorrow) and forecloses emotional simplicity. The cost is legible—disorientation, the unbearable weight "recontextualized" but not vanished. One meaningful turn suffices under the Accumulative lens; Elias's agency drives the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: deliver the pendant without succumbing to anxiety. The aurora's pulse and pendant's hum create one meaningful tightening—Kael witnesses phantoms and Elara's memory, which reweights his understanding. However, escalation is textural rather than decision-driven; the mystical event happens *to* him, and his agency is limited to watching and then walking forward with new understanding. The cost is conceptual (abandoning the desire for routine) but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions to preserve her memory—is signaled early and deepens when the prism broadcasts mechanical failure instead of love. The "perfect confluence of elements" tightens pressure into one experimental beat. Agency is clear: Elias positions the prism, communes, and interprets the result; the revelation is forced by his own method. The cost is legible and immediate: his "beautiful lie" is "proven horribly, clinically correct," and he sinks to his knees holding a heavier prism. One meaningful turn narrows all options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—carrying the message across impossible distance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the cost structure: each thread erases a memory, and the final act (placing the bead, weaving the locking threads) forecloses her last connection with visible cost. The faltering moment ("the sudden, sharp void where his name used to be") provides one tightening, though the escalation is more density-increase than a reversal that forces a trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—planetary survival via bartered healing—is signaled early and tightens through the descent and ritual. Agency is clear: Elian chooses to give irreplaceable memories, a decision that forecloses his past with visible cost. The geode's pulse and arch's blue glow provide on-page reversal (death-sound to murmur, crumbling to solid grace). Escalation is causal and the price (hollowed-out sensory past) is unmistakable, meeting the high-band requirement for felt cost that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering the truth about Elara's death—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens when Kael sees the console warnings and realizes the resonance cascade origin. The escalation is causal: the energy is about to peak again, forcing immediate action. His redirect choice narrows options (he cannot save her, only prevent recurrence) with visible cost—the visions collapse, leaving only "quiet, dusty dark." The price is felt and the action is protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect the light and keeper—is signaled early and tightens when the beam vanishes. The storm crossing and lamp repair are both protagonist-driven escalations that narrow options. The logbook discovery is a micro turn that reconfigures the goal (protect light, not keeper) with felt cost. The stone-circle choice at the end forecloses the relationship. One visible price: the keeper is gone, and Silas's fragile intimacy ends. The escalation is causal and the cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—steering the cosmic storm—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation reads as intensification of the ritual (adjusting levers, wick glowing white-hot, tower shuddering) rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off that alters tactics. The storm passes without Kaelan making a consequential choice; the "unfamiliar quality" in the dawn is noticed, not earned through agency, leaving cost implied rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kaelen shifts from pigment study to tracking light behavior, narrowing his method. The final approach with the wing constitutes agency, but no live option is foreclosed; the woman departs freely and Kaelen is left with understanding, not a trade-off or visible price. Escalation reads as density increase (weeks turning into a season, repeated observations) rather than a tightening that forces a difficult choice, meeting the Accumulative lens minimum but not the 8.0+ gate requiring a felt cost that charges tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Aris seeks to witness and archive tree sorrow, a quiet but consistent pressure. The tink of the crystallized shard in the corridor provides a micro-complication that triggers the night's key task. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the sorrow-meter spikes to an unprecedented level, then the storm's crescendo and the moonlight shaft deepen the transformation. The final mosaic placement enacts agency—he chooses to archive rather than heal—with the cost that his work is perpetual and he remains a custodian, not a savior. The lack of overt conflict or antagonist fits the lens; pressure accumulates through process and the shard's resistance to easy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—saving the realm via song—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: gathering fragments into the whole Canticle. However, escalation is thin; each plant-tending moment yields a fragment with no resistance, complication, or false path. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned by protagonist struggle. The climax is a performance, not a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres but does not deepen meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding the flawed logic behind his refusal, signaled early. The piece tightens when Elara's arrival forces Elias to enact "staying while leaving," which reframes his empathy from overwhelming storm to "clear lens." The smoothing of the invitation is an endurance-plus-renunciation act with visible cost: he acknowledges folly without reversing the decision. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the realization that "shelter had to be empty" was the mistake) is sufficient. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (cultivating life against erasure) is signaled early and tested in the encounter. The patrolman's arrival tightens options—Elara must "uncloak" her purpose—and her choice to explain rather than flee, then offer the bread, narrows the tactical field with agency. The nod and departure constitute a micro-reversal that reweights her solitary work without resolving the larger decay. Cost is visible: she stands "alone in the cold" but now "seen," a trade-off between isolation and validation that forecloses simple triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve the vow's essence before it vanishes. Pressure tightens through the resonator sequence: the projection frays, frequencies scatter, Kaelen must find the carrier wave against a "failing heartbeat" of light. The final flare—"brilliant, defiant nova"—forces his desperate stab at the console, a micro-turn with visible cost (the slide dies, becomes "inert"). Agency is clear: his invention and skill enable the capture, and the choice to persist charges the closure (he prepares for "the next day" despite the encroaching void). Cost is legible: each saved vow deepens his solitude, and the city's strangers embody the loss. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (stop the fob sale to protect her family's ecosystem) is signaled early and sustained. Three escalating attempts (chaos, appeal to Boro, bribe) each narrow options with on-page failures, forcing the final lie—a choice that trades truth for survival and forecloses the path of honest persuasion. The lie's success depends on Elara's specific knowledge (grandfather's flaw detail) and Silas's panic, making it an earned reversal. Cost is visible: she breaks the very thing she came to record (trust) and weaponizes her family legacy. The tightening is decisive and shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving the emergent compass hypothesis—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification (taste changes, converging carriers, aurora descent) and reaches a clear tightening when the storms merge and vanish, silencing the carriers' internal compasses. The cost is conceptual and legible: Elara's neat-code ambition is relinquished for acceptance of an organic phenomenon beyond her control. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, which fits the design. However, Elara's agency at the peak is passive observation rather than a decision that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (uncork suppressed creativity) is signaled early and remains coherent. The lock-opening sequence is a meaningful tightening driven by protagonist agency: Elias must decode the painting (azure→rose→gold→violet) and manipulate the damaged tumbler mechanism with "charcoal-fingered delicacy." The reversal—Anya hid not a masterpiece but tools he'd only be worthy of after learning to see—reweights prior material. Cost is visible: years of "bankrupt artist" servitude, the broken lock monument to youthful impatience, and the tear through dust. No coincidence resolves; the insight and safecracking are his. One slight softness: the patron-laughter trigger could apply more immediate pressure on the page before the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—find where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens once when Elian realizes the seeds require sincerity as substrate. The vault discovery meaningfully narrows options: he shifts from passive calligrapher to active cultivator. However, no live opposition or trade-off complicates his descent; the door opens perfectly, and no cost is dramatized during the reconstruction weeks. The final planting carries clear agency and visible commitment, but the escalation path lacks a second reversal or friction point.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the fading truth of oceanic joy—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: each carved facet and tuned chime adds complexity until the wind triggers the full symphony. The sculpture's self-destruction provides on-page cost (the vessel vanishes), and Elian's days of silent work demonstrate endurance. However, no live option is foreclosed for Elian himself; the wind's convenient arrival at the "right moment" and the sculpture's successful performance lack a tactical trade-off or complication that would force him to adapt mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: resolve the inner static to become more than a machine. The magnetic shift provides a live ticking constraint that masks the energy surge. One meaningful escalation: the chaos resists compression, threatening to fragment the protagonist's consciousness, before being overcome via Elara's counter-frequency. The final cost is legible—leaving the perfect garden for the uncertain real—and the protagonist's agency (channeling power, interface rewriting) drives the turn. No coincidental rescue; the escape is earned through protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unlock the mailbox before management drills it—is signaled early and creates a ticking social pressure. The tightening occurs when Elias reinterprets the locket's pattern as the key, narrowing the path from brute force to remembrance. However, the escalation relies on accumulating clues rather than Elias's agency under conflicting pressure; he gathers testimony without visible trade-offs or failed attempts. The resolution feels more like a riddle solved than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with cost, and the "drill threat" evaporates off-page rather than forcing a visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating her mother's consciousness from the lab's core—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the recursive cipher resists conventional attack, forcing the pivot to dance, then to randomness. The dice roll narrows options (she must surrender control) and the final cost is clear: accepting that "not all systems can be controlled." Agency is decision and renunciation, earning the closure without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    One dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The tightening occurs when Silas locates the gravity pocket via coffee grounds, then reaches into it; the reversal is the pocket's dissipation after he retrieves only a fragment, forcing him to accept incremental recovery. The cost is visible: he gains proof but not restoration, and the path forward is now an endless series of solitary retrievals. Agency is clear—his ritual, his reach—and coincidence (the whale's influence) complicates rather than resolves. The escalation is protagonist-driven under the Causal lens. No antagonist is needed; the fluctuating pockets and Elara's absence supply sufficient pressure. One meaningful deepening (proof → hope) narrows options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before chaos spreads—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through one continuous ritual action (mapping silence, channeling energy, swallowing whispers) without a reversal or complication that tests Elara's commitment. The whispers "falter" and "thin" smoothly; no credible friction forces a trade-off. The ending lands on "work done" without showing what she gave up or what remains at risk beyond the abstract "until…again" frame, leaving escalation and cost clarity under the Accumulative lens incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Clara's need to understand building language and Elias's true nature—signals early and tightens when the seal makes whispers "louder, more distinct." The rooftop invitation is a calculated escalation: she "knew he would not answer direct questions within the confines of his apartment," forcing the confrontation into open space. The cost is legible: she trades the "silent sanctuary of denial" for truth, and Elias's revelation that "the lies had been a necessary fiction" reweights their entire relationship. Agency is decision-driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the quarantined memory to achieve true independence—is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: Elian can pull back to "safe, empty isolation" or push through to wholeness, and he chooses the latter with visible cost (experiencing the trauma). The escalation is driven by his agency under a causal lens. Minor weakness: the opposition is largely internal and abstract; no external complication arises to test his resolve mid-process, flattening the pressure curve slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—end the unwinnable war by unlocking the Covenant without shattering it—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the thorn's descent and the minuscule tail addition narrow all future options from perpetual vendetta to honorable void. Agency is decision and endurance (years of study, steadying breath, surgeon's focus) that forecloses the war path with visible cost (trembling, profound peace, walking out). The protagonist's prior study and discovery of the glyph earn the closure beat; no coincidence resolves. Escalation operates under the causal lens: preparation → execution → semantic shift → release. The price (trembling, solitary treason, weight of kingdom's future) is unmistakable on the page and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—learning why some echo and others fade—is signaled in paragraph one and drives each beat. Pressure accumulates through progressive disclosure: each echo and whisper tightens understanding, and the final chamber forces harmonic alignment to complete the seashell. The story delivers one meaningful deepening when Lyra realizes echoes are "anchors… preventing pure silence," which narrows her purpose from knowledge-seeker to song-finisher. Agency is present in her choice to sing acceptance rather than question, though the resolution hinges more on understanding than a high-cost trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing the truth that binds the boy and the man—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through dream fragments, then tightens when Elara creates the shared dreamscape and projects contradictory evidence. The man's dissolving facade and the boy's smile constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral; Elara's agency is never tested by genuine opposition or risk of failure, and the resolution unfolds without visible sacrifice or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake (appreciating and connecting to hidden patterns) is signaled early and tightens through the whistle attempt. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, navigate by moon paths, and whistle into the pattern. The fireflies' indifference creates a micro-turn that forces acceptance—a meaningful deepening that narrows options (he cannot control the pattern, only participate). Cost is visible: his audacious attempt yields only a brief, illusory response, yet the smile and repricing show he has renounced mastery for connection. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres through the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake (excavate truth from superstition) drives the investigation with consistent pressure. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening: Kaelen must intuit the final step—shifting from looking *through* the diamond to using it to *focus* light—which narrows options and demonstrates agency under the causal lens. The cost is legible: three days of methodical work, the climb, and the professional risk of testing an incomplete hypothesis. No false reversals; the escalation proceeds through earned causality (observation → research → application). The resolution belongs entirely to Kaelen's choices, with coincidence absent from the solving mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (shape a new dawn) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Escalation occurs: first lonely interpretation, then growing flock, then forced choice between two shadows. However, the climactic reversal is triggered by the chest's convenient unlocking rather than protagonist agency—Elian does not choose to open it through prior effort or cost. The final broadcast rejects both options, which is a stance, but the map that enables this third way was not earned by his prior tactics. One meaningful tightening is present (the Great Storm forcing his hand) but cost clarity is muddied by the convenient solve.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—giving the silent music box a new song—is signaled at discovery and sustained through collection to performance. One meaningful tightening occurs when he decides not to repair but to "sweeten its profound and empty quiet," narrowing his options to composition. The accumulative pressure builds through the gathering sequence, each jar a note in his eulogy. However, no live opposition tests his commitment; the work proceeds smoothly without sacrifice or foreclosed alternatives, leaving the cost more aesthetic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protect the Siren's Heart from the invasive frequency—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One clear tightening: the frequencies lock in a "violent shriek" that forces Elara's final "willed push" to subsume the threat, narrowing options to succeed-or-catastrophic-failure. Agency is present but constrained: Elara enacts a plan with minimal improvisation, and no live alternative or competing good complicates her choice. The cost is physical exhaustion rather than a moral trade-off or foreclosed relationship, keeping the score below 7.5. Escalation is smooth but lacks a reversal or deepening that would raise the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake signaled early: sever the Authority's control at the moment of gravitational weakness. One meaningful tightening when the scrying bowl trembles and Kaelen sends the coded pulse—protagonist agency drives the turn. The cost is legible: generations of patient waiting and the risk of acting on a single calculated moment. The wild impatience versus disciplined observation creates internal pressure throughout. Minor limit: the resistance cell's success happens off-page, diluting the immediate price Kaelen pays beyond the emotional closure of her internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to assert professional autonomy against Fletcher's dismissive control—is signaled early and tightens when he finds the notebook, reframing the death and forcing a choice. The final decision to include full context is agency with visible cost (professional defiance). The escalation is meaningful but singular: one discovery → one decision. Finch's obsession provides thematic weight but is not a live antagonist; the conflict remains internal and procedural, which fits the lens but limits higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Arthur's search for understanding ("to turn an apology into action"). The clockwork heart introduces immediate pressure; Elias's diagnosis ("a lockbox... show them where the light can get in") narrows Arthur's options and reweights his pastoral role. The tightening is meaningful: Arthur moves from offering absolution to seeking cracks. Cost is visible in his acknowledgment of failure ("the old, useless weight of his apology") and his decision to leave the heart with Elias, foreclosing the path of mechanical repair. Agency is clear in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—prove the Yearning Algorithm's command and survive—is signaled early and escalates through the causal sequence: glyph recognition → wing redesign → launch → free-fall → actuator pull. The reversal at "He was falling" narrows options to death or the untested wing; pulling the actuator is protagonist agency under maximum pressure. The cost is visible: "He couldn't tell a soul, but the bell had been rung"—success is earned but lonely, and the gamble with death is on the page. The glider "stopped falling" is a decisive physical change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where Julian's deleted files went—is signaled in paragraph one and remains coherent throughout. Pressure tightens when the "7, 11, 23" pattern emerges, converting aimless search into targeted hunt. The Kael interruption is the key escalation beat: his arrival in a sector he shouldn't occupy forces the lie, and her "heart hammered against her ribs" registers the visceral cost of continuing. The final act (clicking 'forward') is pure protagonist agency under accumulated pressure, and it forecloses a return path—Julian's testimony will expose AetherNet, ending Elara's sanctuary access. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible on the page: "They went where inconvenient truths were hidden" crystallizes the price of her discovery. The piece does not require multiple reversals; the single turn (from searcher to whistleblower by proxy) is earned by prior causality and Julian's embedded map.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—community cohesion versus fracture—is signaled immediately and tightens through Kael's investigation to the revelatory speech that reweights the accusation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the visions expose dual fears (Jorn's secrecy, Mara's trauma), narrowing options to truth-telling. The cost is legible: Mara's anger converts to "weary understanding," and the breach begins to heal with a "shuddering sigh." Agency rests with Kael's choice to intervene and speak, though Mara and Jorn remain more reactive than active.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: learn the sound of approaching endings before her own clinic appointment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ice-calving sound provides the answer, narrowing her options (her work here is done) and foreclosing the search with visible cost (the profound calm that replaces the taut wire of impatience). Agency is attention that discovers and reweights meaning. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as cadence shift and density break at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: achieving peace with the burned relationship. The tightening occurs when his gaze at the mismatched vines triggers the parallel to his own love—intensity versus need for space—and he reinterprets the fire as "preservation" rather than spite. Agency is internal but foreclosed: he cannot reclaim the relationship, only reframe it, and that renunciation carries visible cost (solitude, the fragility of memory). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; pressure coheres through reflection anchored in present observation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserve pure wisdom before it dissolves—is signaled early and sustained. The opening disciple's distortion serves as catalyst, and Cael's departure and descent meaningfully tighten options (he must act now, alone). The ritual sequence escalates through each step (find marker, spiral, activate parapet, consecrate void), culminating in the sphere absorbing the echo. Agency is clear: Kael's choice to push the undiluted truth into the clearing forecloses all paths of debate with visible cost (isolation, the world's ignorance). One substantive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The story accumulates material (photographs, seasons, vines) rather than escalating pressure; Elias faces no reversal, no choice that narrows options, no trade-off. Placing the final photograph feels inevitable rather than hard-won. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, and the spiral's completion does reweight the mosaic, but the absence of visible cost or agency at closure keeps the score in mid-band. No antagonist or complication tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding the pattern of growth) is signaled in paragraph one and sustained. The crystal's discovery introduces a reversal: what seemed "poignantly obsolete" becomes vital through the acoustic archive. Weeks of charting fractured sequences represent protagonist agency and escalation under the accumulative lens—cadence builds from passive curating to active pattern-recognition. The final choice (testify rather than publish) narrows options with felt cost: he relinquishes academic closure to bear witness. One meaningful tightening is present and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: capture the sound of growing older at the nexus point tonight. The escalation works under the Accumulative lens: forgetting intensifies from paragraph one through the climax, narrowing his options from confident path-following to desperate improvisation. The final turn—drawing a simple circle instead of the lost sigil—is protagonist-driven with visible cost: he abandons his life's work (possession/capture) for fleeting presence. The hum "cresting" and immediately receding makes the price unmistakable. One solid tightening through memory erosion that forecloses the original goal, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (save the station/harness the ephemeral) is signaled early and tightens through escalating vibrations, the hairline crack, and the nanosecond alignment demand. Elias's agency drives the resolution through his decision to sacrifice the lens, and the cost is visible: he loses the "most perfect vessel" for his memory. One meaningful tightening occurs when Hima declares dampening won't work, forcing restructure over repair. The alignment task under violent crescendo narrows options with genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—"execute a flawless goodbye"—is signaled early and drives Elara's call to Lena, the tea preparation, and the record playing. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena arrives hesitant and the music becomes the bridge, narrowing the path to the hand-clasp and tear. The cost is Mr. Aris's death with reunion achieved, but Elara's agency never faces a trade-off or visible price on her side; the escalation is atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: find where shadows go at noon. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara completes the key sequence and the automaton projects the answer, narrowing uncertainty into a precise visual proof. Agency is present (she relearns the rune, aligns the key), but the path from study to solution is linear without a reversal or trade-off. The cost is conceptual (weeks of obsessive work, relearning the universe's grammar) and legible, but there is no on-page moment where she risks failure or must choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias must reconcile his dismissal of the supernatural with mounting evidence. The tooth discovery provides one decisive tightening that narrows options—he "could no longer deny the grate of this new reality." Agency is present: his choice to chart the constellation is renunciation (of old certainty) with visible cost. The escalation reads smoothly under the causal lens. No second reversal is required at this length, but the single pressure point is meaningful and protagonist-driven, with cost legible in his acceptance of a "lifetime" of self-forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and sustained. The polishing work provides a single meaningful tightening as the glass transforms from opaque to luminescent, but no live opposition tests her effort—no risk of failure, no scarcity of time or material, no competing need. The twilight's arrival feels coincidental rather than a consequence of her agency, and the resolution (the glass glows) lacks a visible price or trade-off. One tightening deepens her focus, yet escalation under the Accumulative lens remains gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elara's effort to help Kaelen see himself as changeable rather than fossilized. The stake tightens through observation (tracking the drip pattern for days) and culminates in the proffering gesture that forecloses her own attachment to permanence. The water/amber contrast creates a meaningful choice with felt cost. Slight deduction for Kaelen's largely passive reception; his internal resistance is shown but not tested through counter-moves, which would have sharpened the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling creative integrity with past compromise—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the parade of abandoned characters, each a reminder of sacrifice, until Elias's burial of the shell reweights his relationship to them from author to keeper. The act forecloses resurrection (visible cost: the shell, his "untarnished hope") and the spectral figures' release confirms the shift. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs at the burial, though the cameos risk feeling repetitive without sharper escalation. Agency is renunciation with on-page consequence (the easing current, the glowing figures).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance and remedy to the listless village—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Elian must "coax the life" from the vine through precise sonic tuning; his adjustment of a dissonant note demonstrates agency that narrows options (wrong note would fail the ritual). The alignment window ("one fleeting seam in the year") creates temporal constraint. However, escalation is single-beat: once the song succeeds, the vine responds "instantly" and the climax unfolds without complication or reversal. The cost is conceptual (must teach others) rather than a visible trade-off or loss that alters his immediate options.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating a frightened child's heartbeat into a guiding map—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a density increase: listening → arranging → pouring starlight → sealing → releasing. The paper's transformation from "wild pulse to steady beacon" narrows options and deepens meaning. Minor cap: no on-page reversal or tightening choice that forecloses a path; Kaelen's actions are uninterrupted and inevitable, with cost implied rather than dramatized as friction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (restore the timer to harvest echoes) is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through iterative observation ("days bled into weeks"), but the escalation reads as summary rather than a tightening choice or reversal that narrows options. The resolution—fitting the final component and nudging the lever—arrives without visible cost or trade-off; success feels inevitable rather than earned by on-page agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (collect burdens, give them final home) and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the farmer's grief arrives, Kaelen performs the ritual, and the mosaic deepens. The single meaningful tightening is the alignment and calcification process, which narrows options (the wisp must be oriented properly or remain chaotic). Cost is conceptual (shingled hush grows heavier, Kaelen remains kneeling, waiting for the next weight) but visible on the page. No protagonist decision alters tactics mid-scene; the ritual unfolds without complication or reversal, capping scores below 8.0. Agency is endurance (Earned Stasis) with cost, but escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to "harvest lessons from loss" and "contain him...a single, essential piece." The memory of Leo and the cub provides one meaningful deepening that changes Elara's understanding—"control wasn't about dominance; it was about presence"—and narrows her carving intent. The kettle's crescendo tightens temporally, forcing the first cut at the climax of sound. Cost is legible: she carves "not the outline of a lion or a man's face, but...an arc of profound stillness," foreclosing literal representation in favor of abstraction. No antagonist or secondary pressure; escalation is internal and accumulative under the chosen lens, fitting the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (negotiate with ghost via collected echoes) is signaled early and tightens when Kael finds "the right fragment, not an overheard story, but his own." The confession—"It was my fault"—narrows options from bargaining to acceptance with visible cost: he pockets the wheel as "accepted past," foreclosing the exculpatory loop. Agency is renunciation that forecloses a path. One small artifact: "the regret was not a weight anymore, but a release" tells the emotional shift rather than letting the pocket-gesture and stillness do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in failed infrastructure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the sextant coordinates match the hidden grid. Her agency drives all turns: she chooses to investigate, to repurpose carnival equipment, to complete the circuit. The activation attempt carries visible risk of failure ("rational disappointment"), and success reweights her philosophical question with concrete discovery. One meaningful escalation suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—signals early and tightens through the physical act of bearing the coffer, kneeling, and arranging the bells. The golden ray crystallizes the choice with felt cost: he leaves the bells behind, "his heart no longer at war with the silence." Agency is renunciation with visible forfeiture (empty hands, dream externalized). The stake is singular and coherent under the accumulative lens, though the lack of external complication or secondary pressure keeps escalation modest for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming his grandfather's reputation by finding proof of the substituted plans—is clear from the opening and escalates through the physical struggle to retrieve the lockbox. The grappling-hook sequence provides concrete escalation: fruitless casts, then the "dead, unyielding weight of iron," then the arduous haul that thud through the punt's frame. The journal revelation decisively narrows options (the grandfather chose disgrace to protect family) and the final epiphany about the sundial reweights all prior material. One missed opportunity: a single earlier complication—resistance from the silt, a near-loss of the box—would have sharpened the pressure curve and pushed this firmly into 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve the knot's encoded knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs when the knot shifts from "bewildering complexity" to "sequence, a phrase," narrowing interpretive options. However, escalation is entirely internal and observational—no external opposition, no foreclosed path, no visible trade-off. The "profound oceanic hush" and fog provide atmosphere but no friction. The cost is conceptual (labor, patience) but never dramatized as a sacrifice or renunciation that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen's effort to compose Elara's "explained absence" and advance his cartography of healing—is signaled early and sustained. The projection sequence deepens understanding in one meaningful pass (thread → loom vision → insight → writing), consistent with Accumulative lens expectations. However, escalation is smooth rather than tightened by resistance: no moment where the projection threatens to fail, where Kaelen doubts his reading, or where a tactical choice narrows his options. The final writing is framed as completion rather than struggle. Cost is conceptual (Elara's self-exile, Kaelen's solitary companionship) and legible in the closing image, but Kaelen himself pays no visible on-page price—no stamina drain, no emotional toll that alters his stance, no choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening organic beauty—is signaled early and tightens through assembly, incubation doubt ("Would the rhythmic clicks...create a monster?"), and the hatching moment. The hybrid creature's emergence and song constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights Kaelen's original goal: he must accept a "new, strange, and perhaps more resilient" beauty rather than the pure restoration he sought. The cost is visible in his renunciation of the dream and embodied in the creature's contradictions, though the escalation arc is somewhat smooth rather than sharply reversing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: proving scars can heal, rewriting her father's legacy. The radio call narrows her options (conservatory = the line her father wouldn't cross), and the graft deepens the pressure by requiring her to sacrifice the coin talisman—a visible cost that forecloses her past. The banyan's survival is uncertain, but her act of binding the graft with the red thread is a decisive choice under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: she chooses to sever the coin rather than keep it. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes she needs thread and uses the talisman's. Cost is on the page and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is liberating trapped memories within the narrow celestial window; the geese timer and star alignment create urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the projected colors remain chaotic until Elara rotates the box—her agency (remembering the spiral etching, acting on it) drives the resolution. The cost is years of preparation and the brief, irreversible moment, though the on-page price at closure feels more conceptual than visceral. No antagonist, but the rigid cosmic schedule and the box's dormant mechanics supply clear pressure. The resolution is earned by protagonist action under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of cosmic consumption—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the empathic sonar search and the discovery of the gear, which deepens understanding rather than reversing direction. The final shift (sonar as broadcast) narrows options conceptually: Xylar commits to patient transmission over calculation. However, escalation is contemplative rather than urgent; no on-page cost or trade-off alters Xylar's tactics mid-journey, and the resolution unfolds without a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering collective grief's shape—is signaled early and drives repeated greenhouse returns. One meaningful deepening occurs: storm arrives at migration peak, focus narrows to convergence point, understanding breaks through. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but arrives via external catalyst (storm) rather than protagonist constraint. The final peace and "new understanding" ease pressure without visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed with felt cost, only understanding gained.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring shared balance through ritual absolution—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias confronts "the hardest part of the ritual, the letting go," where his diligent nature conflicts with the need for release; this tightens his choice and forecloses containment. The imagined release over the water functions as a decisive internal act with felt cost: "a small weight lifted, a micro-adjustment." Agency is clear—he performs the penance, adds the mark, enacts the visualization—and the pendulum's descent marks the turn back to continued work. No multi-reversal needed; the single tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early and pursued through decoding. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frayed silver thread completes the pattern, narrowing uncertainty to a specific celestial route. The sovereign case's pulse and subsequent stillness provide a felt shift, though the cost (a future that never arrived) is conceptual rather than a visible price Elias pays. No antagonist or major reversal; pressure accumulates through the ritual itself. The resolution feels inevitable but lacks a live trade-off or forfeited path for Elias himself.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—seed innovation to save the culture versus condemn it to slow extinction—is clear from paragraph two. Pressure tightens through the year of modeling, pruning dead-end futures, isolating the cascading-adaptation path, then crystallizes at the blank vellum. The final beat deepens cost explicitly: "condemn old ways of life, force hardship on a generation." Agency is decision with visible trade-off; the choice to lower the quill forecloses the option of leaving the page blank and accepting slow fade.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forbidden stories against state erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the broadcast resolves and Elias must verify the luminous words, confirming success before delivery. Agency is present (he chooses to transcribe, verify, smuggle), but the piece lacks a live reversal or complication that narrows options under pressure; the process unfolds smoothly without a moment where failure looms or a tactical choice alters the plan. Cost is conceptual (ongoing risk, isolation) rather than a visible trade-off paid on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: Kael's need to contain grief. The ritual sequence tightens through four beats (portrait → mask → kiln → chair), and the final stillness delivers visible cost—"fleeting illusion of peace to hold against the night." Agency is limited: Kael follows Elara's choreography rather than making a foregrounding choice. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than a reversal that narrows options, which fits the lens but keeps tension implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient knowledge against erasure—is signaled early and tested when the girl rejects the cog's meaning. The encounter narrows Silas's options from potential teacher to resigned memory-keeper, a tightening with felt cost (his imagined "seed of truth" finds "barrenness of the soil"). Agency is present in his choice to continue archiving despite futility. One meaningful escalation occurs, though the pressure could be sharpened if the girl's departure imposed a more immediate tactical cost rather than confirming an existing belief.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—achieving choral harmony despite entrenched animosity—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when tonight's failure forces Elias to abandon his additive method; the shift to "subtracting noise" narrows his options and forecloses the prior approach with visible cost (two years of effort deemed "wrong"). The final hum is a crystallization of fragile unity, but the choir's agency is passive—they follow instructions rather than make a hard choice themselves. The cost (generations of hatred momentarily "carved away") is felt, though the rival townships' specifics remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reshaping traumatic cultural memory before the alignment window closes—is signaled early and sustained. Elias's agency drives every pruning choice; each snip is a deliberate edit with visible consequence (thorny offshoot removed, pale leaf cut). The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: chaotic growth → surgical triage → elegant structure → hope distilled. Cost is legible in the irreversible nature of each cut and the weight of propagating new seeds. One clear tightening when the moons separate and growth subsides, narrowing options to the final fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Silas's desire to reintroduce wonder versus sterile efficiency—is signaled early and drives the riddle choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena solves the riddle and her understanding shifts from glitch-hunt to cultural restoration, narrowing her path and foreclosing the pragmatic option. The cost is legible: Silas gives up certainty of outcome and Lena accepts the burden of reawakening a city. However, the escalation is more thematic than pressure-driven; the riddle itself is solved off-page in a single beat without visible struggle, and coincidence (Lena coming to Silas) sets up the conflict rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    One dominant stake is clear: reversing the encroaching sterility. Pressure tightens meaningfully when she escalates to the white cube house ("most desperate attempt"), and the evening-after observation shows causal consequence of her acts. The realization mid-placement narrows her understanding and forecloses the mystical frame with felt cost. Agency is present: her choice to observe rather than intervene again demonstrates renunciation. The man's contemplation of the flamingo and the woman's riot of flowers provide on-page verification that her interventions altered tactics. One credible tightening under an Accumulative lens with visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to execute the poison mission—is clear from the unclipped ampoule forward. The tightening is decisive: each revelation (sanctuary, lung, piracy motive) narrows options until only burial or genocide remain, and Mara chooses burial with visible cost (mission failure, betrayal of surface command). Agency is hers throughout. Small deduction: the escalation compresses all reversals into one cascading passage; distributing one revelation to an earlier beat and forcing an interim micro-choice would have demonstrated protagonist struggle under rising pressure rather than a single cognitive avalanche.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (capture the missed opportunity's texture) is signaled in paragraph two and tested at the rupture. One meaningful tightening: the completed proof narrows options to a single roll, and the paradox forces reality to yield. Agency is decision under pressure (the final toss), and the cost—re-immersion in "agonizingly perfect" regret—forecloses escape while opening iteration. The seven ruptures seamless forever as predicted, delivering visible consequence. No coincidence resolves; protagonist calculation drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: proving strangers remember kindness, signaled early and pursued methodically. The seventh-night illumination tightens pressure—he risks public failure after six nights of solitary work. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: minutes stretch to an hour of silence, doubt sharpens, then the first light answers. Agency is real but passive at closure: Elias broadcasts, the city chooses to respond. The reversal feels earned by the umbrella memory and the visible labor, though the coincidence of so many awake strangers borders convenience. Cost is emotional and reputational (exposing his "desperate wish"), not a forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—survival against encroaching ice and slow extinction—is signaled early and tightens when Alistair sees the stress fractures. The council's resignation raises the cost of inaction. The bread-memory pivot is a micro turn that shifts tactics from despair to collective action, narrowing options to song. The singing scene escalates from "hesitant murmur" to "powerful chorus" with on-page feedback (groans, cracks, trickle). Agency is shared but Alistair guides pitch, making his role active. The resolution is earned by communal effort, though the lack of a failed attempt or mid-song complication keeps the pressure from fully compounding before success.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—stepping beyond fate's design—is signaled early and escalates through assembly, hesitation ("no turning back"), and the decisive lever-pull. The tightening is clear: Elias moves from theoretical reverse-engineering to irrevocable initiation, narrowing his options to erasure or liberation. Cost is visible on the page in the closing lines (lines fading, weight lifting, "terrifying potential"). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency, though the story lacks a complicating reversal or obstacle between assembly and initiation that would test commitment more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defeat Fear by using brokenness as lure—is signaled early and drives each move: following paradoxical notes, descending to the carousel, reaching for the clasp. The reversal at "you must unbosom the break" tightens pressure; unbosoming the void springs the trap when Fear misreads it. Agency is clear: the protagonist's confession and reframing ("it's my anchor") enable the luminance eruption. Cost is conceptual and legible—"a truer, more perfect emptiness"—though the immediate price in future options remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (protect the orchard from the Razor Squall) is clear and pressure escalates through the storm's arrival. However, the resolution feels preordained—Kai's magic works as expected with no visible tradeoff, missed note, or tactical adaptation. The "turning obstacles into instruments" premise delivers competence rather than a choice under competing costs.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the watchers to honor his mother's mission—is clear from the second paragraph. Pressure escalates through one meaningful tightening: Kaelen cracks the light-syntax, plays the melody, and the whistle fractures, triggering the revelation. The map's projection narrows all options to a single horrifying truth, and the cost (extinction, his mother's death, his new impossible burden) is legible on the page. Agency is consistent: his decoding obsession drives every beat, and coincidence (the watchers existing) complicates but does not resolve. No reversal is required under the Accumulative/Causal hybrid lens, and the deepening changes knowledge with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (will Elara surrender the document?) is present throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aris's parallel lands and Elara looks down at the case, seeing it as a "millstone." Cost is visible in Elara's "quiet, resigned click" and the acknowledgment that "difficult work" remains, but the price feels largely deferred rather than paid on the page. Agency tilts toward Aris as persuader; Elara's decision arrives after passive absorption of his argument without on-page friction or counter-move. No reversal complicates the persuasion—Aris speaks, Elara listens, Elara yields—so escalation reads linear rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve the vessel of memory (the inkwell) and complete the ritual of bearing witness. The rogue current provides one meaningful tightening that forces a desperate, embodied choice with visible cost (scraped knuckles, burning lungs). The resolution—clutching the inkwell, sealing the note with "fierce tenderness"—is earned by Elias's prior devotion and the near-loss reweights his solitary mission. Pressure accumulates and coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the external antagonist (water, time) remains abstract rather than adaptive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and tightens when the stamp match reveals theft rather than acquisition. The blackout complicates access (no primary lumens) but does not resolve; Elias's agency (seeking the stamp, physical readjustment to verify) drives the turn. The cost is legible: he commits to solitary, unrecognized labor and forgoes immediate announcement. One meaningful deepening (discovery of erasure) reweights his task with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: transform formless grief into bearable shape. One meaningful deepening: each ascending step plunges Kaelen deeper into memory, threatening to shatter resolve, until gem polishing provides method. The basilica dream revelation tightens—beauty and broken promise crest together, forcing acceptance that grief is part of him. Agency is clear: he chooses pilgrimage, polishes the gem, and makes the first crane fold. Cost is felt (forever-broken promise) and forecloses the path of drowning avoidance. No need for antagonist; pressure coheres through accumulative memory waves.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—locating where unused potential pools after violent loss—is signaled early and sustained. The array failure creates a tightening: limited time to parse aftershock data. The discovery of the resonance signature is a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and gives her hunt a target. The cost is primarily emotional (grief gains trajectory) rather than a visible forfeiture; no live option is foreclosed on the page, but the Charged Poise reconfiguration is legible and the pressure coheres under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure tightens when the drone must pull against "immense weight" with "knuckles white on the controls," a single meaningful escalation that narrows options. However, the resolution arrives without visible cost: no stamina debt, no tool failure, no social or emotional price paid. The pilgrim's gesture provides the method, reducing Elara's agency at the key unlock moment—she executes instructions rather than solving under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens when the driftwood reveals the structured absence rather than simple death. The protagonist's agency drives the ending: his choice to weaponize his own attribute forecloses his prior lucrative path. The cost is legible: a painstaking, dangerous restoration project. One solid reversal (from passive mourning to active memory warfare) narrows options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—executing the exchange without treachery—is clear and tightens through the lockbox reveal and simultaneous unlocking. One meaningful escalation: the moment their eyes meet over the open box, a silent acknowledgment of required trust that narrows options (either proceed or abort). The resolution traces to Elias's decision to honor the protocol, but no live alternative is tested on the page; Kaelen's cooperation is assumed rather than earned through friction. The final freeing of the men carries procedural tension but emotional cost remains oblique—wisdom's "dividend of life" is conceptual payoff more than felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will face the sea or remain chained to land—is signaled early and tightens across the piece. The deepening occurs through layered memory and present sensation, culminating in the deliberate act of stepping off gravel onto sand and holding the compass over water. Agency is clear: his choice to stop walking away forecloses the year-long penance of utility-pole navigation. Cost is visible: he's a broken navigator confronting the source of his failure with no guarantee of redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—kindling empathy—is signaled early and drives the quest. The discovery of the letter provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options (he can no longer seek the past self, only build forward). However, the escalation is primarily revelatory rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; he follows a breadcrumb trail without cost-laden choices during the journey. The final renunciation forecloses backward-seeking with felt cost, but the journey itself lacks a visible price that alters tactics before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reforge the bond beyond death) is signaled early and held throughout. However, the ritual proceeds without reversal or complication: each step advances smoothly from spice-grinding to scent-conjuring to transformation. The scales' acceleration provides physical intensification but not a meaningful narrowing of options—Elian's brief resistance collapses without cost, and the bond's reforging feels assured rather than earned through a choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and drives the quest. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tablecloth-smudge failure propels Elara to the glade. The final renunciation (letting go rather than recovering) narrows options and forecloses the search with on-page cost (cloak shed, new vow traced). The turn from desperate need to profound calm compresses rapidly without intermediate resistance; the realization that lost time is "simply vapor" arrives as insight rather than through a forced trade-off or visible price paid in the moment, slightly softening the escalation's grip.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled in paragraph two and sustained. Pressure accumulates through each photograph, with escalation clear when the final image (her own childhood) threatens to crush her more than any prior attempt. Agency manifests as acceptance and compassion rather than force, aligning with her pacifism and the piece's accumulative lens. The cost is visible: her body pressed to the floor, the ship shuddering, and ultimately the path of solitary vigil foreclosed as the aperture opens and she drifts toward the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate through Kael's agency. The detour and firefly release are sequential actions without meaningful tightening or cost; the volcano's response is an external gift, not a consequence of a difficult choice. The prophecy complicates the scene but resolves through coincidence (the alignment, the carvings, the fireflies) rather than Kael's decision under pressure. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off; the ending reweights the concept but without visible sacrifice or forfeiture by Kael himself.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—seizing fort control during the blackout—is signaled early and Kael's unlock creates one meaningful tightening when the light nodes flicker in unified cadence. Agency is present: Kael's decision to use the quill holder drives the turn. Yet escalation is thin; the unlock succeeds without complication, and the off-page allies' subsequent actions are recounted in summary without visible friction or cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but the lack of a second on-page reversal or visible trade-off (Kael experiences no loss, no tactical adjustment under resistance) keeps pressure from deepening into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the bluff and his patterns from the rising tide—is signaled early and escalates through the vision. The climax is driven by Kael's agency: he chooses to deploy the star dust, a choice with irreversible cost. The wave's arrival and splitting constitute a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces the protagonist's hand. The cost is visible: the star dust is spent, and Kael has crossed a threshold from passive observation to active intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The timer's one-hour countdown creates a visible time constraint, and the ticking rhythm tightens attention until the ping announces the mask's dissolution. The envelope's contents then narrow options: Elias must choose between remaining on the mountain or beginning the journey. The final image (city light through clouds) charges the trade-off between solitude and confrontation. One meaningful deepening; cost is felt in the shift from "furiously tranquil" to honest trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: navigate Elara's philosophical challenge to reach the next stage of their duel. The pressure tightens as the shadow shortens and Kaelen's sequence must match the coded angles in real time. The final thrust at the seam when the shadow touches the marker is a meaningful turn driven by protagonist agency. Cost is felt (the wait consumed, the gambit accepted) but remains more intellectual than visceral—no live option is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: rebuild beauty from rot. One meaningful tightening occurs when the strangers appear—Silas must choose exposure over retreat. His step forward and handing over the poem foreclose solitary safety with visible cost (his caught breath, the "first brick laid"). The Architect persona enables the choice; last month's Reckoner would have cataloged threat. No forced reversals; the accumulative lens supports the single deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: find her before the pathways collapse at nightfall. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency—he decodes the film, translates it into music, and forces the doorway into existence—with a meaningful tightening when "the air before the piano began to shimmer and distort." The cost is visible: he leaves his piano and refuge behind. The agency at closure (stepping through) forecloses the path of staying in the arbor with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—protect cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled immediately and remains coherent throughout. Pressure tightens through a single meaningful deepening: Elara's realization that the dreams form a sequence, which forecloses her empirical approach and forces a leap to faith-based action with visible cost (abandoning her instruments/charts paradigm). The monsoon deadline operates as external pressure, and the final act (singing, planting) is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible—her doubt remains, now integrated—though the "functionally the same thing" hedge slightly softens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—navigating sorrow—is signaled early and tightens once when Kenji deciphers the lace and carries the compass to the bluff. The ritual beat narrows his emotional options (diffusion vs. crystalline shard), but the resolution is atmospheric rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens this is sufficient escalation, though the cost remains implicit in the final image rather than dramatized through a micro-choice.

    Stakes around decoding the signal escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from activating the chip to pulling the handle, with cost visible in the drone's strain and her focused effort. The dominant stake is clear and tightens meaningfully without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are centered on discovering the withheld truth, escalating through Elias's agency in sifting driftwood to the horrifying revelation. Under the causal lens, this tightening forecloses his passive search and forces a costly new path. The cost is unmistakable in the realization of Anya's erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of prisoner exchange escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from synchronized timing to the key turn in unlocking manacles. Cost is unmistakable in the fallen chains and Elias's reflection, narrowing options and foreclosing paths without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (internal conflict between heart and action) escalates under causal lens through Elias's agency, culminating in his choice to face the sea. Cost is legible in his trembling and the final step, narrowing options meaningfully. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of kindling empathy escalates through protagonist's agency, such as descending into the fissure and reading the letter. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional spark. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening narrows options from past-seeking to future-building.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Elian's agency in the ritual, driven by the Accumulative lens's density increase, with cost unmistakable in his bodily transformation and foreclosed humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (finding lost time) is signaled early and escalates through emotional deepening under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, culminating in the decision to let go with visible cost in the unfastening and new tracing. One meaningful tightening forecloses an option and reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in processing each photograph, tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her physical and emotional shifts, culminating in the climax where her own sorrow risks crushing her before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, from detour to light release, reweighting stakes with cost legible in the mountain's response. The dominant stake of understanding transformation tightens meaningfully, though the conflict is more internal and textural than external.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from seizing the blackout opportunity to activating the network. Stakes are clear, and cost is legible in the silent transfer of control, though it leans toward success without heavy personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—protecting the bluff from the tide—is signaled early and escalates through Kael's agency under the causal lens. His use of star dust narrows options and carries cost (last resort). Pressure tightens meaningfully from vision to action, with no coincidence resolving conflict. Cost is legible in his physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from setting the timer to discovering the envelope, narrowing options. The cost is unmistakable in the shift from "furiously tranquil" to "only the fury," forcing a trade-off between stasis and action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with fencing moves narrowing options based on the puzzle. However, cost is implied rather than unmistakably felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of rebuilding against decay escalates meaningfully with the drifters' arrival, narrowing options through Silas's agency. Cost is felt in the risk of trust, but the tightening is understated under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reuniting before reality frays—escalates under causal lens via Elian's agency: compass failure prompts film study and music composition. Cost is legible in leaving the arbor, though escalation is single-tiered but sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Causal lens, as the approaching monsoon tightens options and her panic pricks composure, leading to a meaningful turn where she layers the dreams. The cost is legible when her doubt transforms into part of the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Kenji's agency under the Accumulative lens, as deciphering the lace and using the compass lead to a deepening stake in overcoming grief, with cost legible in the softening of guilt. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will remain a detached observer or accept his entanglement in messy decay—is clear and tightened through his repeated returns and the growing emotional discomfort. The crucial escalation occurs at the orchid/weed moment, where his grief collides with the observed transfer of life, forcing him to abandon his goal of stripping drama away. While the conflict is quiet and internal, the final act of joining the cleanup reads as a genuine renunciation of a safer stance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict—Kaelen’s fear of fire and search for a new relationship to her art—is clear, with the smugglers’ off-page hostility as an external shadow. Pressure coherently deepens when she recognizes the frost as a cipher and chooses to risk following the path into an unknown tributary canyon. However, the external danger remains mostly conceptual; her approach to the cave is described, but the immediate sense of risk or possible confrontation is underplayed, which slightly flattens escalation. The emotional stakes of relighting the kiln do a lot of the heavy lifting but could be made more visceral to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform both the flower’s anticipation and her own terror into a coherent “silent symphony”—is clear and escalates when the capsize colors overwhelm the conservatory panes. The intrusion of jagged orange and suffocating indigo is a strong tightening beat that threatens her project and mental stability. Her choice to weave, not suppress, the trauma constitutes genuine agency under pressure. Stakes remain largely internal and aesthetic/psychic; they land, but the sense of cost could be made slightly sharper or more materially felt.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—ending the relentless spiritual noise—is clear and present from the outset, and there is a meaningful tightening when Elias chooses to pay the “immense cost” of using his rare talent to reach Olen-Thal. Internal and external conflicts are braided: the psychic pressure, the crushing depth, and the inert astrolabe all echo his inner burden. However, once he decides to go, the path to success contains no reversals or serious risks of failure on the page; the key fits perfectly, and the system works immediately. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady reveal than a mounting test of commitment, limiting tension in a piece aiming at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—survival and the shift from dependence to communal agency—are clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation comes as anonymous gifts move from mere sustenance to a meaningful, identity-laden object (the bell), forcing Elara to respond with a public promise and plan. The main tightening is internal/communal rather than confrontational; there is little overt opposition beyond circumstances and fear, so tension is more contemplative than sharp. The price (hard work, vulnerability, potential loss of the benefactor) is present but underplayed, which keeps the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—resolving the pain of “unused love” and healing the phantom connection—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued through the breathing ritual. Escalation is primarily textural: each breath deepens the interplay of clarity/mystery until the pattern breaks into the vision of sparks and the conceptual turn about love’s conservation. The cost is mostly emotional and interior, but it is legible at the end; the absence of external or interpersonal pressure keeps the tension more meditative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving his mind/self from temporal consumption—is clear and escalates as memories visibly degrade. His agency peaks when he decides to weaponize the maze against the fragment, forcing a trade-off between potential salvation and annihilation. The cost is sharp and on-page: he succeeds in ending the torment but loses his entire history. Tension is more internal and conceptual than adversarial, but it tightens coherently to the cataclysmic release of time.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Elara versus the enforcers’ attempt to sterilize the vault—is sharply laid out, and tension escalates as the Divider Wall collapses and the arcade defenses roar to life. Her strategy to impede rather than destroy is both specific and thematically apt, with the machines creating non-lethal but very tangible obstacles. The price is primarily in endurance and self-sacrifice, as she remains chained and exposed while chaos unfolds. Because the antagonistic force never appears directly on-page, some pressure remains abstract, but the mechanical mayhem and shouted curses give the stakes sufficient immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—whether Elias can transform his trauma into something bounded and survivable—builds effectively through the ritual of the forge and the intensifying interference of the aurora’s colors. The stakes feel emotionally high when he re-experiences the “sound like grinding glass and tearing silk.” Escalation is clear but primarily internal and ritualistic, with limited sense of alternative paths or genuine risk of refusal. The story could benefit from one more explicit moment where he nearly breaks or considers abandoning the process, to sharpen the felt cost of proceeding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s orientation toward time and destiny—never faces much on-page resistance; the heist-setup implies danger that never materializes in conflict. Discovering and taking the jar are frictionless, and his internal shift arrives without any real dilemma about what keeping such an object entails. The result is beautiful, but tension and escalation are underdeveloped compared to the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finish a meaningful lens vs. survive and move on—is signaled early and sharpened by the red warning and physical shudders. Escalation is coherent and situational: the station’s collapse steadily narrows options until she must forsake the sphere. The renunciation of her “sanctuary” and project is a tangible price that reconfigures her trajectory. The internal vs. external stakes weave well, though an additional complication or mini-reversal could intensify the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stakes—Leo’s existential survival and Julian’s attempt to erase and monetize the project—are clear and present early, and pressure coheres around whether Leo will remain a disposable “ghost” or assert agency. Escalation is well-handled: the discovery of Pier 7 raises the scale of threat, Julian’s arrival forces an immediate stance, and the pivot from expected chase to strategic containment is a genuine tightening driven by Leo’s decision. Internal fear (phobias, identity rupture) interweaves with external stakes in a way that informs tactics. The cost of choosing containment—what Leo stands to lose personally beyond abstract risk—is only lightly sketched, keeping this shy of a higher-band sense of unavoidable harm.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing this night’s unique silence-map before the star and opportunity vanish—is present but remains largely cerebral. There is some escalation as the hush “deepens” and the final star extinguishes, but threat and consequence stay abstract: we never concretely feel what’s lost if he fails this cycle. Kaelen’s main agency is to persist in his ritual and finish the glyph, which he does without serious resistance. The piece works as a quiet, meditative accumulative scene, but the conflict doesn’t quite tighten into a felt dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the prison and the origin of thought—pivots cleanly from prior loops into this one decisive, higher-risk attempt. Escalation is clear when prior low-stakes experiments with the violin give way to opening a forbidden data port and ignoring cascading error warnings. The conflict is primarily internal and conceptual but still has concrete consequences (reset vs. annihilation vs. breakthrough). The cost is somewhat abstracted rather than viscerally felt, which keeps the pressure just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether they remain locked in mistrust or risk vulnerable contact—is clear from the opening and deepens via the silent ticket ritual. The major tightening is Elias’s decision to abandon his post and follow her to the park, risking both his accustomed stasis and exposure of his surveillance. The cost at the end is emotional and relational: he chooses to reveal his spying and need rather than remain safely opaque. While tension stays subdued and mostly internal, it is coherent and escalates once in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s job and philosophy vs data-driven automation—is announced early and remains clear. Pressure escalates primarily through the solstice judging scene, where the machine side initially edges his in metrics, tightening the threat of dismissal. However, the climax hinges more on an emergent ecological payoff than an on-page decision under duress from Elias, so his agency peaks in preparation rather than in a visible, high-cost choice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris’s heretical theory will gain proof—is clear early, and the temporal window adds gentle time pressure. Elias’s agency in pulling the lever constitutes the main tightening, leading directly to the lateral echo and his inner reconfiguration. However, there is minimal resistance or complication; nothing seriously threatens failure, and no option carries a sharply differentiated risk on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth ramp than a pressured narrowing of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stake—decoding the ghost’s message and giving it voice—is clear and escalates from abstract obsession to a concrete, irreversible act (dipping the program). The key tightening is Elias deciding that reverent passivity has failed and that he must risk destroying the object, which narrows his options and carries implied cost. However, opposition remains mostly conceptual; nothing pushes back except his own caution, so tension stays muted rather than taut. The resolution is earned but gentle, with little sense of loss beyond the sacrificed artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will relate to the truth/ambiguity of Liam’s last message—is signaled early and tightened as she revisits the note and confronts the two possible readings. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the real “truth” lies in her own need for ambiguity, which forecloses the path of definitive closure about Liam with a felt emotional cost. Pressure is internal but coherent and steadily increasing; there are no false reversals or resets. The conflict remains deliberately quiet and introspective, which slightly limits the sense of escalation compared to the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stakes—being misidentified as the cause of a catastrophic failure and confronting his own failure to act—are clear and escalate as the factory’s attention narrows onto him. The turn from passive observer to someone who “had to appraise the scene not as a haunting, but as a problem to be solved” is a strong tightening that leads directly to the valve choice. Cost is more psychological than material but still felt in the effort and the lingering weight of his confession. The only slight limitation is that the underlying real-world catastrophe and his personal “doing nothing” stay abstract, keeping moral stakes just short of maximal vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—duty to witness versus the psychic cost of accumulated suffering—is clear, and the pressure of Aeridor’s fall escalates the need to act. However, the path from “unbearable” to using the swan is relatively frictionless; there’s little on-page resistance, complication, or risk to deepen that turn. Stakes are largely internal and thematic rather than situational, which fits the mode but slightly softens tension. The final stance (accepting cyclical burden with interludes of erasure) is earned, yet the escalation could be sharper with one more concrete cost or threatened loss.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary conflict—whether Lena can risk reconfiguring her relationship to lifelong grief—is clear and coherently pressured by the ticking clock of the eclipse. Escalation is gentle but real: music leading to opening the box, then to contact with the earth at totality, then to her new seeing of the curl and the sky. The agency lies mostly in small, interior-facing choices (opening the box, letting her hand be guided, allowing a new interpretation), which suit the piece’s mode but keep the stakes feeling contained. A touch more resistance or friction in the middle could have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the cause of humanity’s hollowing—is clear, and reading the diaries provides a meaningful deepening as Elara’s entries move from scientific to lyrical desperation. However, the pressure remains mostly intellectual; there is little sense that failure will concretely cost Kaelen anything beyond curiosity and sorrow. The final renunciation (accepting he is not a savior) does foreclose a path, but the story doesn’t quite tighten the screws on that conflict beforehand, so escalation feels restrained rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—pulling off a covert information exchange—never feels materially threatened on the page; there’s no complication, near-miss, or adaptation required. Internal stakes around Elias’s identity and whether he will keep “conducting” from afar or change his own “tune” emerge late and resolve smoothly. There is a clear tightening from planning to watching the exchange to deciding to leave, but pressure stays conceptual rather than visceral. The result is a graceful arc with modest, under-dramatized conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—freeing Elara before the possession completes—is clear and present early, and pressure grows as Alistair builds the layered sonic trap and the entity’s logic begins to fray. The meaningful tightening is the moment he glitches the looped “truth” and the entity stammers, showing its axiom under strain. Agency is strong: the resolution comes directly from his chosen line of attack, not coincidence. What’s missing at this level is any real risk of failure or visible price paid beyond fatigue; the conflict resolves a bit too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—completing his temporal composition before the once-a-year resonance and before exhaustion—appears early and tightens credibly as dawn breaks and the mirrored horizon forms. Pressure escalates when he realizes the map is incomplete and must dive one last time into memory to find a specific feeling, with his failing stamina and the fleeting resonance as constraints. His decisive act is the final connecting line and phrase, which relieves the cosmic “pressure in the air” and reconfigures his internal stake. Conflict remains largely interior and conceptual, so while the escalation is clear and satisfying, it never reaches a knife-edge of concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can end the loop by facing the originating trauma—is clear and coherently pursued. There is a meaningful tightening when he stops trying to “move forward” and instead chooses to retrace to the seed memory, and when he surrenders to pain to stabilize the world. Yet the internal conflict is somewhat under-pressured: once he decides to face the memory, success feels inevitable, with little sense that he might fail, recoil, or fracture further. The price (loss of gravity, full impact of grief) is present but could be dramatized with more immediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can use her odd method to cut through numbness (hers and others’)—is clear, and there is a gentle escalation as the vibrations swell and the group begins to react. However, there is little sense of risk or potential failure; the performance unfolds smoothly without obstacles or real trade-offs. The story deepens rather than tightens pressure, so the emotional payoff is strong but the conflict arc feels low-intensity. The resolution is earned, but the absence of a real test or complication caps escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict—between Elias’s need for safe solitude and the encroaching, systematized mystery targeting him—tightens effectively once the impossible storm data collides with the pigeon and quarantine zone. His shift from reactive unease to proactive but oblique engagement (refusing confrontation or official channels in favor of the tunnels) is a credible deepening of pressure. However, opposition remains mostly offstage and abstract, and there is no concrete loss or forced trade-off dramatized in the final beat. As a result, escalation is intellectually satisfying but not maximally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to be ruled by traumatic scent-memories or confront them—is established early and tightened as the Moon-Phlox begins its one-time bloom. The synchrony of the UV reveal on the vial and the flower’s transformation provides a clear escalation point, culminating in the arrival of “the one” scent. His agency at the end (choosing to stand still and grieve rather than flee or shut down) is a meaningful, costed resolution. The conflict is primarily internal and quiet, but it deepens coherently and does not feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the Lumin’s offer of transcendence vs. curated mortal decline—is legible early and deepens when Elias realizes the “choice” is a misframing of existence itself. Pressure escalates from abstract observation to a personal, irrevocable stance, with the Lumin’s silent waiting functioning as a clear situational force. The cost of his choice (continued suffering/decay in exchange for awareness and integrity) is present but could be made more palpably felt on the page. Still, his decision clearly forecloses both promised comforts.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict is internal and textural: how to respond to a suffocating, sacred hush without violating it, and whether music can release rather than destroy. Escalation is gentle but present—the “different, heavier” quiet, the remembered claim about music unbinding, then her choice to play not as attack but “offering,” followed by increasing resonance. The cost is mostly emotional/physical (aching arms, the risk of disturbing the hush), so tension never becomes sharp, but the pressure does meaningfully tighten toward a single experiment whose success or failure matters to her stance. The final drop functions as a quiet but earned culmination rather than a strong reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will fully take on the cost of crafting a half-truth—emerges early and tightens when he experiences the full, painful memory. The major escalation is his deliberate move from sensing to full contact, which forces him through joy into corrosive suspicion and betrayal, then into the difficult extraction of only the bright charge. The price he pays (keeping the sorrow) is clearly articulated and narrows his moral options going forward. Tension is more internal and meditative than sharp, which suits the piece but limits raw pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is whether Elias will act on his desire to honor “silent contributors” by approaching Alina with the grant and how she will receive it. There is a gentle tightening from anticipation to the reveal, with his internal “calculated risk” marking the primary escalation. However, opposition remains purely hypothetical; there is little sense that she might reject him or the gesture, and no complicating reversal once the envelope appears. The resolution is moving but low-friction, limiting felt cost and real tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen’s desire to belong—is signaled early and consistently, and his agency drives the key movements (joining the search, proposing the fissure, creating the mats, accepting the invitation to tend the arbor). Pressure escalates gently rather than sharply; there is no strong external opposition, so conflict remains mostly internal and situational. The meaningful tightening occurs when his insight about “overlooked spaces” pays off with the Echo tag, and the cost is paid in his overnight self-imposed labor and the quiet surrender of purely private art. For a top-tier venue, the lack of any sharper resistance or trade-off keeps the tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—prevent the giant from waking and destroying the city—is clear and substantial, and the Chronovore’s escalating disruption presents a strong conceptual threat. However, once Elias reaches the primary nest and the pendant activates, the path to solution is almost frictionless; there’s no failed attempt, sacrifice, or meaningful narrowing of options beyond “figure out how to use pendant correctly.” The conflict is more puzzle-like than agonistic, with little sense that he might pay a price for trying or fail in a way that worsens things. As a result, tension feels more intellectual than visceral at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can transform paralyzing, formless grief into a structured, livable understanding—is signaled early and follows through to the lattice visualization. Pressure deepens when nothing initially happens after he channels his emotions, and then tightens as the light reveals not Lyra but the architecture of his loss, forcing an internal recalibration. However, the conflict remains quite even-tempered; there’s little sense of genuine risk that the ritual could fail disastrously or worsen his state, which softens the felt cost of success. The piece succeeds as quiet internal escalation but stops short of sharper tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—the survival of a family’s last oral history and Anya’s academic/emotional salvation—are clear and human-scaled. Pressure escalates from Elias’s routine, low-stakes salvaging to the discovery of an urgent, irreplaceable fragment and his decision to break his usual protocol to deliver it. His agency directly resolves the problem, but the piece soft-pedals potential danger or conflict (no real risk of being caught, no serious internal battle about intervening), which keeps the tension more elegiac than sharp. As a result, the stakes feel genuine but the cost of his choice is more implied than intensely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias clings to control/old identity or accepts a transformation into a new life—is signaled early and coherently pressured by the storm damage. The tightening comes when the failed repair gives way to observing the vine’s adaptive behavior, narrowing his options from “restore” to “rebuild differently.” His closing decision to clear the wreckage and pursue an adaptable support structure (and a reframed retirement) is a genuine turn with cost, not mere re-labeling. The conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, so the tension is quiet rather than gripping, but it never goes static.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can wrest authentic meaning from a ravaged world—is clear and tested when the brooch becomes contested ground. The encounter with the woman tightens pressure by demanding he choose between keeping a perfect subject and honoring her claim in exchange for story. The cost is internal and ethical rather than perilous, but it’s felt in his relinquishing the object he’s just bonded with. Escalation is subtle and primarily internal, which fits the piece but keeps tension in a mid-high rather than peak range.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra will continue to guard/hoard the Heartstone or allow its power to be shared—is legible early and tightened by the cave’s new unpredictability and the loss of her clairvoyance. Escalation concentrates into the threshold scene, where the overlapping shadows and sudden flood of present-sight force a high-cost choice. The cost of surrendering her identity as guardian-seer and accepting obsolescence is clear and felt. Conflict could be sharpened by giving Kael more active opposition or desire on the page; as is, pressure is strong but mostly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the past of this shattered city can be meaningfully reclaimed to sustain its survivors—is implicit but clear. Pressure deepens when the abstract project gains a personal face in the old woman and her dead husband, yet there’s no true dilemma or narrowing of options; Kaelen’s path is never in doubt. The “turn” is more emotional recognition than conflict-driven escalation, so tension stays gentle rather than sharpening. As a result, the final reassurance carries feeling but not high-stakes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—to reach the fortress and uncover the mentor’s fate—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening when he realizes he’s being invited to become the next keeper. However, the journey presents almost no resistance: the cracks guide smoothly, the punch opens the wall without complication, and once inside, revelations arrive unopposed. Because Elias never faces a hard trade-off or visible price for accepting the guardianship, escalation feels more like steady unveiling than true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his skeptical grief into a living connection with his grandmother by completing her work—is clear and sharpened by his repeated failures and near-destruction of the tile. The storm and intensified whale calls provide an effective escalation, forcing him into a last-chance decision to engage instead of discard. The cost is largely internal and contemplative, so tension remains more meditative than urgent, but the pressure does tighten once in a meaningful way. A slightly clearer sense of what he risks emotionally by believing (or by failing) would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can Xylos force a true ending for himself despite the curse—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates coherently: storm intensifies, space begins to misbehave, the amulet fights back with the weight of his entire life, and he must choose to embrace the curse to master it. The final decision to step through the rift is a real narrowing of options with a conceptual and existential cost. Conflict remains largely internal and metaphysical, so while effective, it never quite reaches a white-hot test of his resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are strong on paper—Silus’s literal life, Elara’s legal and moral risk, and her need to atone. There is one clear tightening choice: she commits to using her father’s Ghost ink to forge official documents, fully crossing a line she’s avoided. However, the story presents no serious on-page complication, test, or near-failure of the plan; everything proceeds as designed, which keeps pressure from truly ratcheting. Internal moral conflict is expressed conceptually more than dramatized in a pressured beat, so the cost is more implied than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can successfully capture and embody another “invented history” against the encroaching silence—is clear but largely internal and aesthetic. There is one meaningful tightening when the lamp’s hum wavers at sunrise and she must act quickly to chart the waveform. Beyond that, pressure does not escalate so much as gently accumulate; there is little sense of what failure would concretely cost her in this moment besides disappointment. The piece works texturally, but conflict never quite sharpens into a true dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can meaningfully “own” a memory despite their bureaucratic erasure—is clear, and the tide night provides a focused test of that desire. Pressure escalates as more emotionally saturated fragments (the weeping woman, the newborn’s hand) are layered, culminating in the first convincingly “felt” pseudo-memory of the poison’s use. The ship’s horn and the dispersal of the composite memory function as a genuine tightening and loss, with the cost legible in the narrator’s solitary aftermath. Still, the conflict remains primarily contemplative and could bear one more concrete, present-moment risk or dilemma to hit a higher pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can Elias meaningfully reconstruct Thorne’s last observation and prove the “ephemeral compass” real for himself—is clear early. Pressure escalates through the repeated tuning attempts, the thickening air, and the eventual lock-in of the tone and glowing shell. The main cost is existential and vocational (choosing the quiet, possibly endless riddle over public work), but this remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through a live, painful trade-off on the page. As a result, tension is steady and satisfying but never razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether the Revel can survive corporate takeover without losing its soul—is clear early and sharpened by Kael’s recognition that open resistance means annihilation. Escalation comes through the decision to weaponize graffiti as infrastructure and the on-page test of that tactic when the inspector arrives and fails to fully categorize them. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (no immediate loss or betrayal), but the story acknowledges that he “hadn't saved the Revel,” so victory is partial and fraught. The internal conflict (rage vs reorganization) and external pressure are well intertwined but could push one more step into visible sacrifice to hit higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last bloom and honoring his grandfather—is legible from the start and tightens around the race against sunrise and lethal cold. Pressure escalates as the chemical lure matures and the blooms appear, then is resolved by the star’s ray erasing everything. Still, the conflict remains largely situational and contemplative; there’s little adaptation or hard trade-off beyond endurance, and no genuine risk of failure once he’s in place. The cost lands emotionally rather than through a sharply dramatized moral or tactical dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—get the drone repaired before the *Stellamar* departs—is clear early and sharpened by the repeated horn blasts. Pressure does escalate via the discovery of a deeper fracture and the shrinking time window. However, Elara’s unshaken composure and the absence of any real setback or moment of doubt dampen the sense of risk; success feels likely throughout. The conflict is coherent and satisfying but never quite hits a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—documenting the once-in-an-age singular convergence—emerges clearly, and tension builds from long stasis to the first uncanny frost-lines to the global “watershed” revelation. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals, culminating in his decision to drop skepticism and act as archivist. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and observational; nothing seriously tests his resolve or forces a trade-off beyond “watch or not.” As a result, the moment feels wondrous and important but not especially costly, which holds the stakes below elite intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (reviving the town, restoring balance) but largely uncontested; nothing on the page opposes or complicates Elias’s work beyond time and effort. Pressure rises only in a gentle, accumulative way as more echoes join him, but there is no real tightening, reversal, or cost. His patience and competence mean his path never narrows or feels at risk. As a result, the story reads more as an elegant vignette than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The core conflict—capturing the hush versus preserving her life—is clear from early on and tightens steadily as oxygen dwindles and the psychic assault intensifies. The crucial escalation is the reveal that the hush “touches memories,” transforming a conceptual experiment into a violent internal siege. Her decision to stay, surrender to the torrent, and extract a single serene thread is a meaningful trade-off that forecloses escape. One could imagine an extra tactical wrinkle (a false attempt to abort, or tool failure) to deepen escalation, but what’s here is still strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—claiming a true, personal story in the shadow of a liar father—emerges early and is tested by the hush discovery and the decision to break it. Pressure escalates from the general eeriness and whispers to the uniquely silent landing, then to the revelation of the frozen betrayal and the irreversible act of opening the sealed door. The cost is intellectual and reputational rather than visceral—he loses the impossibility as proof and knows he’ll be doubted—yet it’s legible and thematically appropriate. The conflict is more conceptual than suspenseful, so the tightening is thoughtful rather than harrowing, but still effective at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the haunting will resolve into a fulfilled or broken promise—is legible and escalates through increasingly bold appearances and the impending bloom. Pressure intensifies via the toxic flourishing and the once-in-a-century Night Phalaenopsis, giving a clear sense of build. However, Elian’s agency in that escalation is minimal; he doesn’t face a real dilemma or make a costly choice, and the climactic “transfer” simply happens to him. As a result, the conflict is emotionally affecting but somewhat static in terms of tactical adaptation or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether fragile, unconscious art can survive a hostile world long enough to become a new form of guidance—is clear and escalates meaningfully with the arrival of the catastrophic storm. The key tightening is Kaelen’s decision to override the dream-state and weave consciously with sturdier materials, trading safety and comfort (and skin) to give the dream structure. Internal and external conflicts overlap well: his panic at losing the tapestry collides with his identity as the “last of the wharf weavers,” sharpening the choice. The only drawback is that opposition is mostly environmental and time-based; there’s little sense that failure is a near-miss, so the resolution feels secure rather than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reclaim and reframe her lineage’s severed connection—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates modestly rather than dramatically: the discovery and slow freeing of the sundial deepen emotional investment but are not sharply opposed by time, antagonists, or major risk beyond labor and emotional exposure. The meaningful turn occurs at the ship carving, which reweights the entire enterprise, but the sense of cost is primarily internal and contemplative, not sharply tested. As a result, conflict feels convincing yet low-intensity, well suited to a quiet piece but short of maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—successfully transmitting a new, illicit identity outside surveilled channels—is clear, but it never meets on-page resistance. Kaelen encounters no obstacles, moral friction, or alternative tactics to weigh; each step proceeds as planned. As a result, escalation is mostly procedural/intellectual, with little sense of risk or cost, leaving the piece low on actual narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—forestalling a coup via a single covert transmission—is clear and escalates when the calibration window is framed as a one-shot chance and the system lag threatens failure. The tension is mostly procedural and internal; there’s little on-page antagonistic pressure (no guards interrupting, no immediate risk of discovery) to sharpen the conflict. Her agency is strong and the timing challenge provides a real tightening, but the conflict could feel more dangerous if a concrete on-page consequence pressed against her act. As is, the stakes are high conceptually but somewhat muted experientially.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to confront the exact moment before his life-fracturing choice—is legible early and drives the entire scene. Pressure escalates through the sensory intensification of the ritual and the condensation-messages, culminating in Kael’s painful recognition and Elara’s collapse. The conflict is largely internal and one-sided (no strong present-tense opposition besides psychic cost), which softens the sense of narrowing options. Still, the trade-off between clarity and emotional pain reads as a real price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can open a crack in the General’s emotional armor to serve the larger peace—is clear and threads the whole scene. Escalation is quiet but real: from noticing the symbols, to decoding them as a lexicon of shared anxieties, to weaponizing that tenderness in the father’s presence. The final tightening comes when Elias chooses exactly which “secret” to translate, forcing Varin into an emotional confrontation. The price is subtle (Varin’s vulnerability and implied political risk), but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can he recover and re-experience a lost joy in meaningful form?—is clear early and pursued throughout. Escalation is modest but present: the initial painting falters, colors bleed, and his frustration rises until the fragment shifts tactics and locks the mural into place. The cost is mostly emotional (the mural and joy are fleeting, and the remembered face carries sorrow), not a sharp foreclosing choice under heavy pressure. For a lyric, introspective piece this is sufficient, but the conflict never quite feels physically or morally tight enough for higher stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central pressure—safety/return vs exploratory curiosity—is coherent and tightened by his growing mastery of the garden’s mechanics. His final orchestrated sequence and the choice to embrace an unpredictable color register as a meaningful stance crystallization. Still, the conflict lacks teeth: he never faces a serious on-page loss, danger, or moral bind, so escalation feels elegant rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—securing a moment of untaxed thought versus risking massive cognitive harm—is clear and escalates from quiet dread in the garden to sirens at the greenhouse and the final activation. Pressure grows coherently under a causal lens, with the key tightening being the revelation that “passive readers are becoming active probes,” which collapses the viability of slow floral codes. Kaelen’s decision to proceed despite Aris’s warning gives the ending agency and cost, even if we don’t see consequences unfold beyond the immediate blackout. The main weakness is that the moral calculus (mass risk versus brief freedom) is not fully dramatized as an agonizing conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s unending pain and isolation remain pure torment or can be transfigured—is clear and deepens over the piece. Pressure escalates texturally as her centuries-long practice accumulates into a “phantom limb of the soul,” culminating in the “blossom armistice” where she accepts pain as fertile rather than adversarial. Her agency at the climax (repurposing the postcard and ending the practice of hiding poems in other shells) is meaningfully costly, foreclosing a prior pattern of response. The main limiter is that conflict never sharpens into a knife-edge decision; it’s a graceful realignment rather than a pressured crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving Simple Trust before it vanishes—is signaled early and remains coherent, with the last dying ember giving the scene implicit urgency. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the search for the right melody, the thickening air, and the sense that this might be the final chance for that feeling. However, there’s little on-page resistance or risk of failure beyond implication; the craft never feels in genuine danger of going wrong. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-friction arc whose cost is conceptual rather than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can regain Elara’s trust without destroying himself—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates mainly through the explanation of the symphony’s dangers and his unprecedented modification, culminating in the spell’s activation and Elara’s choice. However, the conflict path is relatively smooth; there’s little on-page resistance or complication once he begins writing, with tension residing more in declared risk than in evolving obstacles. The resolution is nevertheless earned by his deliberate, costly act and her cautious, not fully resolved acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciling duty and love via understanding his father—is clear and escalates as clues compound toward the hidden letters. The discovery of the chain’s etchings and the wall cavity are credible deepenings of pressure in a quiet, internal register. Yet Kaelen faces little genuine risk, opposition, or possibility of failure; once the method is introduced, success feels nearly guaranteed. The cost lands emotionally but the path there is relatively untested.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stakes—will Elias remain sealed in grief and fabrication or risk genuine connection and the dispersal of Lena’s music—are clear and grounded early. The storm functions as a well-timed escalation that yokes external danger (water destroying the compositions) to his internal storm, forcing an active response. The subsequent confession and sharing are a believable resolution of that pressure, though the conflict resolution is somewhat neat and free of lingering mess. Still, the story offers at least one strong tightening and a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will cross an irreversible threshold between realities—is clear and steadily developed from his sensing of the terrace’s edge to his decoding of the logbook and final step. Escalation is primarily conceptual: increased understanding narrows options rather than external peril, which fits but keeps tension somewhat cerebral. The cost (accepting permanent distance from his origin reality) is legible yet more stated than felt in his body or fears. One strong tightening beat (gateway appears; he understands there is no backtracking) gives sufficient pressure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Kaelen can make Elara see Aethelburg as living and thus find belonging himself—is clear, but pressure remains relatively gentle. Once he has Elara at the dome, nothing substantially threatens failure: the jellies arrive as predicted without complication or choice under duress. The time limit and failing systems are mentioned but don’t force any hard trade-offs or visible cost on the page. As a result, escalation is more a smooth swell of wonder than a tightening of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—completing the recollection before it fades—is legible early and resurfaces when the glass dims and the vines begin to recede, creating a real tightening. Conflict, however, remains largely intellectual and situational; there’s no antagonist and little internal resistance, so tension reads as “can Kael solve this in time?” rather than a deeper trade-off. The meaningful escalation is Kael’s “final, desperate conjecture” and physical experiment with the shard. The price is primarily the risk of losing the memory, which is conceptually strong but emotionally understated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is artistic: can Kael engineer a moment of genuine, unnoticed wonder from the debris of an empty arcade, and he succeeds through deliberate, escalating actions. Pressure does rise texturally as the tide approaches and we await the cascade, but the conflict is almost entirely external-mechanical; Kael faces little resistance or risk beyond the possibility of failure. His agency drives every key turn, but the lack of a stronger internal or relational dilemma limits the felt cost of success. As a result, the piece has beautiful tension on the level of “will the contraption work?” but not much beyond that.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Kaelen can channel forbidden cosmic patterns into the dust speck and inscribe the verse—is present and does escalate from failed attempt to transformative success. The key tightening comes when he shifts attention from external gaps (stars, moths) to the gaps between his own heartbeats and breaths, which unlocks the change. However, opposition is largely internal and abstract, with the nostalgia ban and any external risk never materially pressing him on the page. As a result, tension is felt but relatively low for a piece aiming at top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas will cling to or release his life’s work in the face of an impending environmental shift—is intelligible, and there is one clear deepening when he reads the pond’s ripples and understands the atrium is misfit for the world to come. However, pressure never quite sharpens into a dilemma: once he receives his answer, his acceptance is almost frictionless, with no serious temptation to intervene or deny. The “before everything shifts” frame promises a bit more tension than the story ultimately dramatizes on the page. A single concrete, competing option (fortify, sell, evacuate, etc.) would markedly raise the sense of stakes and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict is moral and psychological: the price of saving others versus the loss of one’s own innocence and wholeness. The Holloway cabin scene supplies the clearest pressure point—Elias’s split-second trade-off between the girl, the box, and his own body—and that cost underpins his present drive to mentor. In the present, stakes are quieter (whether Kaelen will truly grasp what the job asks), with the main tightening being the articulation of “bargained innocence.” The piece could feel even more urgent if the present-tense conflict or risk to Kaelen were more explicitly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can nudge a dying reality toward renewed vitality—appears early and is tracked via the gauge, with clear escalation when the needle “plunges towards zero.” The primary tightening is that apparent failure beat followed by a slow climb that tests her commitment and frames the success as nontrivial. However, the stakes stay largely abstract and bloodless; we’re told of a world “flickering towards grey apathy” but do not feel concrete loss or danger, nor does Elara face a meaningful personal sacrifice. The tension functions and resolves cleanly, but doesn’t fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central pressure—whether and how Elara will carry or alter the legacy she uncovers—is clear and does deepen as she moves from vague anxiety in the walls to the specific horror of Prometheus. Escalation is primarily conceptual, culminating in her choice to record without “owning” the guilt, an Earned Stasis that forecloses the path of exposing or removing the evidence. The stakes remain largely internal and intellectual, so the tension is quiet rather than gripping. The cost of her decision (and what she risks by leaving things hidden) could be made more legible.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary stake is whether the painter can successfully seed these fleeting possibilities before the bells, but there is almost no resistance beyond the clock. The pressure does tighten slightly as the ritual unfolds and the bells loom, yet the outcome never feels in doubt and no meaningful price is extracted. The city vignettes add emotional color but not real escalation or risk. As a result, tension is pleasant and lyrical rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—will these two finally sign—is clear from the outset, and tension coheres around the risk of relapse into war. Escalation is subtle but present: their embodied resistance, the “moment fraying,” then Elias’s pivot to the dust-sigil as a last attempt. The signatures themselves carry conceptual cost, though the price (forfeiting identity as warriors) is more told than viscerally dramatized. Another small, concrete threat or loss on the page would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can enact a meaningful form of penance by sacrificing the last egg—is clear and present early, and the pressure tightens as he moves from approach to actual dissolution. The key turn is his micro-decision to go through with placing the egg in the corrosive brine despite trembling hands and unresolved guilt. The cost (erasing the last physical remnant of the species without personal absolution) is legible and scaled to the length. The conflict remains more meditative than sharply escalatory, which keeps it from the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—using accumulated sorrow to seed inner rebellion in the city’s rulers—is clear and conceptually strong. Yet on the page, the conflict is almost entirely unopposed; the ritual unfolds as a foregone success with no serious doubt, counterforce, or sacrifice dramatized in real time. Internal resistance is also minimal; Elara never appears genuinely tested in her resolve. This keeps escalation and felt cost from matching the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen’s artistic method harms or responsibly challenges his audience—is clear and pressed throughout. Pressure escalates from Elara’s accusation to the specific image of the hollow-eyed man, which sharpens the ethical risk and forces a new decision about his next show. The conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, but it still produces a concrete, forward-moving choice with real cost (abandoning the safety of pure ambiguity). A slightly more acute sense of what he fears losing (reputation, self-concept, artistic purity) would deepen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last migration before extinction—is legible from early on, and pressure coheres around the dwindling flow of butterflies and the implicit deadline of the very last monarch. The meaningful tightening comes as he realizes how sparse the migration is and rushes to complete the final structure before the last butterfly passes. However, resistance remains largely situational rather than sharply dramatized; his agency is quiet and rarely opposed, so escalation feels more like rising poignancy than a true crucible. It works for the mode, but the conflict is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can meaningfully resurrect or honor Lyra’s name—is clear and internally important to him. Pressure gently deepens as he translates the card’s holes into braids and then waits to see if the reconfigured rope will respond. However, the process is almost entirely smooth; there are no setbacks, risks, or trade-offs beyond time and concentration, so escalation remains mild and contemplative rather than tense. The final “cost” is largely conceptual (accepting partial success) rather than dramatized as a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear: unlocking the bunker’s true purpose and his own relationship to the directive before the place is destroyed. Pressure escalates in a satisfying way—from abstract decay and prophetic dread to literal shudders, ceiling cracks, and rising water that force an immediate decision. The internal conflict between preserving the old role and risking everything on a bizarre interpretation is present but somewhat under-developed in the moment of choice; he accepts the dream’s implications a bit too smoothly. Nonetheless, the final act forecloses the path of mere maintenance and embraces transcendence with a credible, costly commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Kavi can successfully “uncloak the sky’s greatest secret” and what he will pay for it—is clear and escalates through the narrowing window of alignment and ritual completion. Pressure builds texturally as he commits resources (dust, time, secrecy, his “thrift”) and culminates in the apparition of the star-cloud and his choice to dismantle the altar and keep the knowledge private. The conflict stays largely internal and contemplative; there’s little resistance or uncertainty once the ritual begins, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—heal or let the universe perish in Vale’s resentment—is explicit and escalates as Vale recoils and reality outside contorts more violently. The sanctuary tearing and “grinding dimensions” mark a clear tightening, forcing a now-or-never choice. Elara’s agency in focusing the memory, pushing into the origin wound, and finally pressing the coherent light into the music box memory drives the resolution. However, the personal cost to Elara is underplayed (she fades peacefully), which slightly blunts the sense of sacrifice despite the large-scale stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether she can manifest and stabilize her father’s lost dream—is clear and thematically meaningful. Pressure escalates as the frost begins to obey her breathing, culminating in the fragile, momentary success and the inevitable fracture when her control lapses, which provides a credible cost. The conflict is almost entirely internal and ritualistic; there is no resisting force beyond entropy and the fog’s conceptual weight, so tension remains quiet rather than gripping. This works for a lyric piece but keeps the escalation from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—saving the Heartwood and, symbolically, repairing the breach with Lyra—are clear and converge at the seed/ribbon choice. There is a meaningful escalation from simple technical problem to a philosophical and emotional one, with Elian forced to abandon his tried-and-true tools. However, opposition is mostly conceptual; the external problem yields almost immediately once he adopts the new approach, so consequence and resistance feel muted. The result is satisfying but a bit too smooth for maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen’s need to understand his role in a paradoxical system versus the mandate not to—is well signaled and culminates in his reorientation toward being a conduit. Escalation is primarily internal, via increasing paradox pressure and the focused act of inquiry into the cameo; that deepening is coherent but relatively gentle. The final choice (to embrace clarity and return to the orchard) forecloses his previous posture of resistant confusion, but its cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized in concrete consequences. Strong for a quiet, conceptual piece, but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to the Library to avert Kael’s future—is established early and tightened via her indirect strategy (tracking absences, decoding flora, confronting Curators). The key escalation is the shift from solitary investigation to direct renegotiation with powerful gatekeepers, culminating in the mountain’s chord of acceptance. However, the Curators never present strong, active resistance; the risk feels more asserted than dramatized, and Elara doesn’t visibly sacrifice an option or pay an immediate price. Tension is steady and thoughtful rather than sharply escalating, which limits punch at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s psychic integrity versus her need to retrieve her brother’s lost narrative—is clear and escalates as each recapture attempt further destabilizes her own memories. Pressure rises when her experiences begin to overwrite, not just overlay, her life, culminating in the total wave of “narrative sensation” at the console. The resolution—accepting that he had no name to recover and choosing to be his story—feels like an earned stance crystallization with emotional cost. The conflict remains entirely internal and lacks any counterforce besides the ticking degradation of memory, which keeps it just shy of truly searing.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to handle an impossible door linked to erased histories—is clear, and Elias’s decision to integrate rather than banish it is a meaningful stance. However, pressure doesn’t truly escalate: once he identifies the seal and rope, everything proceeds without complication, resistance, or credible risk. There’s no moment where a real option is foreclosed with visible cost, or where the attempt threatens to fail or backfire. As a result, the story reads more like an elegant procedural demonstration than a conflict that tightens under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—ending the torturous hum and restoring harmony—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates as he moves closer to the Chamber of First Frost and reaches a peak when the stone flares and the cave shudders. However, the conflict never seriously threatens failure; there’s no meaningful reversal or sacrifice beyond concentration and physical strain. The resolution, while satisfying, arrives a bit too smoothly for maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—can Elian reawaken connection in a dead world by rekindling the beacon?—is signaled early and tightened by the once-in-a-century alignment. Pressure escalates as he assembles the prism, with the shard of hush introducing an internal reversal where he nearly capitulates to cosmic silence. His agency at the climax (choosing to insert the shard despite overwhelming memories) drives the outcome rather than coincidence. The cost is primarily emotional and existential rather than materially dramatized, but it is clear and scaled appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to confront the buried collective trauma—is clear and escalates from unease at the discordant hum to a core revelation about the fog’s origin. The major tightening arrives with the colossal bolt and glyph alignment, which forces engagement with the “core memory” rather than continued curating at the surface. Kael’s final act is an earned renunciation, choosing not to dismantle the fog but to reframe it, and that does foreclose a path. The main limitation is that the emotional/ethical squeeze at the climax is more implied than fully felt as a concrete, pressured dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can extract a meaningful, hope-bearing pattern from a ruined, silent world—is clear and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates modestly: hours of fruitless searching lead to discouragement, then the rag knot reopens possibility and sharpens his method. Conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, with no hard external constraint or sharply defined loss if he fails tonight, keeping the tension quiet rather than urgent. The final stance change feels earned but not hard-won under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will respond to Kael’s decision—is clear, and the tension of her delayed answer against his anxious waiting creates a modest but coherent pressure. The internal conflict between immediate hurt and long-pattern thinking is present, and her eventual acceptance is plausibly earned. However, escalation is more a gentle deepening than a tightening: conflict softens into contemplation without a truly sharp turn or felt narrowing of options, which limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Elian can find a silence that doesn’t suffocate him—is clear and threaded throughout, and the ascent itself is a credible test of his fear of openness. The main tightening comes in the midair struggle (“his contracted muscles and spirit fighting the instinct to curl into a ball”) and the later lurch as gravity returns, which frame the trellis visit as a brief, risky reprieve. The cost is largely emotional and conceptual rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices; he never truly risks losing the trellis or failing to return. This keeps the conflict effective but relatively low-pressure for a piece aiming at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman can move from terror in silence to solace—is clear and escalates as Elian actively redirects her attention through increasingly subtle sounds. The pressure is quiet but coherent, culminating in her altered bearing and voice at the dock. Still, the conflict resolves without a significant sense of risk or potential failure; her resistance fades relatively quickly, so the tightening never feels particularly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes (system-wide cultural purge versus preservation through rightful “filling” of the throne) are sharply signaled and maintained, with the sunrise clock giving a structural squeeze. The main escalation is temporal—the sky lightening as she reaches the prime layer—and conceptual, as each peeled layer reveals prior failures, tightening the psychological pressure. However, conflict is largely one-way: once she gains access, her approach works as intended without a true reversal, loss, or adaptation beyond diligence. The lack of a concrete obstacle or forced trade-off in the final third slightly flattens what could be an even more gripping climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can help Liam remember how to breathe without re-entering in a suffocating way—is clear and culminates in his physical/emotional release. Pressure escalates through the decision “It was time to encroach” and the ritual’s activation, then tightens in the cross-cut to Liam’s suffocation and his sudden, effortful breaths. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided and interior, with limited sense of what real alternatives or risks Elara is weighing beyond the implied moral stakes. The cost of this encroachment is gestured at but not sharply dramatized as a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—prevent or redirect the catastrophic collapse of a Quantum Promise while resisting its seductive pitch—is clear early and escalates coherently as she moves closer to the lattice. Her decision to volunteer is a meaningful tightening beat, and approaching/engaging the unstable node with the bolt raises both personal and environmental risk. Internal conflict (temptation vs. earned skepticism) meshes well with external stakes. The resolution is perhaps a bit too cleanly victorious (no visible loss beyond endured risk), so the sense of paid cost is strong but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—will she uncover the true reason for her dynasty’s decline—is established early and the pressure escalates via the intensifying ritual and rising hum. Internal conflict is present but mild; there is little sense of what failure tonight would cost beyond continued uncertainty, and no real resistance or competing desire complicates her pursuit. The escalation is primarily sensory and conceptual, culminating in the flood of understanding rather than in a choice under duress. The turn is meaningful but the stakes remain somewhat abstract and safe, limiting the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—averting the collapse of reality into “dull certainty”—is signaled early and tightened as the greenhouse destabilizes and the storm peaks. The decisive act of unsnapping the clasp at a precise instant is clearly a point-of-no-return choice that could cost Kaelen his tether and self. External and internal conflicts are aligned, but internal tension is underplayed; his sacrifice feels more dutiful than agonized, which slightly softens the felt price. Still, escalation is coherent and the climax is undeniably driven by his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find sustaining meaning in her work amid personal loss—is clear and deepens as she moves from routine cataloging to an intimate, ethically charged choice to honor the hidden relic. The key escalation is the discovery and decoding of the button’s message, which reframes both Joseph’s file and Elara’s own narrative of loss. Pressure is quiet but coherent; her agency appears in how she interprets, preserves, and ritualizes the find. The piece could push higher stakes by sharpening a dilemma (e.g., protocol vs. empathy), but as a quiet story, the conflict functions strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether any shard of unaltered history can still be injected into a pacified populace—is clear from early on and coherently pursued. Pressure builds through the journey out of surveillance-heavy areas into forbidden terrain and culminates in the risky activation of the phone booth. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided; the Directorate’s power is atmospheric rather than active, and Elara’s plan meets no concrete resistance or setback on the page. The escalation is thus more a steady approach than a tightening vise, with limited visible cost beyond implied danger.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coded prophecy from manifesting—is clear and scaled to the scene. Pressure escalates coherently as the drip-pattern shifts into code, Elias responds with his specific musical technique, and the prophecy’s rhythm falters and vanishes. The cost is mostly internal and existential (lonely vigilance, recurring sorrow) rather than a concrete sacrifice or near-failure, and the outcome feels assured once he begins to play. The conflict works and is thematically rich, but the lack of a sharper test or visible risk to his success keeps it below the very top tier for stakes and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the arbor’s message and potentially waking it—is clear, and pressure does gently tighten when the anomalous leaf and moonstone speck appear, culminating in the choice to prod. However, conflict is largely internal and very mild, with little articulated fear, risk, or opposing force to sharpen the decision. The prophecy frames the act as momentous, but on the page it feels almost guaranteed-success, reducing tension. Escalation exists but remains soft, keeping this above average but short of truly compelling pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant conflict is internal/philosophical, braided with a low-key external puzzle: can Elias follow this pattern and what does he do with what he finds. Escalation is present but gentle, moving from small oddities (cogs) to an engineered mechanism to an awe-inducing cavern; there’s no real danger or sharp trade-off moment beyond the existential shift in how he relates to uncertainty. His key choice is to improvise and proceed into the unknown, and then to sit and accept being “part of the question,” but the felt price of that acceptance is only lightly sketched. Stakes suit a quiet literary piece but could be sharpened with one more pressured or risky beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can transform his relationship to Elara’s memory without violating the laws of alchemy—is legible and escalates as the ritual intensifies toward the coin’s fracture. The conservation-law tension and need for “balance” give the middle a genuine tightening that culminates in the silent crack of light. However, the text hints at catastrophic risk without dramatizing a real possibility of failure or severe cost beyond exhaustion. As a result, the conflict is moving but somewhat safe, with emotional stakes more acute than procedural ones.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Silas must help a spirit whose grief distorts the gorge—escalates from eerie music to painful shriek when he challenges her fixation on silence. His strategic pivot toward eliciting laughter is a clear tightening that changes tactics and resolves the problem. However, his success comes relatively easily once he names his method, with little sense that he might fail or pay a sharper personal price. The stakes feel emotionally meaningful but low-risk for him, which limits intensity for a competitive market.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—prove the logic of mercy or be erased by the system—is intriguing but largely conceptual on the page. Pressure does intensify via the hum, path, and focal tree, culminating in the voiced ultimatum, yet Kaelen never faces a concrete, time-bound decision beyond enduring and listening. His main “choice” is an internal reframing (stop trying to escape, start trying to understand), which is thematically apt but low on dramatized cost. The conflict feels more like a continuous mood of oppression than a sharply escalating dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—liberating a buried history—appears early and is consistently pursued, with a clear tightening when the wrong details of the painting reveal there’s a lie to unfasten. Conflict is more situational and metaphysical than adversarial; there’s no opposing agent, and resistance is framed as a “silent, wrenching pull” rather than an escalating struggle. The stakes remain conceptual and elegiac, not visceral, but the piece does achieve one meaningful intensification in the underpainting reveal and the subsequent act of unfastening reality. The cost of the act could be made more materially or psychologically acute for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—whether Leo will engage with the ghost’s problem or stay within the narrow job brief—is clear and coherently escalated by the power cut and the ghost’s anxious gesturing. The “moment of choice” is well framed and leads to a concrete, embodied action (getting the ladder, opening the ceiling, taking the object). However, the stakes remain almost entirely spiritual and professional, with no real risk or deep internal fracture on the page. As a result, the tension is elegant but somewhat gentle for top-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the perfect system will be destabilized/compressed into a single moment—is clear and escalates through the hum, trembling books, and eventual rupture. The Operator’s agency drives the key turn (uncorking the whisper, guiding the frost), and the rupture forecloses the prior status quo. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided and abstract; there is no meaningful resistance, risk of failure, or alternative path that must be renounced on the page. As a result, the stakes read more conceptual than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether this lost civilization is remembered as tyrants or poets, and whether Kaelen can mount a “second revolution” through interpretation—is clear and coherently pressured by the approaching squall. Escalation comes primarily from the storm’s onset and the shard’s unexpected behavior, which deepen stakes from abstract theory into experiential evidence. Kaelen’s agency is present in his choice to treat this as proof and plan a strategy rather than dismiss it as fantasy. The conflict remains mostly internal and intellectual, with opposition (Valerius, institutional risk) kept offstage, limiting visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (world’s song vs. rust’s lie) is clear and active, and the pressure point is well-chosen: the rust’s voice injects doubt at the most delicate moment of tuning. The escalation from calm preparation to near-collapse (his slip, chip dimming, chamber hum faltering) is effective, and his internal stance shift resolves the conflict. However, the test is singular and brief—once he recovers his conviction, success comes without further complication or trade-off. For elite-level stakes, one more tangible cost or resistant beat would strengthen the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—will Elara try to capture and categorize this impossible petrichor, or accept and leave it unbottled—are clear and resolved by her final choice. Escalation is present but gentle: the physical descent, the compass failure, the draining psychometry, and the secret hinge all tighten the path toward discovery. However, the story rarely feels precarious; there is little sense of danger, time pressure, or serious inner resistance, so the cost reads more intellectual and spiritual than truly wrenching. For top-tier venues, slightly sharper pressure or more palpable risk would strengthen the conflict spine.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The external stake (survive a potentially annihilating wave) is concrete and escalates coherently from background storm to imminent obliteration. The lantern slide’s final layer both tightens options and demands swift, physically costly action, and Elara’s agency plainly determines the outcome. Internal stakes (her understanding of her work and the shore) braid in smoothly with the external crisis. The only limitation is that the moral/ethical calculus is relatively straightforward: there’s little sense of competing goods beyond risk vs survival.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—answering the night-bloom question and, by extension, situating herself in a generational lineage—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates modestly through her methodical probing of the window and the successive revelations in the glass. However, opposition is largely environmental and interpretive, with little sense that she might fail or pay a meaningful price beyond effort and time; conflict never becomes truly sharp. The result is a graceful progression rather than a genuinely tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—winning access to Elara’s guarded truth from the antagonistic memory—remains coherent and tight throughout, and Kaelen’s choice to abandon direct “why” questions for an aftermath-focused statement is the meaningful escalation. That reframe credibly narrows options and forces him to prioritize legacy over judgment, creating a small but clear cost to his previous approach. The psychic and ethical pressure is strong but largely interior and conceptual; the lack of a more concrete or time-bound threat slightly softens the felt stakes and keeps this from reading as fully “ratcheted” under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen will commit to the slow, authentic recreation of a civilization—is clear, and we see the cost in his exhaustion and the scale of the task. However, most of the conflict is summarized as past temptation (“for a year he had done nothing”) rather than dramatized as live opposition within the scene. The on-page pressure deepens slightly with his fatigue after two lanterns and the awareness of thousands more, but there is no strong reversal or test that truly jeopardizes his resolve. The result is conceptually weighty but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the city’s emotional richness will feed an approaching annihilating stillness—is clear and potent. Escalation is primarily informational: pressure tightens as he discovers the ward’s true function and his own inadvertent complicity rather than through external pushback or concrete obstacles. His agency emerges in the final renunciation/mission (“find a way to make a whole city forget how to feel”), which forecloses his prior path and provides a real conceptual cost. The absence of any on-page resistance, test, or trade-off beyond this realization keeps the conflict strong but not fully maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—saving the inherited pocket reality before it dissolves—is clear, and there is some sense of urgency from the “rising tide of disorder.” However, pressure escalates only mildly; there’s no genuine reversal, resistance, or narrowing of options beyond the initial setup. Her method works as described without visible risk of failure or trade-off, so tension remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as precarious. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won, capping the conflict band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (preventing catastrophic siren activation vs. hearing the sky’s true song) is clear and coherently escalated through the countdown. His agency at the breaker is decisive, but there’s almost no active opposition—protocols and systems don’t push back, and his workaround unfolds without complication. As a result, tension feels more ceremonial than contested, and the price of his risk is more implied than viscerally tested. Strong structure, but the conflict never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Kael’s desire to move from detached observation to a more vulnerable, transformative engagement with endings—is coherent and escalates when he chooses to truly “empathize” with the meteor. The stakes are primarily internal, and the decisive turn (pressing the glass to the main eyepiece, choosing to feel) tightens the pressure on his self-conception. However, the pressure remains contemplative; there’s little sense of risk beyond emotional exposure, which keeps the tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will cling to his sacred silence or risk opening the box to free Lyra—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure coheres as the ghosts grow more insistent and Lyra directly indicates the box, culminating in his decision to open it. Internal and external conflicts (guilt vs. haunting) are well braided, but his capitulation feels smooth, with little on-page struggle or alternative considered in the moment. The cost is felt in regret and relinquishing his constructed “prettier cage,” but the escalation could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to grasp time’s texture before his own runs out—is clearly signaled, but the pressure on that stake rarely tightens in concrete ways. His main tactic (the garage sale messages) is interesting yet largely summarized, and the crucial reversal arrives via an off-page traveler’s line rather than escalating conflict or a forced trade-off. His final act (pressing the fragment into the wall) is a simple, almost risk-free gesture that pays off spectacularly. The conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual, with stakes felt but not truly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is how Kaelen will handle the rupture of the child’s loss: engage directly (comfort, “mend”) or remain in his role as observer-weaver and “tend to its aftermath.” That tension is clear but extremely low-key, and escalation is more about deepening contemplation than narrowing options. Once he decides not to go to the child, the remaining “pressure” is essentially how to arrange the experience into meaning. As a result, the conflict feels artistically apt but emotionally safe for an elite-market piece.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—complete the interspecies connection before his illness ends him—is legible early and pays off at the climax when he makes the last connection and the system responds. Escalation is quieter and more accumulative than sharply turning: the “days bled into weeks” montage shows cost and weakening body but offers little new opposition beyond time and fatigue. The final hum, glowing wires, and unified heartbeat do reweight the original goal with a visible price (his life and surrender). The conflict works, but for elite-level tension it could benefit from one sharper complication or trade-off en route.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris can maintain pure skepticism versus allowing a shared, constructed meaning—remains focused and coherent. Pressure escalates as he moves from mocking the pilgrimage to feeling its pull, culminating in the choice to relinquish the amber and symbolically join the pattern. Internal and external conflicts are well-braided, but the tension is relatively low-key and contemplative, never quite feeling like a truly sharp trade-off under duress. The cost is present but mostly conceptual and professional, lightly sketched rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether his small acts of planting can responsibly answer a vast ecological death—is clear but plays out with very low on-page pressure. His labor, backache, and the birds’ critical commentary create a faint sense of test, yet there is no genuine narrowing of options, credible risk of failure, or ethical trade-off dramatized in scene. The escalation is mainly quantitative (more seeds, more spots), not qualitatively tighter, so the final commitment to return tomorrow feels noble but lightly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—bridging the gap between dead past and living future—is clear and gradually tightened as Elara moves from passive listening to arduous decoding and then to leaving safety. Internal and external conflicts are aligned, but resistance is mild: the primary obstacles are time, effort, and uncertainty rather than concrete danger or sharp trade-offs. The main turn (realizing the cylinder is a riddle) is strong, and the journey to the fissure is a credible escalation. Still, there is little sense that failure would exact a sharply felt price beyond disappointment, which softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her anomalous perception marks her as broken or blessed—is legible and the temporal distortion escalates toward a clear peak with the glimpse. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and relatively unopposed; nothing significant resists her re-framing beyond prior loneliness, and there’s no serious sense of what she risks by embracing her “blessing.” As a result, the turn reads more as a smooth illumination than as a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—amending the paradox’s confinement by altering Sylas’s relationship to control—is legible, and Kael’s plan-driven agency does resolve it. However, conflict is conspicuously low; the climb and the theft proceed without genuine setbacks or real risk of discovery beyond a momentary distraction beat. Sylas never becomes an active source of opposition, so there’s little escalation beyond “will the trick work,” and no meaningful price is paid. The result is elegant but soft in pressure, more a graceful caper vignette than a truly pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary conflict—Elara versus the Regent’s controlled narrative and the captivity embodied by the unseen prisoner—is clear and escalates via the successive word-patterns and narrowing time before Elara is “excised.” The final confrontation, where Elara weaponizes authentic grief in silence, is a strong, character-driven turn that forces the Regent into a real moral choice. However, the practical stakes (what happens to Elara or the regime if she’s caught; who the prisoner is) remain largely symbolic, so the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally dangerous. That keeps the pressure from fully peaking despite the elegant structure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will stay dissociated in safer phantoms or risk pain to reclaim her talent and sense of home—is clear and escalates from rumbling discomfort to an active internal precipice. Pressure tightens at the inert-stone disappointment and again at the feather moment, which reads as a genuine risk of self-shattering. The conflict is primarily internal and quiet but remains coherent and cumulative, culminating in her choosing presence and small, concrete acts of change. The price and danger feel more implied than sharply dramatized, keeping this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can genuinely confront and reprize his role in the prince’s death—is clear early and sharpened through the tapestry cipher. Pressure escalates as he maps specific threads to specific past moves and glances, culminating in the painful revelation of the simple move he refused. The cost is internal and quiet but real: relinquishing his self-image as a brilliant savior for the humbler truth of his vanity. The conflict remains mostly contemplative, so readers seeking a sharper external test of that new stance might want one more on-page resistance beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the society will accept enforced silence as the price of “forgiveness” or have that premise destabilized—is introduced early and sharpened by the looming ritual and horn signal. Pressure escalates from local risk (being overheard in the vertebra cavern) to existential defiance (the final poem hurled at the canyon itself). Elara’s last choice is costly (she’s caught) and clearly reconfigures the situation for everyone else by breaking the hush. The piece could gain further by staging more active opposition from the Wardens before the end, rather than mainly implied threat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—can she reconstruct a truthful, meaningful history in the time of one breath—is established early and tightened effectively as she climbs the statue’s body toward the worst wound. Conflict escalates both externally (time, pressure, leviathan’s shadow) and internally (fear of falsifying memory culminating in paralysis at the heart crater). The reversal at the climax is credible: she abandons factual completeness for narrating meaning, at a felt cost to her need for “truth” and her fear of comforting lies. If anything, the external danger could have been foregrounded one notch more at the peak, but the integration of internal and external stakes is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding a place “beautiful enough to hold their forever” and thus completing his private mourning task—is clear. Escalation comes from his deviation into the unknown tunnel and the discovery of a place that reframes what fulfillment of the promise could mean, culminating in the act of release. However, opposition is minimal and there’s little felt risk or serious alternative to completing the ritual once the oasis appears, so pressure never truly tightens. The internal conflict at the moment of opening his fingers could be more acutely dramatized to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (guiding the Stellaria to safety and proving a gentler method works) is clear, and the piece builds focused pressure as Elias commits to his risky, quiet approach. The escalation is largely accumulative and internal—sustained concentration and emotional strain rather than external reversals—which suits the mode but keeps tension fairly even. We don’t see a robust narrowing of options beyond the initial turn away from the foghorn method, nor a sharply felt price for success beyond exhaustion and vulnerability. As a result, the climax feels graceful and satisfying but not fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will manage to build a functional “lighthouse” and what that means for his grief—is established early and followed through. However, escalation is relatively gentle: the midnight call provides a final instruction, but Elias never faces a substantial on-page obstacle, doubt, or counter-pressure. Internal and external conflicts track together, yet no live option is dramatically foreclosed beyond the implicit acceptance that his daughter will not return. The result is moving but low-tension, more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reclaim any private interiority—is clear early and sharpened by the attunement instructions requiring a “most painful truth” during a storm. Pressure coheres: his desperation, the cost of the truffles, and the violence of the storm underscore that this is a high-stakes, maybe one-shot attempt. The neighbor’s question the next day is a simple but effective test of the new equilibrium. The conflict remains mostly internal and could have used one more concrete snag or risk in the ritual itself to heighten jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s need to understand the stranger’s gesture enough to resolve his own unease—appears early and persists. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, as borrowed memories accumulate and the isolation he feels begins to double, culminating in the interpretive “click” near the end. There is a meaningful deepening when he reframes the man’s trip to the sea as surrender rather than new beginning, which narrows his interpretive options and reweights the object. However, there’s little on-page sense of alternative tactics or real risk in failure, so the pressure remains relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—honoring Elara’s promise and confronting the possibility of other lives—is clear and coherently escalated through the search, apparent dead end, and sudden apparition of the doorway. The key tightening comes when he finally sees concrete alternatives and must choose between entering or accepting his existing path. However, external pressure (the rising creek, risk of being trapped) and internal ambivalence at the threshold are relatively mild, so tension never quite peaks into genuine uncertainty about what he will do.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—escape into oblivion vs continued, onerous rule and guardianship—is clear, with rising pressure as dreams solidify into the grotto and then into the pool’s revealed cost. The decisive tightening comes when she sees prior rulers dissolved into the light, forcing a concrete ethical and existential choice. Her refusal forecloses a path with visible cost, but the resistance at the moment of near-contact feels a shade too swift and controlled, slightly muting peak tension. Additional on-the-brink struggle or near-failure would sharpen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can genuinely capture presence before Kael leaves—is clear and focused, with his decision to go providing immediate external pressure. Escalation is modest but effective: her frustration with sterility is sharply tightened when his leaving makes the cost of failure visceral, forcing a new, riskier method. The final choice to pour her whole emotional history into the sphere, accepting its imperfection and his departure, reads as an earned and priced action. The conflict stays mostly internal/relational and could benefit from one more concrete obstacle or consequence, but it remains coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reframe his time-fractured existence from torment into a coherent narrative—emerges early and tightens as jealousy crescendos into a trance that forces a new vantage point. There is a clear escalation from frustration to near-breakdown to transcendent perspective. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and somewhat linear; the piece could benefit from one sharper friction point (e.g., a concrete reason he *needs* this narrative now) or more visible price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are quiet but clear: can Elara genuinely “humanize” the screw, honoring the wife’s work and thereby justifying her own new vocation. Pressure escalates as she commits to the reading, risking emotional failure for both herself and the old man; the beat where her hands tremble and she begins to speak is the primary tightening. The payoff—his grief reconfigured through the idea of “music,” her acceptance of what remains—is emotionally satisfying, but the conflict remains largely internal and never quite reaches a sharp dilemma or visible price beyond emotional exposure. For a quiet literary piece, the escalation is sufficient, though not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can meaningfully change his affliction and what framework of meaning he must adopt to do so—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates via visible worsening of the crystal with stress and the failure of scholarly methods, culminating in the risk-laden decision to abandon his training’s logic for a “foolish” superstition. The conflict is primarily internal but coherent and focused, and the micro-turn (reframing the quill as stylus, not pen) is a real narrowing of options. The cure itself arrives once he commits with relatively little resistance or complication, so the price and test of his commitment feel modest rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—delivering the apology before the house and orchard are destroyed—is established early and maintained consistently. Pressure escalates through the activation of the device and the overwhelming sensory/emotional deluge, culminating in Julian forcing out his apology under strain. However, there is little resistance or risk of outright failure once the ritual begins; the séance works on its first attempt and external obstacles are minimal. The cost is primarily internal, which is effective but keeps tension at a quiet, intimate scale.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—whether she remains a separate witness or dissolves into cosmic consensus—is clear but rarely feels in doubt. Pressure deepens conceptually (the redefinition of arbitration, recognition that the universe has “resolved itself”), yet the scene lacks concrete resistance or a meaningful alternative path. Her final act of letting the book fall and stopping her witnessing is a choice, but it’s not strongly tested on the page. As a result, tension is more philosophical than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the anomaly is a mechanical fault to correct or a deeper message to heed—is clear and tightens as he moves from vague dissonance to microscopic inspection to ontological shock. Escalation is largely internal and conceptual, suiting the mode, but the emotional and practical jeopardy remains relatively low-key (no strong external consequence to error). His final choice not to intervene is a real stance crystallization, foreclosing the path of absolute mastery. Slightly more explicit pressure on what he risks by leaving the flaw untouched would strengthen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will cling to or release this spectral echo of a loved one—is clear early and pays off in his choice to open a door that sends her away. Internal and external conflicts interweave well: his technical goal (permeable barriers) serves his emotional dilemma. Escalation is mostly internal and tonal rather than driven by concrete reversals; there’s little sense that failure would have a non-emotional cost, which keeps the pressure on the softer side. Still, his renunciation reads as a real price that forecloses a path, satisfying the core requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will remain bound to sterile certainty or risk entering her father’s ambiguous, intuitive world—is present early and resolved at the end. Pressure grows in an accumulative way as she repeatedly chooses to continue the “absurd” method, which effectively tests her worldview. However, the conflict rarely sharpens into concrete dilemmas or visible trade-offs; the weeks-long traverse pass without a specific on-page moment where continuing costs her something tangible. As a result, the final acceptance of “beautiful risk” feels persuasive but not heavily hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the caller’s “ending” can be reconfigured into a beginning—is clear and thematically rich, and the looping conversation provides a subtle form of escalation. Pressure accumulates texturally as the man’s narrative frays and reforms, culminating in his restated line about silence as a new sound. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and steady-state; there is no sharply legible tightening or concrete foreclosed option beyond the implied risk of self-harm, which stays offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether a forgotten, misread love can heal a generational feud—is clear and escalates from private curiosity to communal consequence. The chemical restoration and the walk to the contested jetty function as tightening beats that deepen both knowledge and the scale of implication. However, resistance is minimal: no one opposes Elara, and the miraculous blooming and Tomas’s synchronized arrival resolve pressure almost entirely via coincidence and grace rather than contested choice. The cost is conceptual and historical rather than dramatized through a hard present-tense dilemma, which keeps tension strong but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Silas’s loneliness and the broader social apathy versus his attempt to spark connection—is clear and tracked. Escalation hinges on the arrival of pilgrims and his choice whether to play the miracle-worker, reveal the rock, or step in as an ordinary, skilled man. The emotional stakes are legible, but the tension stays gentle; there’s little sense that his choice could go truly wrong beyond mild awkwardness. Still, the final stance (process over miracle, risk of real contact) constitutes a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Kaelen versus his own grief and the forest’s relentless sound—comes through, with the melody-building quest providing a clear spine. Internal stakes (can he find a bearable way to live with loss?) are strong and culminate in the final realization. However, escalation is gentle: the search proceeds in a relatively linear, untroubled way, and there’s no sharp test of commitment or visible sacrifice at any individual beat. The final step through the moss is more a natural culmination than a pressured choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether Kaelen will risk rewriting history to undo his catastrophic mistake or accept its irreversibility—is clear and tightened by the montage of alternate-disaster outcomes. His agency drives the escalation: each “nudge” produces new costs, forcing him toward a moral and existential decision. The price of his final refusal is palpable: he preserves the man formed by guilt rather than erasing him, sacrificing the fantasy of rescue. The conflict remains mostly internal and somewhat cleanly resolved, but the ethical calculus under pressure is robust for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elian can transform oppressive, forgetful silence into meaningful music—is clear and does escalate as he moves toward the “nexus” of forgetting. The shift from mapping to actively “arguing, pleading, demanding that the silence give up its dead” provides one solid tightening. However, resistance remains mostly atmospheric; the silence feels heavy and “aggressive” but never truly threatens his goal or forces a painful trade-off on the page. As a result, the climax is moving yet somewhat inevitable, with limited sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—salvaging Elara’s erased story and promise—is established early and escalates as the trail of clues culminates in the apparently desecrated self-portrait. Conflict is primarily internal (how to respond to erasure and theft) rather than external, with the sharpest turn when he resists the urge to rage and instead decodes and reframes the vandalism as part of the artwork. His final choice to complete the piece as testament is an earned resolution, but the pressure on that choice could be sharpened by one more on-page tension between revenge and preservation. The lack of a strong opposing force in the present timeline keeps the stakes a bit abstract at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can assert her and Leo’s dream against the facility’s erasure of grief—is established early and coherently pursued. Escalation comes through the intensifying drumming and corresponding deepening of the lagoon, culminating in the emotionally sharp recognition of both triumph and absence. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and unopposed; there’s no concrete external pressure or reversal once she’s in the lab, which keeps tension from reaching a truly gripping peak. The price is emotional rather than tactical and is felt but not heavily tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—professional and social authority in a high-tech port gone dark—is clear and credible. Pressure escalates from Kaelen’s public challenge and time pressure into the puzzle of XB-734’s hidden mechanism. Yet Silas encounters no serious setback or reversal; each obstacle yields quickly to his competence, so the sense of risk remains modest. As a result, the conflict is satisfying but not truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—easing a sentient darkness’s despair—is clear and escalates modestly as the presence “listens” and responds. However, Kaelen is never in danger, and no option with significant personal cost is visibly foreclosed; their success feels likely from the outset. The pressure rises atmospherically rather than through hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether communal imagination will succumb to Authority’s homogenizing prophecy—is clear and threads through the whole piece. Pressure does build: the proclamation, children’s anxiety, and the countdown to the ninth bell give the quiet rebellion a temporal focus. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided; no active counter-moves from the Authority or visible personal jeopardy for Elias appear on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a beautifully handled reveal than a truly tested, high-cost confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—freedom and true nature versus home, safety, and Elara—is clearly signaled and drives the movement toward the cove and the final separation. The key tightening is Elara’s emotional softening under the scrimshaw’s influence, which shifts her from opposition to pained consent. However, once she yields, pressure eases rather than intensifies, and the magical detachment unfolds without resistance or visible danger, muting the sense of risk. The resolution is earned but could benefit from one more concrete price or complication during the island’s awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining an inner life of grief under a regime that criminalizes it—is clear and poignant. Pressure deepens rather than sharply escalates: the memory of Mara’s abduction and his moral self-indictment (“he had simply watched”) weight his quiet rituals, and the decision to carve and place the bird is a small, defiant claiming of interior space. There’s no on-page confrontation with external enforcement, so threat remains conceptual rather than directly tested in scene. The conflict is compelling but operates on a low, steady simmer rather than tightening into a sharply narrowed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully engage with the supposedly maddening hum and derive a non-derivative “paraphrase”—is clear but largely internal. There is a discernible escalation as he progresses from observation to dissolution of self to realization, yet the sense of danger or potential failure (madness, rejection of his method, psychic overload) is only implied, not felt on the page. No antagonist or concrete opposing force presses back actively; the piece leans on atmosphere rather than friction. As a result, the final reconfiguration is satisfying but not tense.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lyra’s life/soul—is clear very early, and the demand for “a sound that is perfectly whole” tightens pressure in a focused way. Elian’s decision to use the concertina reed and Vex’s work to build the resonator serve as the main escalation beat and are directly tested in the final breath. What’s missing is real resistance: once the plan is proposed, nothing meaningful threatens to derail it, and no alternative or sacrifice is weighed. The barter’s acceptance arrives without a real risk of failure on the page, which slightly blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can recover the lost frequency of connection—is clear, and the hinge choice (rethinking assumptions and treating sound as something to “see”) is a genuine deepening. However, there is almost no real resistance once the new plan is in motion: the apparatus works on its first dramatized attempt, and the final tweak to the resonance matrix succeeds without complication. As a result, escalation feels more like an elegant demonstration of a solution than a pressured struggle with narrowing options or visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can help another person not be devoured by grief, and thereby reconfigure his own—is clear and present early (“to teach withering to bloom again”). Escalation comes through the sequence of origami-guided encounters, each deepening her engagement and culminating in the climactic, shared constellation projection. Pressure remains mostly internal and gentle; there’s little sense of what Elias truly risks if he fails or what he fears about stepping forward, which keeps the cost from fully biting. Still, his final act (revealing himself and repurposing Anya’s stencil) is an earned, if quiet, tightening of that stake.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is intellectual/emotional: Julian’s need to understand his ruin and Elara’s need to test her inherited theory. Conflict stays polite and internal; Julian offers little resistance, and Elara faces no real challenge to her framing. The main tightening is her decision to reveal her father’s work, but it doesn’t force a sharp trade-off or visibly heighten cost. As a result, tension is present but not deeply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can access forbidden knowledge without madness and what it will cost her identity—is clear and escalates as the ritual intensifies. Pressure deepens from risk of insanity to the larger horror of repeating the An-Korin’s self-erasure, culminating in her acceptance of becoming their vessel. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and somewhat one-directional; she never seriously tests an option other than completion, so we miss a sharp on-page trade-off or renunciation beat. Tension is sustained, but a more explicit moment of choice under duress would elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving Elara’s true self without erasing her pain—is clearly signaled early and deepens as he discovers the shadow is self-made rather than invasive. Escalation is primarily internal and cognitive: the real tightening comes when he realizes he cannot destroy the shadow without falsifying her, forcing an ethical trade-off. The integration sequence is his decisive action, with the visible cost of solidifying his own regret and preserving her sorrow. The piece leans contemplative, so tension never becomes acute, but for a quiet story the pressure is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can act from compassion without erasing his hurt—is clear and tied to the concrete task of repairing the chameleon’s tail. Pressure tightens as he moves from design to delicate fitting, with the animal’s tension and potential rejection adding a quiet but real risk. His internal conflict (anger and shame vs. care) is explicitly dramatized in the “shedding layers” sequence and resolved through action, not mere thought. The cost is mostly emotional and could be sharpened further, but it’s legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can finally erase his wound or must live with it—is clear from early on and tightens as he commits to “tunneling” despite the ivy’s interference. Pressure escalates credibly: what begins as a hoped-for miracle becomes a confrontation with an unhealed, perfectly preserved break plus collateral harm to the ivy. His final renunciation of “closure” in favor of carrying scars is a coherent Earned Stasis, foreclosing the fantasy of erasure. The tension is primarily interior and could feel even more acute with a sharper external counter-pressure (e.g., consequences of failing the procedure in his life outside the tower).

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will discover where unused love goes—appears early and is maintained, and the pressure does deepen as she shifts from Arthur himself to following the love’s path through projected light into the theater. The sense of emotional buildup (“a pressure building behind a dam”) provides a clear tightening consistent with the accumulative lens. However, there is almost no counterforce or risk of failure; once she begins the reading, the outcome feels inevitable, and her agency is largely limited to sustained attention rather than contested choice. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-friction conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—psychic static vs. the need for inner quiet and creative expression—is well signaled and sustained, and the anomalous meteor provides a meaningful deepening of pressure. However, the escalation is more conceptual than oppositional: the new understanding transforms the problem rather than forcing a difficult trade-off or visible loss. Her primary agency is endurance and reframing, which fits the mode but softens the sense of price paid. The shift to drawing people is a real change of tactic, yet it feels more like graceful solution than hard-earned compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—the integrity of the archive/world versus honoring a violently intrusive, precious memory—is clear and surfaces quickly once the pine-memory erupts. Escalation is present but relatively smooth: tremor → violent shuddering and risk to the dunes → delicate integration maneuver, with little sense of real possibility of failure or sacrifice beyond conceptual stakes. Kaelen’s agency drives the resolution via their choice of synthesis over erasure, aligning external and internal conflict. The pressure never feels trivial, but it also never quite tightens to a point where a painful trade-off or visible loss is unavoidable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding whether his nightly translocations have meaning or are random misfortunes—is clear and present from the start. Pressure does build texturally via the unknown “dialect” of the crystalline chimes and the intensifying “hum of insight,” culminating in a new understanding at the tree. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal sense of real risk or alternative outcomes beyond interpretive discomfort. As a result, escalation feels intellectually satisfying but somewhat low-tension in emotional or consequential terms.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will step into a new life after her “severing” or remain bound to the ghost-country of the past—is clearly implied. Pressure accrues gently through the ascent and the presentation of the ticket, culminating in her choice to walk the ridgeway alone. Yet there is little genuine escalation or narrowing of options; she never seriously entertains refusal, so the central conflict feels contemplative more than contested. The cost is present conceptually but could be more sharply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to flee safety or stay and face the moral cost of his silence—is clear early and tightens steadily. The key escalations are the stain-triggered memory, the explicit offer from the manager that he can leave, and his refusal followed by the bolt at the door. The cost of remaining in this shared, wordless guilt is legible, and his agency is expressed as endurance and a small, risky gesture rather than dramatic confrontation. Pressure is internal and quiet but coherent, with no false spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unmaking the pretender’s false legitimacy—is clear from early on, and the story tightens as Kael moves from preparatory history into the final act with the pellet at the nexus. However, there is little sense of risk or potential failure; the conflict is more ritualistic execution than contested struggle, with no credible reversals or live alternative paths. The cost is mainly Kael’s and the library’s dissolution, which lands conceptually but isn’t strongly dramatized as a wrenching loss. As a result, escalation feels elegant but somewhat low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will Aris unlock Lena’s pattern and make sense of disappearance—is signaled early and tightens convincingly around the rare environmental alignment. The beat where he fails, then notices the spiral and realizes the missing central rhythm, is a genuine escalation in both pressure and knowledge. Stakes remain largely internal and conceptual; the risk is more existential and emotional than materially perilous, which suits the piece but keeps intensity on the quieter side. The fleeting nature of the summoned reef supplies a real, if understated, sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can wake the stones and restart the rebellion’s heartbeat—is clear and escalates as her hum grows and the environment responds. The choice to reject brute-force technology in favor of harmony is structurally important and sets up a meaningful turn once the monoliths answer. However, resistance is mostly historical and conceptual; on the page, the process unfolds with little risk of failure, threat, or sacrifice, so tension feels more ceremonial than fraught. The result is a satisfying but relatively low-suspense conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—seeding a counter-destiny against an imposed, docile humanity—is clear and meaningful, and the unsealing ritual is a natural tightening. However, conflict is mostly conceptual and procedural; no antagonist or concrete obstacle presses back in scene, and failure never feels like a live possibility beyond “this is delicate.” The ending forecloses a path (pure compliance) but without a visible immediate price to Elara, so tension stays intellectual more than visceral. The piece would benefit from one sharp on-page risk or near-miss that tests her resolve or competence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central conflict—her ongoing trauma versus her need to function and nurture life—tightens credibly when the low-flying plane’s sound escalates into full-body paralysis. The stakes are intimate but high: whether she is ruled by the sky or can reclaim enough control to keep living her chosen life. Her agency manifests as endurance and deliberate attention rather than big external decisions, but the effortful shift from being trapped in flashback to watering the pine with “just enough” feels like a costly, tested stance. The only limitation is that pressure stays internal and could bear one more small external complication without losing the quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will be consumed by fragmentation or find a way to live with it—is clear. Pressure escalates modestly: the oppressive walls and failed canvases build to the tarot-box discovery, then to the pivotal decision “He would not mend the box; he would redesign it,” which crystallizes a new mode of engagement. His choice forecloses the path of nostalgia/repair and commits him to a slower, more arduous reconstruction, with cost acknowledged in the “long climb back up into the light.” The piece could gain from one sharper mid-scene test or moment of resistance before he fully embraces this method.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to understand crisis-time via the drone—is clear and his agency drives escalation from observation to self-erasure. The external pressures (rockslide, violated wildness, encroaching tech) are strong conceptually but stay mostly off to the side of his decision-making in the present scene. The cost (abandoning his people, risking an unknowable “between”) is implied but not viscerally dramatized beyond his calm resolve. Tension is steady and focused but doesn’t quite sharpen into a hard, agonized trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—truth versus social stability—is established early and sharpened by the upcoming “purity purge.” The pressure tightens as the story moves from discovery to a now-or-never decision framed as “within the blink that follows surprise,” culminating in her irreversible send. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and progresses in a fairly straight line, without a significant complication or reversal once she commits. The felt cost is present but could be more sharply dramatized in her risk calculus at the terminal.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will accept or refuse her violent heritage—is signaled early and tightened effectively once the knife is foregrounded. Escalation is primarily internal: sensory memory (“ozone and blood”), the weight of the knife, and the vast desert outside all converge to force an explicit stance. Her agency is clear in the decision to sheath and entomb the knife instead of destroying or wielding it, with visible cost in the closed-off future. The conflict remains mostly contemplative rather than feeling immediately perilous, which keeps pressure just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the goddess’s echo on a dangerous, one-night-only venture—is clearly signaled and the move into the silent hollow is a meaningful tightening. However, once he engages, resistance is minimal: his calm and abilities handle each obstacle without serious jeopardy or trade-off, so escalation feels smooth rather than sharp. The “impossible task” of voicing silence is solved on the first attempt, further reducing perceived risk. The universe re-stabilizes at the end, but the story does not foreground a specific price he pays, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Celeste versus the journalist’s damning narrative about her father—is clear and focused, with the phone confrontation as a concrete site of pressure. Her “proof by contradiction” line of questioning is a genuine tightening that forces the journalist into a new understanding. However, the stakes stay largely intellectual/emotional; there’s little sense of what concrete fallout or risk she faces if she fails beyond legacy and memory, which mutes the sense of cost. Still, escalation from passive recipient to active challenger is well executed.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can give his daughter’s digitized anguish an ending and quiet his guilt—is clear and escalates once the firmware’s translation appears. The text stream’s shift from terror to curiosity as he works gives a solid sense of pressure changing under his agency. The main weakness is that the solution (scratching a constellation into live circuitry with amber) arrives without resistance or failure; there’s little sense he might not succeed. Still, emotional cost is legible in his confrontation with Lyra’s cry and the relinquishing of his hum.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—how to respond to a world where words and axioms have failed—remains mostly internal and situational, with Elara’s decision to “interject” via the mandala serving as the key turn. The stakes are conceptual (meaning vs void) rather than visceral, and escalation is gentle: others gradually gather and focus, but no real alternative path or sharp trade-off is dramatized. Tension is well sustained at the atmospheric level, especially in the “soundless scream” sense of the hush. The resolution is earned but relatively low-pressure, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether ending unbearable trauma via identity erasure is an acceptable mercy—is clear and present from early on. Escalation is mostly procedural (preparing the tessera, channeling energy, pushing toward the core and renaming) rather than confrontational, but the tension of “final, most delicate action” and the man’s rigid, silent battle provides a credible tightening. What’s missing is an on-page test of Kaelen’s resolve or a genuine threat of failure; his success feels assured, so cost is more conceptual than suspenseful. The end beat’s “work not done” broadens scope but doesn’t introduce new personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains in despair or reclaims some sense of forward motion—is clear, and Julian’s goal to prevent a “tragic encore” provides a focused throughline. Escalation is largely a matter of intensifying sensory echoes, culminating in the overwhelming applause, which works emotionally but presents minimal resistance or complication; nothing meaningfully fights back. Elara’s agency is limited—she is mostly a respondent to Julian’s efforts—so the central conflict skews toward a one-sided rescue rather than a contested struggle. The price of success, for either character, remains soft and somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Elias’s need for empirical proof versus his fear of invalidating Lena’s belief—is clear and sharpened by the experiment. Escalation from first image (funeral grief) to the high-stakes second test (static shock love) is well handled, with the second exposure framed as “the real test.” The price he pays is primarily internal (cracking his skepticism) and relational (risking being wrong in either direction), which is felt but somewhat underplayed on the page. A slightly more concrete sense of what he stands to lose if this fails would increase pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—contacting and mapping the truly unknown consciousness of the cave—is clear and tightens as emotional residues intensify into an overwhelming, uncategorizable field. There is a meaningful deepening when she chooses to stop merely recording and actively participate, letting go of analytic control to merge. However, the story soft-pedals danger or conflict: she never appears genuinely torn or at risk, so the levitation/merger feels transformative but not perilous. The result is a beautifully textured escalation that lacks a strong sense of potential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen will obey the Founders’ doom-cycle or act on a new understanding—is signaled early and tightens as the sand runs low and the voices cohere. The decisive beat is strong: the last grain falls, silence, and instead of turning the glass he leaves with the map and jar. Conflict is primarily internal and situational, but it’s well interwoven with the external ticking clock and inherited duty. A slightly more acute sense of what he risks (e.g., punishment, collapse) on the page would sharpen the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—atoning for a deadly hesitation by risking himself to save the colleague—is clear early and explicitly tightened when Kestrel reveals she’s alive and hunted. That revelation transforms the abstract desire to “fix what’s broken” into a concrete, time-sensitive mission, giving the snow code and pillbox new weight. Escalation is largely internal and situational; there’s no on-page confrontation, but the choice to step back into a hostile network after being burned is legibly costly. The limit is that antagonistic pressure is entirely off-stage, so tension never quite peaks beyond a poised, contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to his broken promise and whether it will remain a source of corrosive guilt or be metabolized into something livable. Pressure coherently builds via the sonic pattern (drip → hammering → silence) and his deepening attempt to “distill” the memory. The meaningful turn is his realization that the promise has transmuted into a quiet ethic of care, and the cost is accepting that “coming back” in the literal sense is gone. The escalation is subtle and largely internal, which keeps it just under the top band for stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—whether and how this place “resists change”—with the pressure escalating via intensifying sensory phenomena (thrum → hum → full overlay) as he commits to more substantial acts of care. His agency clearly drives the key turn: moving from passive observation to strenuous, time-costly repair of the irrigation channel. However, the on-page cost is gentle (skipped meal, forgotten night) and there is little sense of risk or meaningful alternative paths, so tension stays low. The piece functions more as a deepening meditation than as a conflict-driven arc, which is effective but limits this category.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is quiet but coherent: Elara versus the opacity of Mr. Henderson’s solitude and her own reluctance to intrude. Stakes are emotional and scaled to the length—whether she can create even the smallest response without violating her “protected vulnerability.” Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-based, with the nightly repetition under worsening cold functioning as the tightening, and the slit in the blinds as a modest but decisive shift. The cost is present (time, discomfort, the risk of caring without reciprocation), though it remains understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will be crushed or stabilized by his returning life—is signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates from sporadic shards to a terrifying full immersion in memory, with the key tightening being his choice to risk the library’s heart and submit to the hum. The resolution is internally driven (acceptance/coexistence) and feels earned, but the sense of potential failure or real psychic danger could be sharpened to increase tension. The conflict pays off but resolves a bit smoothly for the level of dread initially implied.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain a separate archivist or risk joining the web—is signaled early and narrowed as she watches others add their tokens. Pressure escalates primarily through internal comparison and the sacred transformation of the installation under sunlight, which tips her toward action. The decisive act (placing the nest) clearly forecloses the option of hoarding her “last link” and so has cost, albeit in a contemplative rather than urgent register. The conflict is compelling but stays quite smooth; one sharper snag or competing pull in the present scene could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can blunt the tricksters’ manipulative influence on an already-dividing community—is articulated early and stays coherent. Pressure escalates from general social fracturing to a “particularly virulent” transmission tied to a specific violent event, then to the live standoff on the quad as she initiates her counter-signal. Her agency drives the turn: activating the sequence is the key choice, and the partial success (a few protestors’ fury softening) is a credible, scaled payoff. Still, the price she pays is mainly anxiety and exhaustion; no substantive option is sharply foreclosed, which keeps the conflict effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—facing the mutinous nexus and his claustrophobia to recover the “key”—are signaled early and escalated effectively when the organ enrages the structure instead of soothing it. The walls closing in and the passage stretching to infinity provide a genuine tightening of options. His climactic agency (using the compass on the keystone at the peak vibration) resolves both the external threat and his internal fear in a way that feels earned. The cost is primarily psychic/endurance rather than a visible loss, keeping this just shy of the strongest band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can access genuine empathy via this ritual—is signaled early and carried through to closure. Pressure escalates texturally as he moves from sketching stone to mist to ribbon, culminating in the violent incision in the canvas. However, the internal conflict is relatively low-friction: his process never seriously falters or threatens to fail, so the sense of risk or potential loss feels muted. The final shift is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias will expose a buried continent and his ancestor’s erasure—is clear and meaningfully escalates from archival curiosity to a quasi-ritual field mission and institutional challenge. His decision to leave the station and physically perform the keying act at the rock is a solid tightening beat. However, the journey and rite unfold almost frictionlessly: no environmental hazard, moral bind, or institutional pushback on the page. As a result, the stakes read more intellectually than viscerally, limiting the sense of price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elias remains trapped in his “never” life or commits to pursuing an impossible door—and this is signaled clearly. Pressure escalates as he decodes the mesh and reinterprets Lyra’s disappearance, culminating in his decision to align his music with the code. However, there is minimal resistance or competing obligation, and no external counterforce; tension operates mostly as wonder rather than as conflict. As a result, the final choice is meaningful but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary stake—Elias preserving his sanctuary without becoming his father—is clear and the pressure grows logically from surveyors to full construction to personal visit from the CEO. His agency drives the main turn: choosing symbolic/psychological warfare instead of direct confrontation, forcing a CEO-level escalation and then retreat. However, the external cost to Elias is fairly light on the page, and the startup’s actual implosion is outsourced to off-page market forces, so the sense of escalating risk and price is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The internal ethical cost of his manipulations is suggested but not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elian can transform an inherited, consuming mystery into meaning—is clear and present early. Pressure accumulates through his sense of last-resort weariness into the dream experiment, which provides the decisive deepening of knowledge. However, opposition is largely internal and somewhat soft; once he initiates the lucid process, success feels foregone, with little on-page risk of failure or cost beyond fatigue and long-term obsession. The resolution is satisfying but would gain power from at least one concrete setback or sharper test of his resolve in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes—retrieving his final words and ending the curse versus preserving her own guardedness and life force—are clear and escalate as she pushes from reeds to water to vortex. The psychic scream and the branch’s resistance provide a meaningful tightening, forcing her to expend “every ounce of her life force” and risk cracking her emotional fortress. The final conflict turn is credible and character-driven: she chooses to unbend the branch and then symbolically to seed new, dangerous life in its place. The cost is more emotional than physical on the page, but it’s palpably felt.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—finding a true intersection/path to begin re-weaving reality, and rescuing Kael from a false, annihilating peace—is legible and present early. Pressure escalates once Kael’s “beautiful trap” warning arrives and Elara must choose to reject that apparent solution and force a new vector using the clipping’s logic. However, opposition is largely atmospheric rather than active, and she succeeds on the first articulated attempt without serious setback or visible personal loss beyond effort and risk. The conflict reads more as a successful calibration problem than a hard-won, costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris can protect and nurture his sister’s soul-tree against the void he created—is clear from early on and is given one solid escalation when the shadow-tendril threatens to choke the sapling. His choice not to “punch a hole” but to fill it with his own lost-destiny memory is a genuine narrowing of options with evident cost, integrating internal and external conflict. Tension is quiet but sustained; there’s no false intensity or easy fix, just a single, meaningful test of his method. The escalation ceiling is limited mainly by the small scope: we never doubt his willingness to sacrifice, so the moral calculus, while affecting, carries less surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to live sealed in “facts” or reengage with a painful past—is clear and coherent. Escalation is internal but legible: the snagged cloth and recorder create a small physical struggle that catalyzes a much larger emotional confrontation, culminating in his choice to preserve the cloth as “evidence.” The cost is subtle but real: accepting that detachment isn’t total, that the “shipwreck” still matters. The conflict could feel sharper if there were one more beat where he almost discards or misclassifies the item before relenting.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether death is erasure or transition, and whether their shared belief in an ordered cosmos still holds—remains largely internal and philosophical. Pressure does accumulate as she moves from mourning to active experiment, with one clear tightening when she commits to planting the seed at the arbor’s central node, but there is little sense of risk, trade-off, or potential loss beyond continued grief. The luminous sprout arrives without resistance or complication, so her hypothesis is affirmed rather than tested under strain. As a result, escalation feels modest rather than gripping, even for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelan can transform trapped, chaotic memory into peaceful wonder—is coherent and the tide-driven shift into the Smelter persona is a clear escalation. However, there is no real sense that Kaelan might refuse, fail, or pay a new price; the ritual feels inevitable and uncontested. The pain of holding contradictory emotions is mentioned but not sharpened into a concrete risk or trade-off in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding isolation vs risking it to reconnect humanity—is clear and tightened as Elias moves from observer to saboteur. The key escalation is his walk from the conch to the crystal pillar and the “heartbeat of a hesitation,” where his oath and fear of catastrophe contend with his desire to broadcast hope. The final act is unambiguously his agency and resolves the central dilemma. Stakes remain somewhat high-level and symbolic (no concrete scenario of fallout is sketched), which keeps the tension more cerebral than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconfigure his relationship to his brother’s death and his own guilt—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure builds from restless searching to the jolt of the graffiti’s message and then to the renunciatory act of setting down the accordion, which forecloses a familiar burden. The conflict is largely internal and quiet, with no major external complication or reversal beyond the discovery of the message. That subtlety is effective, but the escalation feels more linear than tightening, keeping this just below the strongest band.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can retrieve the truth of his unspoken feelings before the second letter fixes a lie—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates as she decodes increasingly intimate phrases and moves toward the “central chamber,” with the watch’s frantic tick and the library’s dissolving providing a temporal squeeze. However, conflict is primarily internal and conceptual; there’s limited on-page pushback or genuine risk of failure beyond the ticking clock. The cost is implied more than dramatized, which softens the impact at an elite-venue standard.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—keep serving the Empire’s narrative or risk everything for a truer, living future—is introduced early and sharpened by the plant memory and coffee prophecy. Pressure escalates from quiet professional duty to moral treason, culminating in a concrete, irrevocable act (taking the cutting and filing a damning report). However, all antagonistic force is offstage; no one pushes back in the moment, so escalation remains mostly internal rather than contested. The ethical calculus is strong, but the scene lacks a second vector of active resistance that might raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can capture one last perfect spark before oblivion—exists but is only lightly pressured. The search for the right memory and the act of infusing provide a gentle tightening, yet there’s no serious sense that she might fail, or that failure would cost her anything beyond abstract duty. Conflict remains primarily procedural and internalized as craft, with no credible reversal or trade-off. This makes the piece feel more like a ritual depiction than a story under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elara will remain a non-interfering observer or risk intervening in the sacred cycle—comes through, and her choice does shift her role. However, the pressure is gentle: there’s little sense of what might go wrong, no substantial pushback from tradition, and the intervention works immediately. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth slide into the right answer than a genuinely costly or contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen will ruin his partner under the banner of certainty—emerges early and stays coherent. Pressure escalates from exhausted post-confession talk to a ritualized confrontation via chimes and mirror, culminating in the physical unhooking of the cloak as a clear narrowing of options. The cost is internal and ethical rather than externalized, but the story makes that felt through posture, gesture, and the change in the chimes’ harmony. A slightly sharper sense of what concrete consequences his revenge would entail could have intensified the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s ability to learn the art that might help him find his sister—is established early and tied to his psychic loudness in the universe. Escalation is primarily internal, via the trance and the reversal of the ripples, which functions as a single meaningful deepening of pressure. However, tension remains contemplative; there’s little sense that something vital could be lost in this moment beyond frustration and a delayed path to mastery. The conflict is resonant but soft-edged compared to what elite venues often expect.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stake—releasing a trapped regret and confirming Kaelan’s navigational art—comes through clearly, and the chaotic flock provides a meaningful escalation. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: there’s little sense that Kaelan might misread, fail, or be harmed by the attempt, so tension remains subdued. The resolution is beautifully handled but arrives without any visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative path. As a result, the conflict is satisfying yet not strongly pressurized by elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can understand the keystone and, by extension, his own worth outside automated creativity—is clear and coherent. Escalation comes from repeated diagnostic failures and the overload of his tools, sharpening his internal crisis and driving the decisive act of unstrapping the pack. The external conflict is relatively mild and the danger low-key, so tension stays more contemplative than gripping. Still, the internal trade-off between safety in convention and vulnerable, tool-less encounter is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he will risk the deep to fulfill an old, almost impossible promise—is clear and steadily intensified from routine lamplighting to the eerie, silent library where he turns off his own torch. The key tightening comes when he chooses to float in total darkness and let memory of music replace sight, which narrows his options to an inward confrontation. However, external danger and concrete jeopardy are lightly sketched rather than dramatized, so the price of failure or harm never fully bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will risk everything (and his sanity) to chase a stubborn pattern in hopes of aligning with cosmic purpose—is signaled early and sharpened by the threat of burning out the sensors. Pressure escalates from abstract static to a full-station commitment to power, through hours of apparent failure, to the surprising emergence of the old-universe echo. The internal conflict between doubt and belief is intertwined with that external risk. The price remains more conceptual than visceral, but it is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can contour his grief into something bearable—is signaled early and honored throughout, with the ritual as a concrete test. Pressure escalates modestly via the time constraint of the setting sun and the build-up of physical/psychic tension as he channels the echo. The cost is clear but interior: he accepts an imperfect, fractured relic instead of impossible restoration. The conflict stays primarily internal and contemplative, so while effective for this mode, it never quite tightens into a sharp dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can this almost powerless man meaningfully nudge a dead world—is clear and coherently pressured by his repeated failure and dwindling daily strength. The meaningful tightening comes when he shifts focus to the silence between drips and risks his remaining magic on one more adjustment. Cost (utter exhaustion, the tiny rather than grand result) lands, but the conflict remains mostly internal and meditative, with minimal on-page resistance in the moment of action. A brief, concrete setback or near-miss during this specific attempt would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the town’s ossified lie about the great-uncle will stand or be rewritten—is clear early and steadily intensified. Conflict escalates from curiosity to obsession to a morally charged choice to alter official history, with the decisive pressure focused on how he will revise the ledger. Internal and external stakes braid effectively: personal loyalty, family legacy, and communal memory converge on the act of correction. What holds this just below the top tier is the largely off-stage nature of opposition; the social and relational costs are implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can move past purely logical alchemy into a fuller, riskier mode of knowing—is established early and sharpened by his growing frustration and sense of entrapment. Pressure escalates when he abandons his tools and commits to the starlings method, a meaningful surrender of control that narrows his available tactics. The final choice to treat the crystal not as a substance but a focal point, and to offer flame as reverent energy, is a credible culmination of that arc. The on-page cost remains mainly internal and conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, keeping tension more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—quietly redirecting a dangerous migratory route to protect the inner colonies without causing panic—is clear and introduced early. Pressure escalates plausibly from cognitive shock (patterns wrong) to tactical difficulty (recalibrating without an alert) to physical risk (trembling hand over a fragile, irreplaceable dial). Kael’s agency drives the turn through his improvised power diversion and the muscle-memory tactic. The cost is mostly internal and atmospheric rather than sharply dramatized, which mutes the peak slightly but remains effective at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will be allowed (or dare) to vivify the duplicate against Jin’s ideological opposition—is established early and escalates coherently. The act of placing his hands on the jar and proceeding despite Jin’s protests is a solid tightening and the energy build functions as a climax. However, Jin’s resistance collapses quickly into mesmerized observation, softening external pressure and making the conflict feel somewhat one-sided in the peak beat. The internal cost (drain sensation, new responsibility) is present but comparatively subtle for the scale of the metaphysical act.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central pressure—how Elias will frame and respond to an uncanny, possibly grotesque gift—is conceptually strong but under-escalated on the page. Once he identifies the seed and associates it with Finch, there’s little genuine friction; planting it is treated as almost foregone rather than a choice with competing pulls (safety, intrusion, odor, long-term burden). The story deepens the idea of a long, living puzzle but doesn’t quite stage a tightening where a real alternative is live and then relinquished. As a result, the stakes feel thoughtful but relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—piercing a house’s ossified grief—is clear and materializes in the attempt to turn silence into a communicative roar. Escalation is present in the repeated pulls, the engine’s cough, then full-throated scream, and finally the wife stepping into the hallway and recognizing the tune. The conflict is more internal/emotional than antagonistic, but the tension between his limited agency and the family’s numbness is coherent. The visible price is modest (a tear and painful nostalgia rather than cathartic rupture), which slightly softens the sense of high-stakes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—escape homesickness vs. remain guardian—is clear early through his waiting and deepens when the pendant offers a specific, dangerous route home. Escalation is clean: from intrusion, to pendant’s temptation, to the violently opened portal demanding a choice. The external and internal conflicts interweave effectively in the final beat, where his decision both protects the library and forecloses his personal escape. Stakes remain somewhat intimate/abstract rather than viscerally perilous, but for this scale the moral/emotional price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can break his assigned mediocrity by eliciting new magic from the crozier—is clearly established and escalates as he consumes more of the relic, culminating in the irreversible use of the “shepherd’s crook itself.” The meaningful tightening comes when he realizes his approach mirrors the Guild’s coercive philosophy and chooses a radically different tactic, paying with the crozier’s complete dissolution. Internal and external conflicts are well woven, though the opposition remains conceptual (dogma/control) rather than embodied in another character, which keeps the pressure effective but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict—extracting order from cosmic noise on a singularly high-pressure night—is clearly framed, and the perigee plus the fragment’s volatility provide a credible escalation. Her despair and the system’s threat of overload do tighten pressure leading into her decisive methodological change. However, the stakes stay largely intellectual and professional; there’s no serious sense of harm, loss, or irreversible consequence if she fails beyond disappointment. As a result, the final success, while earned, doesn’t feel like it’s purchased at a meaningful price.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—returning the ferry and its people from the rupture—is clear and escalates from eerie displacement to existential risk as Finn grasps the seam between timelines. Pressure tightens when he recognizes he must actively merge realities rather than simply call for rescue, and he takes agency via the radio-pattern symphony. However, the conflict remains relatively straightforward: there’s little sense of competing goods or meaningful alternatives, which flattens potential moral or emotional stakes. The cost is more conceptual (his isolated awareness) than dramatically contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can “discover the texture of connection” without losing himself—is clear and grows as the altered memory threatens the stability of both his lattice and his past. Pressure escalates when he chooses to incorporate the coldness instead of resisting, driving the pattern into something “more dangerous” and precipitating the eruption. The cost at the end (his workshop becoming a cage and his connection texture being “terribly, terribly cold”) is legible and resonant. The one limitation is agency: he rarely confronts a live alternative path; the conflict is rich but somewhat foregone rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the city will remain a closed, seafloor-bound civilization or begin reorienting toward the stars—is clearly signaled. Pressure does escalate from private obsession to public confrontation, with the discovery of the “cosmic shorelines” as the key deepening beat. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual; the council’s resistance is gestured at more than dramatized, and there’s no genuine reversal or felt trade-off beyond rhetorical positioning. The result is thoughtful but relatively low-tension, more persuasive address than crucible, which keeps stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo will remain crushed by self-blame or accept the grandmother’s peace—is clear and focused. Pressure escalates effectively as the pulses shift from frantic to lullaby, creating a concrete external sign of internal stakes and giving Elias a clear task pivot from finding to assuring. The conflict is largely internal and resolved via calm conversation rather than a difficult trade-off, so the perceived cost is modest. Nonetheless, the tightening from search to intimate reassurance, then release, is clean and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear but primarily spiritual/emotional: granting peace to trapped consciousnesses and resolving a familial/ethical obligation. The hallway collapse and Elias’s claustrophobia provide a strong, concrete pinch point that forces a meaningful change of tactic through phase transition. However, after that beat the path to the console is relatively unresisted, and the insertion of the fleck functions almost like a key in a lock with no real chance of failure or visible price beyond strain. The temporal and physical dangers heralded early could press harder against his goal to heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—salvaging wisdom from Aris’s failure and, by extension, from her own liminal existence—is clear and present. Pressure builds mainly through duration and repetition: “for hours” of meaningless patterns until the sudden coalescence, then the brief, fragile connection that collapses. This gives one solid tightening, but there’s little sense of risk, cost, or alternatives foreclosed beyond continued isolation and fatigue. The conflict remains largely conceptual and meditative, which is effective but not strongly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can extract a single true word from the overwhelming noise to prove the language lives on—is clear and threads from start to finish. Pressure escalates credibly when the starlings’ pattern finally matches his need and he must act in that narrow window to align the diamond. However, opposition is largely environmental and technical, with minimal sense of what he loses if he fails beyond continuation of the status quo; risk feels conceptual rather than embodied. The result is real but relatively quiet tension, effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Julian will expose or protect this place, and by extension reject or honor Clara’s chosen state—is legible from early on and sharpens as he witnesses the client’s transformation. Pressure escalates through one clear deepening: the abstract suspicion of monstrosity is replaced by the concrete, morally complex ritual, forcing a more difficult choice. His agency at the end (setting down the phone, leaving the arrowhead, redefining his “job”) clearly forecloses prior goals with cost, even though the conflict is primarily internal and quiet. The scene could accommodate one more concrete external pressure or consequence, but it doesn’t feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—liberating the orchard from mechanized control—is legible early and escalates when the Wardens shift from patrol to charge. Elara’s choice to continue playing under threat is an authentic tightening, and her agency drives the solution. However, the resistance proves relatively one-sided; the Wardens are quickly overpowered, and Elara pays little visible price beyond exhaustion. The conflict is satisfying but lacks a sharper sense of possible failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—illegally reuniting a family with their daughter’s digital ghost by slipping past an automated border—is strong and clearly signaled. Pressure tightens as the countdown, drone hum, and uncorking of the bottle converge, and Elias’s agency directly drives the turn. However, once the plan is in motion there’s no additional complication or narrowing of options; the drones never almost catch him, and his internal fear remains subdued, so the sense of risk peaks more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to silence: whether he remains purely a caretaker of stillness or risks breaking it by giving it voice. Pressure escalates through the discovery of the fragment and his decision to crown the mare, culminating in the gust-and-bells moment that prompts the song. However, conflict is mostly implicit and contemplative; we get little on-page resistance or articulated fear when he chooses to sing after a decade of muteness. The result is a satisfying but relatively soft escalation that could carry more explicit cost in the decision itself.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—contacting “the place where stories live” and reawakening the scarf’s memory—builds coherently to the experiment and brief success. There is a meaningful tightening when the environment begins to warp and the vision appears, followed by a comedown that leaves him changed in knowledge but not in circumstance. However, opposition and cost remain mild: there’s no real threat, moral tension, or hard trade-off, only the frustration and awe of partial success. The result is a pleasing but relatively low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming or reconstituting the runaway dream—is clear and consistently pressed, with a meaningful escalation when the unprecedented foggy sunrise appears as a possible final chance. Pressure is primarily internal and textural rather than antagonistic; there’s no counterforce beyond time, repetition, and his own hollowing, so the escalation feels quiet rather than acute. His agency in seizing that morning and then choosing to “vitalize” the light does pay off, but the sense of concrete risk or trade-off in the climax is relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the son’s trapped masterpiece can be freed—is clear and emotionally legible from early on. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: once twilight comes, the ritual proceeds without real resistance or complication from the “fear” that supposedly guards the music. The Locksmith never has to adapt or pay a visible price; he applies his method and it works on the first try. The emotional tension is present but rarely escalates beyond expectation into genuine uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain an observer or risk interference to regain memory—is clearly signaled and escalates in a focused way. The key tightening is the anomalous Fae signature, which forces him to choose between his professional rule and personal need. However, the external danger or consequence of touching Fae magic remains mostly implied, so the price of escalation feels modest. The tension is strong but primarily internal and could benefit from one more beat of visible risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and when to attempt return from exile—is clear and steadily pressured by the risks embodied in the shadow-cube and Kael’s failure history. Tension escalates via the tea-leaf ritual, as Kael uncovers specific prices (“forget the face of your mother,” false hope as trap), making the prospect of return more dangerous and psychologically costly. Elara’s ultimate refusal to act on the map provides a meaningful Earned Stasis: she chooses endurance and rebuilding over escape. The conflict remains mostly internal and could benefit from one sharper external pinch, but it still coheres under a situational/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the “color of wonder” against encroaching greyness—is clearly articulated, and Elian’s ritual is structurally the climactic attempt to resolve it. Yet pressure never meaningfully escalates: there is no risk of failure, interruption, or internal doubt once he begins the process. The act of capturing essence proceeds smoothly from intention to complete success without complication, so options never feel narrowed. As a result, the ending is satisfying in image but relatively low in tension and price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the spirits’ chaos from unraveling the sanctuary/world—is stated clearly, and the on-page task of untying a single sailor’s knot functions as a focused test of that larger duty. Tension does escalate as the narrator works: the sanctuary’s unrest sharpens, the knot resists, and the release brings a tangible shift in pressure. However, the ritual proceeds without serious risk of failure or meaningful reversal, and the world-ending stakes never quite localize into a visceral sense of danger beyond mood. The main cost is fatigue and the daunting scale of work, which reads as real but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary stake—can she “reopen the mystery” and decode what was meant to be silent—is clear and internally coherent, and tension accumulates as she scrutinizes the films until the lichen discontinuity appears. The investigation beat (film comparison) is a meaningful tightening that changes her options and knowledge. However, the pressure remains contemplative; there’s little sense of risk in success or failure beyond professional/epistemic stakes, and no sharp trade-off is forced on the page. The final choice to acknowledge rather than repair the tear carries a conceptual price but not a strongly dramatized one.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to disturb or preserve this engineered sanctuary and, by extension, how to “let go”—is clear and coheres throughout. Escalation comes mainly through revelation: identifying the echo, uncovering the globe, then reading the note that reframes everything and forces a stance. The renunciation at the end (leaving the globe) is a real foreclosure of a path, with conceptual and emotional cost. However, conflict stays largely contemplative; there’s minimal on-page resistance or competing impulse in the moment of decision, which slightly softens the sense of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—briefly alleviating Lyra’s loneliness and preserving her consciousness—is clear and tied to a concrete task that must be completed between lightning and thunder. Pressure escalates through the closing of that temporal window and the moment of apparent failure before the glyphs ignite. However, the risk feels more like emotional disappointment than a sharp, potentially altering loss; there’s little suggestion of irrevocable degradation or a last-chance attempt. As a result, tension is present and sustained but never fully sharpens into a genuinely fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will uncover and what he will do with Elara’s hidden joy—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure deepens meaningfully when the goggles resolve the script and then again with the discovery of the child’s sketch; each step narrows his emotional options and moral responsibility. However, the conflict stays largely contemplative, with no serious on-page possibility that he will abandon the search or share the secret, so the sense of risk is muted. The final choice to protect the secret is right for the piece but lands more as quiet fulfillment than hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure is quiet but present: his need to find proof of Lena’s presence in the atmosphere builds as he moves from one emotional cloud to another. The stakes are intimate and conceptual—can he validate his belief and transform grief into meaning—and they do intensify at the moment of recognizing her doodle-fractal writ in cloud. However, conflict remains largely non-oppositional, with no serious threat to his aim or alternative path he might be forced to consider, which keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—completing the guild’s last and greatest work before the building comes down—is clear early, and the external pressure of the wrecking crew’s return provides a genuine tightening. Her agency matters: she must decode the coin, manipulate the intricate lock, and choose to press the stone into the heartwood. However, there are no real reversals or setbacks; once she begins, each step unfolds without complication, so the sense of risk and price remains more atmospheric than viscerally felt. The cost of her likely death or entombment is implied rather than directly tested in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can decode the sky to find the stranded luminance—is clear and pursued throughout. Pressure escalates from quiet frustration at its absence to interpretive urgency once he realizes the hopscotch pattern is temporal and the starlings are a code. However, the conflict remains largely cerebral and unopposed; there’s no real risk of loss beyond disappointment, so options never feel sharply foreclosed. The final success is earned by his attention and persistence, but it lacks a visible price or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—repairing the Orrery and, by extension, restoring both library and self—is clearly signaled and resolved by Elara’s choices, particularly uncapping the vial and choosing the correct gear. Pressure escalates when the blinding light and multiplied failures make error feel overwhelming, creating one meaningful tightening. However, there is no real reversal or significant risk of loss; success arrives on her first on-page attempt with no failed try or credible threat of catastrophe. As a result, tension is present but not bracing at the elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes—continued survival and eventual escape—are clear early and stay coherent, with pressure tightening from scavenging to deciphering messages to executing an “impossible” climb on a deadline. The climb sequence reads as the main escalation, but the physical and emotional costs are underplayed; there’s little sense of real risk beyond the word “treacherous.” The decision to trust the messages rather than dismissing them functions as the key internal tension, but resistance (e.g., Kaelen’s doubt) is only lightly pressed. The resolution is earned causally, yet could benefit from a sharper on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elias can complete this last act of consolation before the final ripple erases everything—are clear and thematically scaled rather than melodramatically dramatized. Pressure technically escalates: the lighthouse begins to thrum, he initiates the complex translation, energy drains, and the pane dissolves as the “tide” arrives. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and largely settled from the outset; we never sense a real possibility of refusal, failure, or catastrophic miscalculation. The result is poignant but low-friction tension: the piece deepens rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving a lost traveler before frost and mechanical birds kill them—is clear and signaled early. Time pressure and environmental threat escalate tension, and the frost’s arrival as he finishes the beacon gives a credible tightening. However, after he decides to help, opposition is mostly procedural; there’s little on-page risk of failure or reversal during the assembly itself. The cost is there (expenditure of the nut, attritional emotional toll) but the conflict never quite bites as hard as the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can Aris transform his guilt-rigid worldview into a form that allows connection with his divergent daughter—is clear early (“He was here to atone”) and tightens as he confronts the chrysalis and river. Pressure escalates conceptually when the foam’s behavior forces him to confront the failure of his “rigid, stable polymers” approach to life and parenting. His agency takes the form of an internal renunciation and a new stance (celebration rather than apology) that forecloses his old controlling path. Because the conflict remains entirely internal and contemplative, it never reaches the visceral sharpness it might in a more dramatized interaction, but within mode it works.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal and conceptual—Elian’s need to understand where stories begin—but it’s present from the outset and deepens as his mapping of absences leads him to the absolute void of the central tree. Escalation is modest but real: his increasingly precise engagement with absence culminates in a transgressive act (damaging perfection) rather than mere observation. His agency at the climax is clear—he chooses to create a flaw and commit to a beginning—but the sense of risk or sacrifice is soft; nothing visibly fights back or might be ruined by his choice. As a result, tension is more contemplative than visceral, which suits the piece but keeps stakes from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Kaelen will continue merely smoothing sorrows or accept the cost of ending them—is signaled early and escalates convincingly from individual burdens to a millennia-deep reservoir. The act of opening his senses and pulling the motes into himself is a clear, high-cost choice that forecloses his prior way of living. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, though the peak could benefit from slightly more felt risk of failure or refusal. Overall, tension builds in an accumulative, pressurized way consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring communal psychic harmony—is clear and present early, and the middle beat where the cacophony “fights back” and the weight trembles provides a real, if brief, tightening. Elias’s decisive dial adjustment serves as the key agency moment that resolves the pressure. Still, the conflict never feels close to failure; there’s limited sense of what he might lose or how his tactics could backfire, so escalation reads more elegant than harrowing. The resolution, while satisfying, comes a bit too smoothly for truly high-stakes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can safely rewrite her mind to preserve a lost dream—is clear and escalates from preparation to immersion to internal struggle. The middle turn (“entangled memories fought back…threatening to pull her under”) effectively deepens pressure by shifting from observation to existential risk. However, the conflict resolves quickly into “Then, silence,” with limited sense of a narrowed choice or trade-off made at the edge, so the price feels more asserted than fully dramatized. Tension is steady and engaging but could do more to test her values under genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—retrieving a perilous intellectual “combination” before the Inversion ends and the cavern becomes lethal again—are clear and escalate plausibly with the ticking clock and environmental danger. His agency drives the key turn (choosing how to perceive the wall, aligning doodle and fungi) and the frantic escape. The world-scale “intellectual plague” stake raises conceptual pressure but remains largely off-stage, so most of the felt conflict is physical and procedural. The story could benefit from one sharper moment where his mission meaningfully competes with self-preservation or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s drive to achieve a true symphony despite her silence and prior failures—is clearly established. There is a meaningful deepening when she decodes the Old One’s stress cracks and moves from solitary notes to conducting a complex, living harmony across the grove. However, the escalation is smooth and low-friction: once she has the insight, no obstacle meaningfully tests or endangers her goal. As a result, the final revaluation is moving but feels more like a beautiful realization than a choice under pressure with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelan can wrest meaningful, elegant order from his exile and the nexus—comes through, and pressure does accumulate as the “next phase” approaches. His focused attention and interpretive labor function as agency, culminating in a knowledge/meaning reversal when the lights validate his decoded pattern. However, the narrative offers little sense of what’s at risk if he fails beyond continued melancholy; there’s minimal felt cost or narrowing of options. The escalation is therefore more contemplative than tense, effective but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can capture the grandmother’s specific silence before the fireworks break it—is clear and escalates through the ticking clock, the wrong frequencies, and the looming first launch. His internal adjustment (abandoning the machine’s metrics to trust embodied memory) marks a meaningful tightening and agency-driven turn. However, the opposition is gentle rather than truly testing; nothing substantial threatens his ethic or forces a painful trade-off beyond time pressure. As a result, tension is quietly compelling but never quite sharp enough for higher-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can maintain serenity and attunement under an overwhelming sensory onslaught—is clear and does escalate. The major tightening occurs when the new wind hits, inflicting pain and threatening to shatter her equilibrium, forcing a choice between retreat and a new mode of attention. Her decision to narrow focus to the seed’s scent feels like a meaningful internal act that forecloses the coping tactic of avoidance. That said, the conflict remains relatively gentle and interior; there’s little tangible loss or real risk of failure beyond the philosophical, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—saving the blight-stricken orchards—is clear and tied to Elara’s choices, and the inversion window plus labyrinthine arches provide situational pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when gravity begins to “reclaim itself,” forcing her to act quickly in the cavern. However, opposition is mostly environmental and never seriously threatens failure; she encounters no significant setback, moral trade-off, or genuine risk of losing the shard or her life. As a result, escalation feels controlled and linear rather than sharply testing or transforming her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the cause of the town’s cessation to build predictive foresight—is clear and escalates intellectually. The main tightening is the discovery of the patch, which reorients the entire investigation from ground to sky and drives toward the epicenter. Yet resistance is largely abstract; Kaelen faces little active opposition or concrete risk beyond time and complexity, so conflict feels mostly cerebral rather than viscerally pressurized. The cost surfaces at the end, but it’s more thematic than the result of hard, contested choices.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be reintroduced into a world of sculpted hush—is clear, but it never meaningfully tightens; once Kael senses the cue, execution is smooth and unopposed. There is no reversal, hard choice, or visible sacrifice; he doesn’t confront failure, limitation, or moral friction, only the logistics of a beautiful ritual. The “manufactured quiet” dissolves without any resistance on the page, so tension remains mostly conceptual rather than felt. As a result, the climax is gorgeous but low-pressure, more tableau than tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can he truly understand the nature of his failure—is clear and pursued throughout. Conflict is primarily internal and processual (will he approach the veil as tide rather than wall), and the turn from forceful ward to questioning melody is a meaningful deepening. However, there’s little sense of jeopardy or possibility of renewed failure in the ritual itself; it works on the first attempt, and opposition feels abstract. The result is tense and resonant but not sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Anya’s desire to have her feeling “unmade” versus Elias’s true, colder aim—is clear but not heavily tested. Once she agrees to the process, there are no real alternative options or reversals; the outcome feels foregone. The main tightening is experiential: her grief becomes alien and geometric during the press, but this deepening isn’t driven by fresh choices. The scene is tense atmospherically rather than through escalating conflict with visible prices paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Kael’s relationship to his role and to Elara’s disappearance: will he remain a fearful functionary or inherit her mythic stance. Pressure escalates texturally through the pendant’s activation, the apparition of past travelers, and the crystallizing plants, culminating in an internal reorientation. However, his external situation is never seriously endangered, and there’s little sense of what he risks if he clings to routine, so the cost of the choice is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The ending lands, but without a sharp narrowing of options or painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the world (and the prism) can return a tender, human memory versus a brutal, literal one—is signaled early and tightens as he sets up the experiment under perfect, unrepeatable conditions. Escalation is accumulative but clear: years of failure → rare conditions → breath-held ritual → pattern resolves into the worst possible kind of proof. The decisive “turn” is the recognition of the sheared bolt schematic, which irreversibly alters what his life’s work means. The conflict is almost entirely internal/philosophical, but the on-page pressure is still credible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will finish the tapestry knowing each thread erases the beloved she’s trying to reach—is clear and emotionally legible. Escalation is subtle but effective: last night’s faltering sets a live alternative, and this morning’s decision to recommence tightens pressure toward the irreversible act of weaving the locking threads. The cost is unmistakable in the hollowing of her heart and the loss of his name and details. The conflict remains internal and largely one-directional, so there’s limited back-and-forth or complication beyond the central trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring a dying world at the cost of intimate personal memories—is clear and emotionally legible. Escalation comes from committing to the ritual and then paying a sharper price than anticipated, culminating in his hollowed-out return to the surface. Conflict is mostly internal endurance rather than contested or reversible, so pressure builds steadily but without many turns. The cost is nonetheless unmistakable on the page, especially in the description of lost sensory richness.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes (truth about Elara and preventing another destructive resonance) are legible early and tighten effectively as the hum builds and the catastrophic parallel scene appears. The decisive act—redirecting, not blocking, the energy into uninhabited realities—is a solid escalation choice that fuses emotional and conceptual stakes. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of risk or potential failure in the act itself; the redirection happens almost frictionlessly, without a moment where it seems he might be too late or overwhelmed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—protecting the light/implicit keeper—is introduced clearly when the beam vanishes, and the pressure of the storm and failing lamp coherently escalates toward the repair. His decision to go out into the squall is a meaningful tightening of risk, and the discovery of the logbook adds an emotional deepening. However, the repair itself feels relatively unopposed; there’s little on-page friction or cost in the mechanics beyond “he diagnoses and fixes it,” so escalation flattens slightly at the climax. The farewell stones and sea-glass-beam image reweight the emotional stakes more than the external danger.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—harnessing an enormous, otherworldly storm to reshape the world’s dawn—is grand but remains mostly abstract. Pressure technically escalates as the storm becomes a “monster” and the apparatus strains, yet Kaelan never appears in real danger and faces no meaningful alternative or trade-off. His agency is about execution, not decision under duress, so tension plateaus into spectacle. The unintended prophetic consequences are intriguing but land as an aside rather than an active source of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen’s need to understand why stories “magnetize” to the woman—is clear and carried through to the end. There is one main tightening: his shift from passive watching to active experimentation and then to directly approaching her with the wing. However, the pressure remains low; little risk, fear, or potential loss attends his choice to speak with her, so the escalation is more intellectual than visceral. The resulting realization is satisfying but doesn’t feel hard-won under significant conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Aris’s desire to understand and properly house this shard of sorrow—is clear but remains low-temperature throughout. There is a single meaningful deepening when the sorrow-meter spikes to unprecedented levels, hinting at something dangerous or overwhelming, but nothing on the page actually endangers Aris or forces a hard choice. The climactic moonlight healing arrives as an external grace rather than a consequence of his risk or sacrifice. As a result, tension is consistently gentle and meditative, not truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the tree to save the realm—is clearly signaled early, and the need to reconstruct a forgotten song provides a conceptual obstacle. But conflict is largely internal and processual, with no strong opposing force or meaningful risk of failure once she remembers what must be done; each act of care yields progress without reversal. As a result, tension is gentle and accumulative rather than sharply escalating, and the cost of success is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to live with intense empathy without total withdrawal—is clear from the outset and sharpened by the impending conclave and the click of the door. Pressure escalates plausibly when someone actually enters, forcing him to test his technique instead of retreating physically; his decision to leave the invitation behind is an understated but real turn. Internal and external pressures (Elara’s unseen sorrow vs his fear of being overwhelmed) interweave effectively. The main limiter is that the cost and narrowing of options feel gentle rather than sharply consequential, keeping tension at a quiet simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Elara’s quiet defiance against erasure encountering institutional authority—tightens effectively when the patrolman appears and questions her presence. Her decision to reveal her purpose and offer the bread is a clear turn that could carry real risk in this world. However, the external stakes are kept very soft; he backs down quickly with no real on-page threat of punishment, so cost remains largely conceptual and emotional. The piece would reach a higher band if the risk or trade-off in that moment were more concretely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—capturing the vow’s essence before it fades—is well signaled and escalates as the light gutters and frequencies scatter. Tension tightens effectively around the failing slide and the desperate tuning to isolate the carrier wave, culminating in the single captured tone. The price (the vow’s total disappearance from the living world, salvaged only as data) is clear and felt, though the conflict remains largely procedural and one-sided rather than morally or relationally fraught. Kaelen’s agency matters in the timing and precision of capture, but the outcome still feels somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant conflict—preventing the sale of inherited loyalty/secrets versus the protection-racket norms of the market—is clear and escalates credibly via her successive failed strategies. Each false start removes an avenue (chaos, invoking law, bribery), forcing her toward a more dangerous, morally fraught tactic: publicly undermining Silas. The external and conceptual stakes (family debt, ecosystem survival, violation of hush) are well articulated, with a decisive turn when Eva redirects her ire from Elara to Silas. The on-page personal cost to Elara in the climax could be sharpened a touch; she seems remarkably unthreatened after provoking a dangerous captain.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to understand the “Tempest-touched”—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening as multiple carriers converge and their personal weather intensifies. However, conflict remains largely external and observational: Elara is never forced into a hard choice or trade-off; she mainly watches and interprets. The auroral event resolves the immediate tension almost entirely on its own, with no agency from her beyond showing up. The cost is conceptual rather than pressured—her framework is humbled, but no tangible path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reclaim and reorient his artistic life—is clear, and the old failure with the lock gives a concrete focal point. Pressure does rise as he moves from hurt pride to a delicate, almost surgical attempt to open the mechanism guided only by memory. However, the attempt feels oddly low-risk: there’s no strong sense that he might fail again, damage it irreparably, or lose something irreplaceable in the present moment. The conflict is primarily internal and resolves without a sharp test of commitment, keeping escalation solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering a substrate for honesty in a dishonest society—is clear but mostly conceptual, with few concrete risks or antagonistic forces on the page. Escalation comes via discovery and deepening understanding (map reconstruction, phrase fixation, vault revelation) rather than tightening pressure. Elian’s choice to plant the seed represents agency, but he is never seriously constrained or forced into trade-offs; things open more than they close. This keeps tension relatively gentle and prevents the conflict from feeling fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can successfully free and broadcast a fading truth—is clear, but resistance is mostly conceptual (entropy, forgetting) rather than dramatized as obstacles or genuine risk of failure. Escalation comes primarily from the build-up of work and the approach of the unique wind, not from reversals or tightened options. The self-destruction of the sculpture provides real cost, yet Elian’s agency is largely unopposed craftsmanship rather than choice under duress. As a result, tension reads as meditative and assured rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transmuting destabilizing inner chaos into a portable form in order to escape—remains focused throughout. Pressure escalates meaningfully: from plan, to opening the box, to chaotic backlash and processor overload, to the all-or-nothing compression and dome breach. The protagonist’s agency drives each turn, and the internal conflict (fear vs courage via Elara’s “counter-frequency”) is directly tested by escalating external strain. The cost of the escape (sacrificing the dome’s safety and their assigned role) is present but could be sharpened with one more concrete repercussion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will treat Mrs. Gable’s last correspondence with force or care—is clear and escalated by the threat of drilling. Elias’s choice to listen instead of push provides agency and a meaningful alternative path. However, once the neighbors start talking the puzzle solves somewhat smoothly, with little real risk that the drill option will win or that Elias’s approach will fail. The cost of his stance (time, social patience) is conceptually present but not sharply dramatized, keeping the pressure moderate rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating her mother’s trapped consciousness—is clear and consistently present, and the impasse with the final journal sequence provides the main pressure point. Escalation comes through the cipher’s resistance and Elara’s shift from pure logic to embodied, chance-inflected tactics. However, the opposition never feels truly dangerous or time-bound; once the “chance” insight arrives, resolution unfolds relatively smoothly. The emotional and ethical cost is there but could be sharpened by more visible risk or harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming erased memories of Elara—is clear from early on, and the pressure coherently tightens as tonight’s pull grows stronger, leading to the risky reach into the gravity pocket. The key turn is the brief success followed by immediate loss of the pocket, which tests his commitment and yields a mixed outcome (proof but not restoration). The emotional cost is felt but relatively low on-page danger—no explicit threat to his body, sanity, or current life—so escalation stays mostly internal. Still, the fragmentary win with ongoing loss creates credible tension and consequence for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—neutralizing a contagion-like prophecy—is clearly stated and large in scope, and the act of casting the smoothed hush is framed as the pivotal effort. But all antagonistic pressure remains entirely off-page, and her spell faces no resistance, doubt, or trade-off beyond implied fatigue. The conflict never escalates into a true test; tension is more conceptual than felt. This keeps the piece from achieving substantive dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will confront the truth about Elias and accept or refuse the role he implies for her—is clear and crystallizes effectively on the rooftop. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, with the main tightening being her deliberate move out of the “sanctuary of denial” into a setting where lies are harder to maintain. However, resistance and price are understated: Elias yields the truth with little friction, and Clara’s acceptance comes smoothly, so the felt cost of this transition could be stronger. Conflict is well-shaped but remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—remain safely numb or risk psychic damage to gain authentic independence—is clear and escalates as the memory sharpens from joy to searing trauma. The central tightening comes at the moment he could sever the connection but instead pushes harder, foreclosing the path of curated peace. Internal and external conflict interweave effectively through the physical act of pressing the shell to the spire while enduring the resurgence of trauma. The main weakness is that the aftermath cost is relatively soft, giving his victory a slightly frictionless feel.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can alter the Covenant without sacrilege—is clear and coheres with the “calibrated treason” frame. There is a strong sense of pressure in the lead-up, rooted in the weight of history and potential ruin if he’s discovered or fails. However, escalation is more accumulative than turning: once his method is revealed, nothing on the page pushes back or complicates his execution, and the act succeeds on the first attempt without visible risk of failure. The lack of an on-page obstacle or reversal keeps the tension from cresting as sharply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some people echo and what that means for her mother and herself—is clear and deepens as she moves inward. Escalation is present but gentle: each song and echo nudges knowledge forward until the crystal demands a culminating act of harmony. The cost is primarily emotional and vocational (accepting a melancholic, ongoing burden), which is appropriate but low in immediate tension, leaving little sense of genuine risk or potential failure. Conflict thus reads more contemplative than pressured, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—witnessing the truth to free the boy’s soul—is clear early and tightened by the introduction of the obstructing man. Pressure escalates as Elara moves from passive listening to active construction of a shared dream and then to weaponizing accumulated cameos against the man’s narrative. Her agency in choosing images over accusations sharpens the moral dimension of the conflict. Still, the confrontation itself is fairly one-sided; we never feel that her attempt might fail or harm her, which keeps the perceived cost modest.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can meaningfully “join” or touch the hidden pattern rather than only observe it—is clear and gently escalated through his leaving safety, walking into the field, and daring to whistle. The whistle is a credible peak choice, and the brief seeming response from the fireflies gives a micro-reversal before they move on. However, pressure remains low; there’s no serious alternative path foreclosed beyond a conceptual one, and the cost of failure is primarily existential wistfulness. For a top-tier venue, the conflict feels more contemplative than gripping, holding this below the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true nature of the orchard—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the Ash Diamond’s flaw is recognized as engineered and the stillpoint concept emerges. However, conflict is largely abstract and procedural; there’s no real opposition (human, environmental, or moral) to Kaelen’s investigation. The risk that removing or misusing the stillpoint could imperil the orchard or invite weaponization is mentioned conceptually but never truly pressed on the page. As a result, tension remains steady rather than escalating sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will submit to one of the contending shadow powers or assert a human-centered third way—is clear and escalates well with the Great Storm and the overlapping, incompatible prophecies. The pressure coheres, moving from abstract listening to an ultimatum that demands a stance, and the discovery of the map is a genuine reversal that changes his option set. However, the climax resolves quickly once the map appears, with limited dramatized struggle over the immense cost and risk of defying both powers, so the price of his choice feels somewhat underplayed. The conflict is strong but not quite as punishing or morally knotted as it could be at this ambition level.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the music box’s silence and justifying his own existence through attention—is clear and compelling in a quiet register. There is a meaningful deepening when he recognizes the box’s “dense, weighted silence” and decides not to restore the past but to give it a new, place-born song. However, pressure never truly tightens; nothing opposes him beyond time and solitude, and success feels assured once the premise is laid out. The result is a beautifully executed but low-intensity conflict profile suited to lyric work, rather than a sharply escalating crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—prevent the invasive frequency from damaging the Siren’s Heart—is signaled early and escalates cleanly as the hum intensifies and the tower shudders. The crucial turn is Elara’s choice to adapt by mirroring the frequency instead of “fighting” it directly, which forces her into an excruciating, high-cost tactic. Internal and external pressures align effectively, but we never see a concrete alternative path foreclosed or a sharply articulated external consequence for failure, which slightly softens the sense of risk. Still, the escalation to the “violent shriek” before subsumption offers a solid peak.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—timing and triggering a generationally planned, low-flash revolution—is clear early and narrows toward “Tonight was the night,” with the ripple as a solid tightening turn. Internal and external conflicts interlock: her discipline must hold to exploit a tiny window of vulnerability. The resolution flows from her small but decisive act (the coded pulse) in response to the cosmological beat, rather than coincidence solving things. What holds it below the highest band is that the immediate price or risk of failure is more gestured to than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s choice between signing off a convenient “misadventure” and honoring the complex, psychologically driven preventability of Finch’s death. Pressure escalates as the uncanny sensations intensify and are corroborated by the notebook, turning a simple accident scene into a moral and epistemic dilemma. His final decision to write a fuller, more resistant report is an earned stance crystallization under modest but real institutional pressure. The conflict never quite reaches a sharp on-page confrontation with Fletcher or a clearly costly consequence, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Arthur’s need to understand and meaningfully respond to Thorne’s despair—is established early and stays in focus. Pressure deepens rather than spikes: the key tightening is Elias’s reframing of the heart as a cage and of forgiveness as unearned light, which forces Arthur to relinquish the fantasy of being a “master repairman.” Conflict is primarily internal and relational, so the tension is quiet but real. The cost and foreclosed path are clear, though the escalation curve is gentle enough to keep this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the Algorithm’s command at the risk of death—is signaled early and tested directly by the launch sequence. Escalation is clear: years of abstract study condense into one feverish build and a single, irreversible test drop over a killing sea. Kaelen’s agency is strong; he chooses to act on an unproven insight and to trust an “impossible” wing, with genuine peril if he’s wrong. The piece could push higher by sharpening the internal conflict around that choice (fear vs. calling) or making the personal cost of success/failure more viscerally felt in the moment of freefall.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—recovering Julian’s buried truth versus risking corporate retaliation—are clear and escalate logically as Elara moves from routine maintenance into forbidden sectors, then lies under direct scrutiny. The Kael encounter is a strong tightening beat that forces a concrete, risky choice. The stakes at the ending (exposing a powerful company) are conceptually huge, but the personal cost is mainly implied rather than dramatized in that final moment. Internal and external stakes do braid nicely, with her need for truth finally overriding self-protection.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will fracture over the anchor-line blame—is clear from the opening sentence, and the pressure of past loss effectively undergirds Mara’s vehemence. The main tightening comes from Kael stepping away to seek truth, then returning with a reframed narrative that forces everyone to confront fear rather than malice. Still, Kael faces relatively little resistance or dilemma; his empathic method works seamlessly and the resolution is smooth, with limited sense that he risks status, error, or backlash. The stakes feel real but the escalation curve is gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—her need to comprehend endings before her own euthanasia—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt reversals: the accumulative catalog of debris, the “fold in patience,” and the growing groan of the ice narrow toward the culminating sound. However, Elara isn’t forced into a difficult trade-off or a visibly costly decision in the moment; her ticket is already booked, and nothing challenges that plan. The result is a strong, coherent internal conflict whose escalation feels modest rather than truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will relate to this old heartbreak—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates internally as his observations of the mismatched vines force him to reconsider the “chemistry” of the relationship and reinterpret the burning of the letter. The turn from seeing the fire as spite to seeing it as preservation is a meaningful deepening that reweights his loss and ends in a new stance. However, the conflict remains entirely interior and contemplative, with relatively low on-page cost or concrete foreclosed options beyond his internal posture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the prophet’s wisdom from distortion—is legible early, and the pavilion scene efficiently sets up the pressure. However, conflict is largely unopposed once Kael decides to leave; the journey and ritual proceed without genuine threat of failure or competing obligation. The one real tightening is the “most critical moment” of consecration, but even there the success feels foregone rather than hard-won. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping, which limits escalation under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming communal pain into a healing artwork—is clear, but the on-page pressure is very low and mostly retrospective. There is no real opposition to Elias’s work, internal or external; the “escalation” is more a graceful accumulation of correspondences than a tightening of options. The only genuine turn is the placement of the final photograph, which completes the spiral and allows him to leave. As a result, the story feels serene and contemplative rather than tense, limiting conflict depth.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what Elias does with his discovery about language’s true nature—emerges clearly, but pressure is mostly internal and low on overt resistance. Escalation comes through the deepening density and patterning of the sounds he hears over weeks, culminating in the realization that process, not product, is the locus of growth. His final choice to refrain from writing and instead “testify” through silent listening is a genuine renunciation that forecloses a path. Still, the conflict never feels truly fraught; the story leans toward meditative inevitability rather than sharpened dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—can he locate the nexus and perform the capturing act before his foretold forgetting robs him of the method—is clearly signaled and coherently escalated. Pressure tightens as markers become more desperate, the hum grows more intense, and his memory gap at the slab obliterates his planned solution at the peak moment. His agency in choosing the imperfect circle over paralysis crystallizes his internal conflict, with the cost being the loss of the specific, carefully engineered capture he’d dedicated his life to. The conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, which fits the mode but keeps the escalation from feeling truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes (station’s destruction vs. creating a timeless prison and sacrificing his last link to his lover) are clear and scale appropriately to the length. Escalation is tangible through worsening vibrations, the spinning hand’s “theoretical limit,” and the shattering crack in the portal. However, the resolution feels slightly unopposed—Elias never meaningfully falters or faces a real chance of failure, so the external and internal conflicts converge without a hard test of his resolve. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than viscerally felt in the moment, which is effective but keeps pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving a “flawless goodbye” by reuniting father and daughter—is clear and structurally consistent. There is one real tightening: the need to overcome Lena’s resistance before Mr. Aris dies, which Elara tackles by making the decisive call and curating the environment. Yet most conflict is gentle and partially off-page; Lena’s resistance is resolved by summary, and once she arrives there is little remaining tension or risk in the scene. The result is moving but somewhat low-pressure for elite-level escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing a pocket of sense by solving the noon-shadow mystery—is clear but largely intellectual, with little felt risk if she fails beyond continued uncertainty. Escalation exists in her weeks of study culminating in the precise manipulation and insertion of the key, yet the pressure around that activation is meditative rather than tense. There is no real opposition or credible chance of harm, so the “tightening” is more conceptual than dramatic. The resolution feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Elias’s rational certainty versus his hunger to believe Elara—intensifies convincingly once the tooth is found. The escalation is more internal than external, but the tooth’s appearance meaningfully narrows his options: he cannot sustain his old stance without self-betrayal. The “compound fracture of the soul” and the final act of drawing a new constellation make the cost of this shift felt. The piece stops short of a sharper external test (e.g., confronting the town), which keeps the pressure strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical—fire vs starlight, destruction vs patient radiance—with the main pressure being her need to reclaim light without repeating past harms. There is a meaningful mid-scene tightening when she pauses to weigh the shard’s potential against the memory of the fire, choosing to continue; and an external deepening when the stray sliver of twilight catalyzes the glass’s change. However, stakes remain relatively abstract, and the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping tension in a contemplative register rather than a sharply escalated one.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen remains trapped in a viral failure-identity or accepts the possibility of renewal—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates quietly as Elara tracks the drip pattern over days and then chooses to break the sanctuary’s silence, with the tightening focused on her risk in confronting his fossilized self-image. The offer of the pendant is a genuine turn that narrows options: either he remains the “fossil” or entertains her reframing, and his changed breath/fingers closing signal an internal costed choice. Some readers may want a touch more resistance or collision from Kaelen to sharpen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully atone for and live with his sacrificed stories—is signaled early and tightened as the current intensifies from pressure to gale. The key turn is his realization that he cannot resurrect them but can honor them, which leads directly to the burial act. Stakes remain internal but are felt as real loss and risk of annihilation (“sweep him into nothingness”). The escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it coherently narrows his options under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering sacred practices to heal a listless village—is stated and present, but it never faces a true on-page test beyond minor nervousness (“his fingers… trembled slightly”). There’s no genuine threat of failure or opposition during the ritual, so escalation reads as a smooth unveiling rather than pressure narrowing options. As a result, the final success feels somewhat inevitable, with limited sense of price or risk paid within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—turning a terrified child’s heartbeat into a safe path—is conceptually strong and clear, and the offstage danger is understandable. However, on-page conflict is minimal: once he has the heartbeat, every subsequent step succeeds without obstruction, doubt, or cost-based choice. Escalation is mostly a deepening of ritual, not an increase in pressure or narrowing of options. The final endurance beat is thematically apt but doesn’t feel like it required a hard trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving echoes/wonder against a dead world—is clear, but opposition is mostly environmental and never actively pushes back. Elian’s process unfolds without a meaningful reversal or serious threat of failure; the “days bled into weeks” montage compresses struggle rather than dramatizing a key test or trade-off. As a result, the pressure accumulates atmospherically rather than in a concrete tightening that forecloses options, and his success feels earned intellectually but not hard-won emotionally. The conflict is thus evocative but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this specific shard of grief can be oriented into peace and added to the pattern without breaking Kaelen—is clear but carries limited suspense. There is a credible tightening as the wisp is coaxed in, contained, and forced into lattice by the starlight, but the outcome feels foregone; we rarely sense that his method might fail, fracture him, or change his stance. The internal cost (his deepening solitude and accumulated weight) is more compelling than the on-page risk to the process. Effective, yet more potential for genuine jeopardy or trade-off remains untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elara manages her grief without being consumed by it—is clear from the outset. Escalation is quiet but real: she moves from intention to the hard work of choosing one memory, then to embodying it physically with the first irreversible cut. The kettle’s approaching boil provides a temporal tightening that dovetails with her narrowing focus. The cost remains mostly internal and understated; a slightly sharper sense of what this ritual threatens or risks (beyond implied emotional strain) would push tension higher.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can reframe his crushing regret enough to live with his past—is legible early and coherently tightened by the discovery of the camera wheel. The wheel’s memory cascade functions as the key deepening, collapsing his vague guilt into a specific, inarguable fault that forces a new stance. Escalation is primarily internal; there’s no secondary pressure or real risk of alternative outcomes beyond psychological stasis, which keeps the pressure strong but somewhat quiet. The resolution is clearly driven by his choice to state, “It was my fault,” foreclosing self-exoneration.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can resurrect the hidden intent of the terminal and thereby reframe her notion of hope—is clear and escalates as she commits more labor and risk to redirecting power. The flip of the breaker is a solid tightening beat and the brief moment of “nothing happened” gives a small but effective reversal. However, external stakes (physical danger, job consequences, demolition clock) are muted, keeping tension more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can truly relinquish or integrate his abandoned dream—is legible and emotionally credible. Pressure accrues in an internal, situational way rather than via overt reversals; the key deepening is when he chooses to arrange, not destroy or hide, the bells. That said, escalation is modest: the piece begins already framed as a “one last time” act, so options feel somewhat foreclosed from the outset. A slightly sharper moment of doubt or alternative (taking the coffer back, smashing a bell) could heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—learning whether his grandfather’s disgrace was deserved—is clear from early on and meaningfully tightened by the time pressure and the mounting “listening” effort with the grappling hook. The decisive deepening occurs with the discovery of the two plan sets and journal, which reweights everything rather than simply answering a mystery. The cost is primarily internal (revising his foundational grievance) and lands, though external risk or immediate consequence is muted, keeping the tension at a quiet but steady level. Escalation is more accumulative than sharply reversed, but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and preserving an ancient method—is clear, and the knot’s three-day resistance gives a hint of prior pressure. The main escalation is conceptual: recognizing the knot as a sequence/phrase rather than a single form, which deepens the stakes from technique to philosophy. However, there’s little sense of what is at risk if he fails today, and no strong reversal or narrowing of options beyond steady progress; tension stays low and cerebral. As a result, the conflict feels more meditative than pressured, limiting stakes intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can truly apprehend and articulate Elara’s “explained absence”—is clear, and pressure deepens as the projection becomes “shockingly intimate,” forcing him to witness and process her grief and transformation. The escalation is primarily internal and textural, but it does move from curiosity to immersion to a reconfigured understanding that drives his closing act of writing. What keeps this from higher bands is the relative softness of resistance: there’s little sense that he risks failure, misinterpretation, or personal cost beyond the emotional weight of what he sees.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can coax any living beauty back into this mechanical world—is clear and persists throughout, with tension rooted in each unsure step (choice of resin, temperature, pulse-mimicking clockwork). Pressure does escalate as his health frays and the incubation period stretches into a “sleepless haze,” culminating in the crack and emergence. However, the conflict is largely situational and internal; there’s no strong opposing force beyond uncertainty and decay, and the climax hinges more on witnessing than on a difficult, on-page choice. As a result, the cost feels real but muted rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Conflict is primarily ethical and emotional: can Elara rewrite her inheritance by choosing to heal rather than destroy, and will anything of the banyan survive. The stakes crystallize when she shifts from generic firefighting to the specific, almost impossible hope of the graft, and the key tightening is her choice to sacrifice the coin’s thread to bind it. External resistance is relatively soft—the fire is largely past when her central choice arrives—so escalation is more in the deepening of her commitment than in hard opposition. Cost and foreclosed paths are still clear: she trades her last neutral relic of her father for a fragile, uncertain act of care.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—liberating the city’s trapped memories and testing her own belief—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening at the climax as the chaotic light must resolve into a sigil before the window of the Locksmith’s Eye closes. Her agency directly drives the outcome via the meticulous, high-focus adjustment of the box. However, there is little sense of what is concretely lost if she fails beyond disappointment; opposition is mostly the possibility of error and time’s narrowness, which keeps tension meditative rather than gripping. As a result, escalation feels elegant but somewhat low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking a generationally entrenched, consumptive renewal pattern—is powerful in concept and signaled early. The main deepening/turn is the encounter with the Heretic Ancestor’s gear, which reframes both the failed rational solution and Xylar’s path. Yet pressure remains abstract: nothing on the page pushes back against Xylar’s new stance, and no option is truly foreclosed beyond letting the gear drift away. The ending reads more like a serene pivot than a hard-won stance against live, escalating forces.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can grasp and embody the “shape of collective grief”—is clearly established and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates texturally: his obsession, the swelling migration, and then the storm focus him on the nexus point in the slate. The decisive deepening at the storm’s peak, when his chisel follows the converging lines, credibly produces a before/after shift in his understanding and practice. Still, the conflict stays largely contemplative, with limited sense of risk or cost beyond internal strain, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can genuinely release rather than merely curate the town’s grief—is clear, and it tightens around the approach of the pendulum’s apex. The passage marking “the hardest part of the ritual, the letting go” gives a credible peak of pressure, with his diligence and need for order actively resisting release. However, much of the conflict remains interior and conceptual, with limited on-page sense that failure would change his or the town’s options beyond maintaining the status quo. The escalation is sufficient for a quiet, lyric piece but not maximally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can successfully decode and finally understand the intention behind the sovereign case and echoes—is clear and carries through to the end. There is a meaningful tightening when the scattered thread manipulations cohere into a map and the case reacts, but the pressure remains intellectual and contemplative rather than fraught. Elias is never meaningfully tempted to stop, misread, or choose between incompatible goods; his agency is steady, not truly tested. The conflict is effective for a quiet piece but too undemanding to climb into the higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to impose a difficult, risky transformation on his people or allow slow extinction—is clear and weighty. Pressure coheres and deepens through his review of model outcomes, especially the contrast between desolate extinction and “slow thaw” adaptation, and culminates in the act of beginning to write. However, escalation within the scene is relatively gentle; he moves from contemplation to decision without a sharp new complication or reversal on the page. The cost is conceptual and long-term rather than viscerally felt in-scene, which slightly softens the tension’s climb.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving outlawed stories at real personal risk—is clear, but pressure stays mostly implied. We never see an interruption, near-discovery, or even a small mishap to tighten options; his fear is present as background rather than tested by an escalating event. The main “turn” is the reveal of the luminous words, which deepens meaning more than it narrows choices. The ending reads as a reaffirmation of ongoing defiance, credible but softly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can achieve a controlled illusion of peace—is clear, and pressure does steadily tighten as the ritual proceeds from observation to irreversible acts (burning, handing him the urn, the timed scattering). The live clock of the slowing chair gives the climax a nice, tangible constraint. Still, conflict remains largely uncontested; nothing meaningfully resists Elara’s process or Kael’s belief on the page, so escalation feels graceful rather than truly testing or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas’s preservation of reason matters in a myth-dominated world—is clear from early on and sharpened by the girl’s fearful reaction to the “shiny.” The main escalation is internal: the cog heightens his existential doubt, and the child’s rejection forecloses the fantasy of conversion, forcing a choice of role. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatic, but his recommitment to solitary archiving carries real weight. There’s only one major tightening beat, yet it’s effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can coax true harmony from historically hostile communities—is signaled clearly and remains coherent. Escalation is mostly internal: from another failed hymn and resignation to a conceptual breakthrough and a risky, wordless exercise with the choir. The breathing circle and single-note hum provide a satisfying tightening, though the resistance and cost in that moment are relatively gentle and quickly smoothed. The piece could benefit from one sharper on-page point of friction or near-failure during the exercise to deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reshaping his people’s encoded history in a single, unrepeatable window—is clear and conceptually weighty. There is a mild escalation as the plant erupts chaotically and each taste reveals more poisonous memories, pushing him “to prune” with increasing decisiveness. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and procedural, without a strong sense that he might fail, misjudge, or pay a concrete price beyond fatigue and gravity of task. Because his choices never face a real counter-pressure or reversal, the stakes feel more declared than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the failure is understood as a glitch or as the death of a cultivated, wonder-dependent lifeform—is clear but operates on a reflective register more than an urgent one. Pressure rises modestly when Lena presses for an “official word” and when she has to engage the riddle to extract truth. The primary agency lies in Silas’s method of revelation and Lena’s interpretive work, which do reconfigure her mission but without much visible cost or narrowing of options on the page. The conflict remains largely conceptual and never quite bites hard enough to feel high-stakes in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully resist creeping sterility—tightens around the “white cube” as her most desperate, focused attempt. There is a clear escalation from small pranks (doormats, gargoyle) to investing her grandmother’s shard, signaling personal cost and commitment, and the later sight of the flamingo and flowers validates her method. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical; the external risk (trespassing, social sanction) is barely felt, so tension remains gentle rather than sharp. The result is a strong but low-amplitude pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will commit an act of mass poisoning in the name of a false righteousness—is clear early via the ampoule and mission brief. Pressure tightens as the supposed structural weakness is revealed to be a lung, directly raising the ethical cost of action and reconfiguring options. Her final refusal and burial of the ampoule is an earned renunciation with palpable moral consequence, even if immediate external danger (e.g., surface retaliation) remains off-page. The escalation is primarily internal but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can use logic to pierce the closed system and access his lost moment—is clear and builds toward the single decisive action of the roll. Pressure escalates as the grand proof nears completion and the risk of “unraveling his own [logic]” looms, and the rupture delivers an intense emotional cost. However, the lead-up feels relatively assured and frictionless; his doubt or fear doesn’t meaningfully endanger his commitment in-scene. The conflict stays primarily intellectual, with little sense that he might choose not to enact the proof at the last second.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether kindness can still be communicated and remembered—is clear from early on and tightens through the preparations and the risky public reveal. The main escalation happens in the silence after he switches on the spotlights, with his doubt rising as minutes stretch into an hour. The eventual answering lights provide a satisfying turn, though the conflict is primarily internal and symbolic rather than sharply pressured by external opposition. The cost is mainly emotional vulnerability rather than a hard trade-off, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—physical survival intertwined with cultural extinction—is signaled early and escalates from background dread to a specific, time-sensitive threat (the ice web that could crush them). Conflict tightens through the council’s resignation, forcing Alistair into opposition against communal passivity and his own hopelessness, and culminates in the risky collective experiment with song. The internal and external stakes are neatly interwoven as the very arts he seeks to preserve become the instrument of salvation. What’s missing for a higher score is a more acute sense of potential backfire or ethical tension around involving children in a potentially deadly attempt, which would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—risking erasure to escape fate’s design—is articulated, and the external timer of the tide offers a nominal pressure point. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and largely decided before the scene begins; by the time we enter, he is already committed, and no new information or reversal meaningfully tests that commitment. The main escalation is simply the machine being completed and turned on, without additional complications or narrowing options. As a result, tension is steady but not sharply intensifying, and the cost is gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—using his cursed state to trick and then destroy Fear—is clear early and escalates coherently as he descends deeper into the funhouse. The mirror carousel scene is an effective tightening, with Fear attempting to fix him in his brokenness, forcing the costly confession. The final reversal, where his void becomes an “anchor,” is satisfying and logically prepared. The defeat of Fear feels slightly quick and frictionless on the page, with minimal sense that he might fail once the insight arrives, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (protecting the fragile floating orchard from the Razor Squall) is clear and concrete, and the storm’s arrival provides real external pressure. Yet the conflict escalates smoothly without meaningful reversal: Kai’s plan works exactly as intended once initiated, with no complication, misstep, or forced trade-off. His internal state during the peak (more performance than fear) also blunts tension. The result is atmospheric rather than gripping; the piece feels like watching a virtuoso execute a well-rehearsed piece rather than face a true test.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to the expedition and what the watchers are “saying”—is clear early and escalates as Kaelen moves from suspicion to partial decoding to the risky act of answering. The climactic choice to play the completed pattern, despite “sun-baked certainty” of looming truth, is a solid agency moment that triggers the revelation and imposes a conceptual cost. Most of the conflict is internal and situational rather than adversarial; neighbors’ doubt and the city’s inertia are gestured at rather than dramatized, and the future conflict of convincing others is left off-stage. Still, pressure coheres and deepens logically, and the closing shift from private quest to impossible civic burden is a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—truth versus a stabilizing lie—is clear from the outset and escalates as Aris reframes Elara’s role from guardian of peace to curator of structural weakness. His Ashworth example raises the stakes from abstract morality to concrete historical catastrophe, which credibly shifts her options. The decisive turn (her opening the case) is earned but slightly under-contested; Elara offers minimal counter-argument or resistance for someone entrusted with a century-old secret. As a result, the tension lands as intellectually compelling but emotionally smoother than the stakes suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stake—preserving the inkwell as vessel of his vocation—is clear early and tightens convincingly when the current knocks it loose. That physical jeopardy nicely concentrates the abstract stakes of memory and loss into a concrete, time-pressured scramble. The price (scraped knuckles, risk of drowning, emotional vulnerability) is present, though the internal ethical or relational calculus remains relatively simple. Still, the escalation feels proportionate and the resolution derives credibly from his commitment rather than luck alone.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the city’s official narrative will stand unchallenged in Elias’s domain—is coherent and escalates from vague dissonance to confirmed theft and a consequential choice of response. Pressure is largely internal and quiet, operated through knowledge rather than external opposition, but there is a clear tightening once the stamp matches the mark. The cost of his choice (risk to position, loneliness of secret resistance) is more implied than dramatized, softening the impact. There’s no strong reversal or serious threat from other agents, which limits the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can survive and shape his grief via confronting Elara’s final dream—is clear early and paid off in the basilica. Pressure deepens as ascent becomes a descent into memory and as he actively chooses to polish the gem rather than succumb, culminating in the risky act of inserting it into the lantern. The climax forces him to endure both the promise and impossibility of the dream, reconfiguring his relationship to pain. The conflict remains primarily internal and could feature one sharper, on-page moment of doubt or near-refusal to heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—locating the reservoir of stolen potential before the system comes back online—is clear early and tightens as diagnostics signal time running out. The main escalation comes from the convergence of time pressure and the collapsing “noise” into a single spike, with the breaker’s reset giving a concrete cadence to the climax. Stakes skew conceptual rather than visceral, but the story does make the loss of “twenty-seven stolen futures” feel weighty enough to support that abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—will she finally connect with and decode the “frequency of belonging”?—is clear, and pressure coherently tightens from initial insertion of the chip to straining the drone to open the hidden mechanism. The key turn (pulling the ring to iris the dome open) is driven by her agency and leads directly to resolution. However, the conflict feels relatively low-friction: there’s little tangible risk of failure, time pressure, or meaningful negative consequence dramatized on the page. As a result, tension reads more as steady puzzle-solving wonder than genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can uncover what truly happened to Anya and what that implies—is clear from early on and deepens with the discovery that she was excised from memory. The main tightening is the revelation that silence is a weaponized erasure, which reweights his guilt and options and leads to a new, costly mission. However, the on-page conflict is almost entirely internal; the search for the driftwood piece proceeds without resistance or real risk, so tension never quite spikes. The political danger and moral cost are powerful but remain mostly conceptual rather than felt as concrete pressure in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—two prisoners’ lives and a fragile political thaw—are clearly signaled, and the ritual’s solemnity lends inherent tension. However, there is little escalation: once both sides appear, the exchange proceeds almost without friction or surprise, and no choice truly narrows options beyond what’s preordained by protocol. Elias’s internal struggle (fear of repeating past tragedy) is thematically present but not pushed into a moment where he must risk, improvise, or deviate. As a result, the piece feels more like a beautifully rendered consummation than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—continue penitent avoidance on land vs. re-engage the sea that betrayed and defines him—is clear early and tightens steadily. The presence of the carefree kayak couple and the humming wires deepens his sense of loss and pressure. Escalation is primarily internal but culminates in a concrete stance: not boarding a boat yet, but no longer walking away, which forecloses the “flight” option. A slightly sharper external hinge (a more pointed immediate decision) could have raised the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain in sterile post-procedure stasis or confront the dangerous legacy of his erased self—is signaled early and tightened by the discovery of the coordinates and the choice to enter the fissure. Pressure coherently escalates from abstract puzzle-solving into a literal and psychological descent culminating in the letter. The resolution, choosing to focus on future empathy rather than reconstructing the past, is a clear stance crystallization. That said, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat abstract; we never feel a truly sharp on-page price or live alternative path foreclosed beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant conflict—his desire to reach Lyra versus his fear and loathing of metamorphosis—is established early and tightens as the ritual amplifies the physical change. The key turn is his decision to “push past the fear, surrendering to the change,” which forecloses the option of remaining human and pays a visible cost. Tension is largely internal and textural rather than driven by external obstruction, but it reads coherent and escalating under that lens. A more dramatized moment of potential refusal or failure in the middle would add sharper contour to the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary conflict—Elara’s compulsion to “find where lost time accumulates” versus the impossibility of that desire—is clearly established and tightened across the piece. The beat where the family custom “fails” and becomes a judgment is a strong escalation that justifies the extremity of her pilgrimage. The decisive act of unfastening the cloak and choosing a new ritual provides a credible cost: she relinquishes a fantasy of control and accepts ongoing imperfection. The stakes remain internal and could withstand one more sharply dramatized moment of resistance at the climax, but they are still effective.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension by integrating humanity’s despair—is clear early and intensifies as Elara confronts progressively deeper griefs. The escalation is primarily internal but well-marked, peaking with the photograph of her own childhood and the last infant. The cost is legible in her near-crushing desolation and the implied surrender of her long-held solitary existence once her purpose is fulfilled. Pressure could be sharpened slightly with a clearer sense of what genuine failure or breaking under the weight would mean beyond the poetic “shuddering” of the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how transformation manifests in this charged landscape—remains mostly conceptual and low-pressure. The detour provides a clear tightening, and the release of the fireflies produces a tangible world-shift, but Kael never faces a real dilemma or risk; coincidence and prophecy do much of the heavy lifting. The volcano’s “restive soul” is evoked, yet there’s no palpable danger of eruption or failure on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a beautiful crescendo of imagery than a hardening conflict with visible costs or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—quietly seizing control of the fort for a revolution—is strong in concept, but on-page opposition is almost nonexistent: the captains’ panic creates cover rather than pressure. The main tightening is the moment of doubt before the chime, yet Kael never truly faces a narrowed option set or visible loss. The operation succeeds on the first try without complication, giving the piece more the feel of a successful heist vignette than a tested conflict. As a result, tension is present but modest for the scale of the ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—save the bluff/patterns and keep Elara’s promise—is legible early, and the coming tide plus aurora create coherent pressure. There is a meaningful tightening when the aurora “pulsed” and the wave crests as he’s mid-ritual. However, Kael’s choice to use the star dust is not heavily contested or complicated in-scene, so the climactic act resolves the danger with little reversal or trade-off beyond implied future risk. The tension works but could be heightened with more palpable jeopardy or a clearer price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain in safe, self-absorbed contemplation or actively confront the scars—comes through clearly. Pressure escalates via the darkroom timer: its ticking structures his interior struggle, and the “ping” is an effective, concrete turn where the mask “is gone.” The conflict is primarily internal, with no antagonist beyond his own reluctance, but the envelope, key, and negative give that conflict tangible hooks. Because we only see the commitment to leave rather than a choice between competing external harms, the stakes feel profound but still somewhat contained.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant conflict is Kaelen versus Elara’s encoded challenge, refracted as Kaelen versus the sundial’s shadow; that stake is legible and specific. Pressure does increase as he progresses through the sequence and the sun moves toward the final painted line, but the escalation remains mostly procedural rather than genuinely risky—failure carries no visible consequence beyond lost face or time. His fencing choices drive the turns, yet there’s no on-page reversal or moment of genuine danger or dilemma. As a result, tension is intellectually engaging but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether their fragile, word-based resistance can move beyond private penance into shared, risky community—is present and clarified when the drifters appear. Pressure escalates modestly as Silas must choose between guarded solitude and inviting strangers into the sanctuary, and his offering of the poem as “first brick” is an earned crystallization of that choice. Still, the conflict remains very low-key: there’s little sense of concrete danger from the world outside or from rejection, so the emotional and practical cost of saying “there is shelter here” never quite bites. The piece succeeds as a quiet, hopeful turning point, but the stakes could be sharpened without sacrificing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching her before the realm collapses—is legible and tied to the “until the horizon invites night” time limit and failing compasses. Escalation comes from abstract grief → sharpened resolve → executing the risky musical-film hack → opening a portal and stepping through, which is a clear narrowing of options. Internal and external conflicts align, but we rarely feel him doubt or waver, so the tension reads more as determined execution than tested commitment. The felt price of leaving his last refuge and possibly dying in the attempt is there but underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes—lose the island’s cultural memory vs. hazard a non-empirical ritual—are clearly established and kept in view. Pressure escalates from abstract fraying stories to the immediate tang of the monsoon and Elara’s panic, culminating in her interpretive breakthrough and choice to sing and plant. Her agency drives the central turn, and internal and external stakes are braided effectively. The main limitation is that, once she acts, success arrives with minimal friction or visible sacrifice beyond the conceptual risk, which keeps the escalation just shy of fully bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kenji can reconfigure his grief/guilt into something bearable—is clear from early on and tightens toward the moment when the tide turns against the wind and he decides to act. The ritual at the bluff is a genuine escalation and his choice to use the compass in line with Elara’s instructions constitutes real agency. However, the piece largely skips over resistance: there’s little sense he might refuse, fail, or misread the pattern, so the pressure never quite bites as hard as it could. The cost (relinquishing self-punishment) is present but rendered as gentle ease rather than a sharply felt trade-off.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Internal conflict between the desire for sterile cosmic order and the reality of terrestrial mess is well-dramatized. The escalation through the specific mechanism of the "dust lens" provides coherent pressure that forces the protagonist to re-evaluate his relationship to the chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Internal stakes are clear and escalate well towards the decision to use the kiln. However, the external antagonist (smugglers) remains entirely retrospective and distant, reducing the immediate pressure of the "retracing" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the internal stakes are clear, the conflict resolution is weak; the "surge of will" acts as a textual shortcut that dissolves the antagonistic force (trauma) without a visible tactical trade-off. The "violent orange" is "softened" too easily, lowering the felt cost of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.6)
    Escalation is linear and lacks genuine opposition; the "static" is a constant background pressure rather than an evolving threat that forces difficult choices. The protagonist faces no reversal or dilemma once the journey begins, and the ending brings total relief without a visible, paid price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.3)
    Conflict is muted; the potential "trap" of the donations is dismissed in a single sentence, and the community offers no resistance to Elara's plan. The antagonist (sanctions) is a static background condition, and the resolution is gifted by an external benefactor rather than earned through costly trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pressure is purely internal and resolves linearly through the breathing ritual; while the &quot;phantom limb&quot; ache provides initial stakes, the victory is uncontested and lacks a moment where failure seems possible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly as memory actively disintegrates, forcing a crisis point. The resolution requires a meaningful sacrifice (intentional amnesia) rather than a convenient reset, ensuring the cost is paid in full.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high and clearly established early on. The escalation moves cleanly from the falling wall to the arrival of the key (arrow) and the activation of defenses. The ending achieves "Earned Stasis," where Elara accepts her lack of freedom to secure the future, providing a legible cost to her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear (emotional torment vs. resolution), and the ritual provides a structured escalation. However, the conflict is largely internal and procedural; the opposition comes from the pain of the memories, which is described ("agonizing") but passes relatively quickly. The cost of the imprint feels somewhat low given the buildup, resolving into "perfect silence" without a lasting scar or trade-off visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there are no antagonists, no physical obstacles, and no significant internal doubts to overcome. The stakes are purely metaphysical, and Silas achieves his goal without paying a visible or felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are immediate and physical, forcing a clear trade-off between the artistic "safe zone" and survival. The escalation is coherent under a Causal/Situational lens, and the cost of abandoning the sphere is visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes of survival and identity are established, the conflict lacks genuine pressure; the protagonist solves the central problem instantly via a found object and a convenient phone. The antagonist poses no active threat in the scene, reducing the climax to a mechanical execution of a code rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is provided by the window of the "single star," but the conflict remains low-stakes and procedural without active opposition. The cost is implied in the backstory ("worn smooth") rather than visceral in the scene's decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear—eternal ignorance versus dangerous understanding. The escalation moves cleanly from physical attempts (sweeping, shattering) to the internal, existential risk of data interfacing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes of connection versus isolation are clear and escalate through the cryptic messages. The turning point—his realization that the doodles are grief, not accusation—recontextualizes the conflict meaningfully. The tension is quiet but sustained, fitting the "hush" tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear (tenure), but the protagonist's agency is low during the climax; he waits for judgment while nature intervenes to save him. The final action (cracking the marble) reclaims agency, but the external conflict is resolved by a "lucky" coincidence rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    Tension is primarily atmospheric and intellectual rather than interpersonal or deeply personal for the protagonist. While the "hush" creates a ticking clock, the lack of active opposition or a high-stakes trade-off for Elias limits the dramatic pressure; the success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain relatively low and strictly personal; the risk of ruining the program is the only potential cost, and the payoff is immediate and total. The conflict lacks external pressure or a "ticking clock," relying entirely on the protagonist's internal drive, which lowers tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tension between "found" and "failed" creates a coherent binary pressure that is resolved by a decisive internal renunciation. The cost—forfeiting the answer to preserve the memory—is legible and felt, effectively collapsing the external stakes into an internal burden.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from auditory hallucinations to a focused supernatural threat, culminating in a decisive physical action with felt cost ("groan of tortured metal," "exhaustion"). The protagonist’s agency is central to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are internal but high—the dissolution of the self—and escalate clearly with the specific memory of Aeridor. The resolution provides relief while maintaining the tension of the inevitable return, giving weight to the stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist encounters no genuine resistance from the client or the environment, resulting in low dramatic tension. While the eclipse forces a situational climax, the lack of a "fail state" or visible trade-off flattens the stakes of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The escalation of knowledge through the diary entries deepens the stakes from historical curiosity to existential grief. However, the conflict is almost entirely retrospective; the protagonist faces no immediate active opposition or difficult trade-off beyond the burden of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    The primary weakness is a lack of active opposition or obstacle; the plan executes perfectly without complication. The stakes are intellectualized ("art of the solution") rather than visceral, keeping narrative pressure low until the final resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear, and the escalation through layered sound is inventive. However, the conflict resolves rapidly; the entity crumbles after a single rhetorical trap, reducing the felt sense of risk or cost. A deeper back-and-forth or a more visceral price paid by Alistair would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is present via the approaching dawn, but the stakes ("opening chord of reality") are high-concept and lack visceral, defined consequences for failure. The cost is limited to "last reserve of strength," a standard fatigue trope that doesn't force a difficult tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of eternal imprisonment are clear, and the "creeping shadows" provide a functional ticking clock. However, the conflict is resolved by an internal switch ("did not fight") that evaporates the external threat instantly, reducing the felt cost of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no on-page conflict or resistance; the audience is willing, the equipment functions perfectly, and the result is immediate relief. The "war" mentioned in the exposition is not dramatized in the scene, resulting in a flat narrative arc without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear: the safety of his solitude versus the pull of the anomaly. The escalation from the abstract "feeling of being watched" to the concrete evidence of the pigeon tightens the pressure effectively. The choice to engage with the "storm-that-wasn't" forecloses the option of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal but legible; the tension comes from his resistance to the very thing he seeks. The escalation is subtle, moving from caution to the inevitable surrender to the scent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are high in concept (existence) but low in dramatic tension; the antagonist is passive, waiting for Elias to solve the puzzle. The escalation is purely intellectual, lacking a visceral sense of risk or rising pressure before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the "heavier" quiet provides atmospheric pressure but fails to generate palpable risk or stakes. The escalation is textural (from silence to resonance) rather than dramatic, and the lack of a clear obstacle or potential for failure limits the emotional impact of the success.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from professional precision to personal emotional endurance. The cost of the transaction—retaining the "dark twin" of the memory—is felt and distinct. However, the climax (the separation of the emotions) is handled with some narrative summary ("With immense concentration") rather than a beat-by-beat struggle, which softens the final pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    The scene lacks meaningful opposition or escalation; the interaction proceeds as a linear, frictionless exchange of pleasantries leading to a benevolent gesture. There is no risk of failure, and the "emotional risk" mentioned is abstract and not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal stakes (belonging vs. isolation) are clear and resolve meaningfully through the final sacrifice of his art. The external pressure is lighter; the search succeeds without significant setbacks, making the external victory feel somewhat effortless compared to the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high (the giant waking), but the conflict lacks active opposition at the climax; the Chronovore simply watches and dissolves without a fight. The protagonist faces no significant obstacle or trade-off in the final act, making the victory feel unearned and the cost negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract without meaningful escalation or a credible threat of failure; the ritual proceeds without distinct pressure points or hard choices. The conflict is static, resolved by the smooth execution of a plan rather than a confrontation with the unexpected.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist navigates with "innate knowledge" and encounters no obstacles or opposition. The stakes are resolved by a secret benefactor who succeeds on the first try without having to improvise or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly established (selling the nursery vs. rebuilding) and escalate through the failed physical attempt to repair the trellis. The turning point changes the protagonist's approach effectively, though the opposition is largely internal/environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (artistic meaning vs. survival) is clearly signaled and resolved through a legible trade-off. The cost is visible on the page—sacrificing the physical value of the "relic of a gentler age" for the intangible value of the story—satisfying the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (the Heartstone and the world's magic) is clear, and the cost (Lyra's gift) is paid on the page. However, the external conflict is low-heat since Kael is benevolent, shifting all pressure to the internal struggle, which resolves somewhat quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or trade-offs in pursuing his goal. The resolution arrives via the woman’s serendipitous appearance rather than through an escalation of the archivist's efforts or a confrontation with failure. The stakes remain abstract ("reclaim the narrative") until the external character delivers the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or internal hesitation. The "impossible dare" is resolved without failure or adaptation, making the "perfectly calculated risk" feel stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is external (the storm) rather than interpersonal or internal. The climax—deciding not to throw the tile and instead trying one last time—lacks a felt cost; the solution presents itself conveniently, and the "victory" comes as a gift of magic rather than a price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—ending an eternal existence—is signaled early and resolved clearly. While the stakes are high, the external pressure (the storm) functions more as a tool than an opposing force, making the escalation feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high (life or death), and the internal pressure of committing the "most dishonest thing" is felt. However, the external obstacles are minimal once the decision is made; the procedure itself goes smoothly without escalating complications on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are abstract ("holding back the dark") and lack immediate scene-level pressure. The escalation is external (the sun rising) rather than agent-driven, and the protagonist succeeds through simple concentration without facing a distinct antagonist or forcing a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are primarily existential and atmospheric; while the pressure coheres under the Textural lens, the conflict remains largely internal. The climax effectively synthesized the gathered elements, though the external pressure was relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear and personal—a lifelong obsession versus failure—though the immediate external pressure is relatively low until the climax. The cost is well-defined as a commitment to an "immense, possibly lifelong" task, providing a solid "Charged Poise" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the stakes (gentrification) are clear, the antagonist (the Inspector) offers no active resistance and is defeated by mere confusion, resulting in low conflict pressure. The tension is diffused by the summary format, as the success of the reorganization is told rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear but pressure is low; the environmental threat (cold) is mentioned ("suit’s internal heaters groan") but never forces a tactical change or trade-off. The conflict remains static (waiting), resulting in a lack of meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clear and pressure escalates via the discovery of the deeper fracture and the horn blasts, but the conflict remains purely external and task-based. The protagonist faces no tactical trade-offs or moral dilemmas, only a demand for greater technical exertion, limiting the dramatic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the validation of a life's work versus the skepticism of the world. The escalation is atmospheric and perceptual, building tension through the forming ice rather than external action, which suits the "worrying tranquility" tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is low; the conflict is an abstract struggle between Order and Entropy where the protagonist faces no active opposition. The escalation is textural—more sound, more ghosts—rather than a pressure that forces difficult choices or sacrifices beyond mere exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are absolute and clearly communicated: the choice is between survival and the life's work. The escalation is effective, with the oxygen alarm providing a hard rhythmic counterpoint to the psychic struggle. The ending delivers a high-cost resolution where the protagonist actively chooses the "trophy" over rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the need for personal truth versus the burden of a liar's reputation. The arrival of the coast guard provides effective time pressure, forcing a meaningful choice with lasting cost. High score potential limited only by the global cap from Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no active conflict; Elian faces no difficult choices, and the potential danger of the "poison" never forces a trade-off or tactical shift. The climax is a moment of reception rather than confrontation, resulting in low tension despite the atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate appropriately with the arrival of the storm. The climax forces a transition from passive dreaming to active, costly exertion ("hands bleeding"), satisfying the requirement for protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.1)
    External resistance is minimal; the physical labor is summarized ("painstaking work"), and the emotional stakes are resolved intellectually by the carving without a testing moment. The conflict lacks a pivotal scene of doubt or near-failure; the arrival of the mason removes the primary physical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("discover meaning in the margins") rather than immediate or visceral. There is no antagonist or obstacle; the "distant hum of a sanitation drone" hints at surveillance but provides no actual pressure, leaving Kaelen to execute his plan in perfect safety.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high (a coup), but the immediate pressure on Elara is somewhat abstract; she faces no direct antagonist in the scene, only a "closing window" and a generic "system lag." The lack of an active counter-force reduces the felt cost of her success.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are clear, but the conflict is low-resistance; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned with only standard exhaustion as the cost. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where Elara must make a difficult trade-off during the evocation. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined but the conflict pressure is low; the General’s resistance dissolves too easily upon hearing the translation. The "cost" of the confrontation is minimal, lacking a sense of genuine risk for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the obstacle (fading image) is technical and resolved immediately by the shard without forcing a trade-off. The struggle feels performative, lacking a moment where the protagonist must abandon one value to save another.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the conceptual stakes (certainty vs. curiosity) are clear, the narrative lacks visceral pressure; Elias masters the environment quickly without a moment of genuine peril or risk of failure. The conflict remains largely intellectual, limiting the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high, but the protagonist's victory feels unearned because the potential cost (collateral lobotomy of neighbors) is raised and then ignored in favor of a "glorious silence." The lack of an on-page antagonist beyond generic "sirens" reduces tension to a race against a clock rather than a clash of wills.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract ("pain vs. beauty") with no external pressure to force a decision. The resolution arrives via a spontaneous mood shift ("a truce was being offered") rather than through escalation or a hard choice, resulting in a lack of palpable narrative tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the conceptual stakes (loss of humanity) are high, the on-page conflict is low-pressure; the ritual succeeds without significant obstruction, tactical adjustment, or the genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (the relationship) is clear, but the escalation is internal and procedural; the protagonist battles the difficulty of the spell, which succeeds without complication. The magic removes the risk of misunderstanding, which is the central danger of vulnerability, thereby lowering the effective tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is primarily retrospective, lacking immediate present-tense pressure or a risk of failure that forces a trade-off. The resolution is obtained through a scavenger hunt where the only obstacle is interpreting a clue, resulting in a low-stakes progression that doesn't test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The external pressure (storm/leak) effectively creates a crucible that forces the internal conflict (grief vs. connection) to a head. The stakes—losing the sheet music—are established early, making the scramble to save them feel weighty. The escalation is sharp and resolves naturally into the emotional turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are clear and existential, centered on the survival of realities through separation. The escalation is logical, moving from observation to realization to an irreversible action, with the cost of "no backtracking" visibly paid in the final isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The solution (dimming lights) works instantly without cost or complication, resulting in a low-pressure sequence that lacks a true test of the protagonist's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are established early (fading memory) but remain abstract and external to the protagonist. The escalation moves from a stalled map to a correct guess without forcing Kael to make a difficult trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in low tension and a "clean" victory.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and low-intensity; there is no penalty for failure other than a wasted coin, and no opposition beyond entropy. The tension is strictly procedural ("will the physics work?"), lacking interpersonal or internal pressure. The climax is a moment of wonder, but without a foreclosed alternative or a visible sacrifice, the victory feels unearned in a dramatic sense.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    External stakes (the nostalgia ban) are declared but remain off-screen, leaving the conflict entirely internal and low-pressure. The resolution comes without a difficult choice or sacrifice; the protagonist simply adjusts his technique and succeeds, deflating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension evaporates rather than escalates. The stakes (the destruction of his life's work) are high in theory but are surrendered immediately upon reflection, resulting in a static conflict. The story lacks a tightening of pressure; the "shift" is atmospheric rather than a force that narrows Silas's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is low; Kaelen accepts the lesson immediately, resulting in a lecture dynamic rather than a dramatic exchange with resistance or cost. The stakes are retrospective (the past fire) rather than immediate; no live option is foreclosed in the current scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (a dying reality) is high in concept but abstract in execution; the on-page pressure is limited to watching a needle move. There is no escalation of agency—Elara sets the pattern and waits—and no dilemma forces her to sacrifice one value for another. The conflict is observational rather than participatory.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulation of information builds a quiet intellectual pressure, fitting the textural lens. However, the stakes remain abstract until the end; the conflict is purely retrospective, lacking an immediate, on-page obstacle or time constraint to force the protagonist’s hand earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, external threat, or chance of failure. The time constraint (bells) is met with perfect, unhurried ease, creating a lack of tension or narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes (Forever War) are high in concept but abstract in execution. The conflict is resolved with a single ritual gesture that bypasses the "hard, unyielding soil" promised in the opening; the resistance from Vorlag and Kaelen melts away without a visceral, on-page cost commensurate with the war's scale.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high for the character (redemption/penance), and the cost—the destruction of a unique, priceless object—is visible on the page. The conflict is primarily internal and retrospective; while the thunder provides a subtle ticking clock, the on-page opposition is minimal, relying on a brief moment of hesitation rather than escalating external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is virtually absent, as Elara faces no active opposition, risk of failure, or unintended consequences during the ritual. The escalation is merely sequential (moving from one knot to the next) rather than a tightening of stakes, and the "terrifyingly intimate" nature of the act is stated but not felt through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly internalized; the cost of his "tyranny" is made felt through the memory of the hollow-eyed man. The escalation from defensive intellectualism to genuine moral doubt is well-handled within the short scope. The resolution avoids a binary flip, opting for a nuanced "complication" of the work, which feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under a Situational lens, successfully maintaining a quiet pressure through the waning light and the butterfly migration. However, the stakes remain largely thematic; the physical task lacks urgent jeopardy, and the climax (finishing the knot just in time) feels slightly convenient rather than forcefully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; there is no active opposition or risk of failure on the page. Escalation is indicated only by the passage of time ("hours bled"), lacking a decisive tightening of options or a moment of true jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are immediate and terminal: the loss of the legacy and the protagonist's life. The escalation is handled well via the encroaching storm, forcing a binary choice between passive destruction and active transformation. The cost—physical annihilation for metaphysical presence—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are clear but low-pressure; there is no active opposition, time crunch, or risk of failure during the ritual. The lack of external threat or internal resistance results in a flat escalation curve, relying entirely on atmospheric tension rather than narrative conflict to drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are high in scale but abstract in execution, lacking personal intimacy or visceral danger. The conflict resolution—pressing a magical light into a memory—bypasses the need for a difficult trade-off or clever maneuver. The tension is deflated by the convenience of the tool appearing exactly when the "critical point" is reached.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tension is quiet but potent, relying on the fragility of the breath against the cold. The escalation is well-paced through the rhythmic breathing, though the stakes remain strictly internal/emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Immediate pressure is maintained through the "sickly, discordant hum" perceived via the quartz eye. The stakes are clear: the survival of the Heartwood and Elian’s validation. The escalation from tool failure to the desperate use of the keepsake works well, though the antagonist (the council) remains an off-page abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is sanity and understanding amidst chaos, which generates coherent atmospheric pressure. The escalation is internal—a headache driving a retreat—which fits the cerebral tone but lacks a sharp, externalized turning point where Kaelen risks something concrete. The resolution is satisfying but arrives a bit smoothly without a moment of desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the stakes are globally high ("future crumbling"), the immediate conflict with the Curators lacks dynamic pushback; they yield to a single speech without testing Elara. The "weeks" of research imply effort but skip the struggle, reducing the felt pressure of the obstacle. The climax resolves via philosophical agreement rather than a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Escalation is strong, moving from childhood wish to womb-like unmaking. The stakes (dissolution of identity) are high, though the urgency is occasionally told ("The timeframe was accelerating") rather than purely shown through the degradation of her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tension is low because the protagonist’s competence immediately overwhelms the obstacle; Elias identifies the seal, finds the rope, and performs the weave without a moment of doubt or danger. While the conceptual stakes of a "temporal impossibility" are high, the on-page pressure remains mild.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the stakes (torture by noise) are high, the conflict is static; Kaelen faces environmental resistance but no active antagonism or dilemma. The resolution is achieved through competence rather than a transformative choice or sacrifice, limiting narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes (connection vs. silence) are clear, the conflict is largely external and atmospheric, lacking a sharp, personified pressure or a dilemma that forces a difficult trade-off. The escalation relies on the timeline of the stars rather than agent-driven complications, and the climax—overcoming the "scream" of the shard—is surmounted with relative ease, resulting in a victory that feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The constraint of the fleeting lightning flashes creates effective physical pressure, forcing Kael to act with urgency against a natural timer. The stakes escalate from a technical "discordance" to a profound existential crisis about the nature of his people's history. The cost—the burden of a "terrible and sublime" truth—is felt keenly at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through the protagonist's initial inability to penetrate the fortress's silence. While the stakes are high, the "crushing silence" remains a somewhat abstract antagonist, lacking immediate physical cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established as emotional survival and reframing. The pressure is coherent, though the conflict is resolved almost entirely through internal processing rather than interpersonal friction. The escalation is quiet but distinct, leading to a definitive change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established as a battle for psychological survival, and the ascent provides a physical gauntlet to test Elian's resolve. The escalation works well, though the physical struggle on the trellis is resolved somewhat quickly, relying on the sudden onset of "courage" rather than a specific tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the passenger’s anxiety serves only as a prompt for Elian’s lesson and dissolves immediately upon his explanation. There is no escalation of stakes or meaningful resistance that forces Elian to adapt his tactics, resulting in a low-pressure exchange that lacks dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation relies entirely on the ticking clock (sunrise) rather than evolving obstacles or active opposition. Elara faces no meaningful setbacks or hard choices; the "mystery" dissolves instantly under her skills, resulting in low narrative tension despite the high declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear, but the central conflict is resolved with relatively low friction; the ritual works on the first attempt without complication or cost in the moment. The tension relies heavily on the weight of backstory rather than immediate on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined, but the climax feels rushed due to the story's brevity (falling short of the requested word count). The internal struggle against the Promise's temptation is described rather than dramatized through a difficult choice, and the physical resolution executes too smoothly to maximize tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are internal and clearly defined, but the conflict lacks active opposition or escalation. The pressure is merely physical (the hum) and leads linearly to a solution without forcing a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot; the resolution is given, not seized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential, and the tension escalates effectively through the physical difficulty of the dance. The mechanical precision required for the final "unsnap" creates a tangible, high-pressure focal point for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the pressure is low; the protagonist faces no external resistance and minimal internal conflict in retrieving the object. The resolution feels inevitable rather than forged through difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are established immediately by the network silence, creating clear situational pressure. The tension holds, though the antagonist remains an abstract force; the cost is implied by her exposure but not sharply felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are high in concept ("broken certainties") but low in visceral scene pressure; the antagonist is a passive coded drip that is easily silenced. The resolution is achieved through competence without forcing a painful trade-off or deepening the personal cost beyond established sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or pressure; Elian faces no opposition, failure, or dilemma. The dominant stake (the dying arbor) is resolved instantly by the discovery of the "magic key" object. The climax (a "gentle prod") creates a global fix without any visible or felt price, resulting in flat tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are purely intellectual/philosophical with minimal pressure or risk; Elias faces no opposition, time limit, or physical danger. The escalation is a straight line of problem-solving without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off, resulting in a low-tension "cozy" mystery feel rather than a dramatic crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established as a battle between despair and meaning, escalating through the ritual's physical toll. The cost is legible—both the spent energy and the acceptance of the "crushing weight"—providing a solid causal backbone.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is low; the antagonist (the spirit's grief) recoils once but offers no sustained opposition to Silas's methods. The stakes remain abstract because the potential for failure is never viscerally felt, and the resolution is achieved without a significant trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the psychological pressure is evident, the conflict remains largely intellectual and abstract ("solve the equation"), lacking visceral, on-page stakes that force difficult trade-offs. The escalation is textural—increasing hum, clearer memories—rather than a tightening of options that forces a sacrifice. The "perish in the static" threat feels declared rather than demonstrated through immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract (historical truth vs. concealment) with minimal personal risk to the protagonist. The opposition is static (pigment), and the climax resolves through exertion ("wrenching pull") rather than a meaningful trade-off or loss. The ending ("lens... felt suddenly lighter") signals relief rather than the required cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are low; the ghost is explicitly described as "harmless," and the primary antagonist is merely a "rickety" ladder. The "moment of choice" is rhetorically framed but lacks a felt cost or risk—Leo sacrifices nothing to climb the ladder, making the victory feel unearned by pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are high in concept (existence/eternity) but low in dramatic tension, as there is no active opposition or risk of failure on the page. The "cost" (destruction of the library) is exactly what the protagonist desires, meaning there is no "felt price" or sacrifice required to achieve the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    External stakes are low; the threat of the "chorus of ghosts" is managed easily with velvet cloths, and the rival Valerius is an abstract, off-page presence. The primary conflict is resolved too neatly by the shard's vision, lacking a moment where the protagonist's theory is genuinely tested or where he must pay a price to prove it.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict is intellectualized rather than dramatized; the antagonist is a disembodied voice that is defeated by a single thought. There is no escalation of tactical difficulty, and the victory is total and immediate, lacking the back-and-forth pressure or visible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    While external tension is low, the internal stakes are clearly defined and escalate to a meaningful philosophical trade-off. The cost is paid in the renunciation of the prize (the scent) and the tool (the compass), satisfying the requirement for felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.0)
    External stakes are high (survival), but the resolution comes too easily via the magical diagram. The barrier construction lacks a sense of desperate struggle or trade-off; the "simple solution" dissolves the threat without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract (satisfying curiosity) with no external pressure, antagonist, or ticking clock beyond a metaphorical season change. The protagonist faces no trade-offs; she invests time and supplies but risks nothing, resulting in a climax that feels like solving a puzzle rather than surviving an ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are intimate but high, grounded in the "weeks" of entrapment and the physical toll on Kaelen. While the antagonist is static by design, the pressure is successfully internalized, and the escalation from futile questioning to the final offering feels earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, focusing on the mental exertion required to sustain the memories. While functional under the Accumulative lens, the stakes feel somewhat insulated; success appears inevitable once the process begins, with the cost described as "exhaustion" rather than dramatized through near-failure or distinct trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate vertically from a professional disturbance to an existential threat against the entire populace. The conflict is coherent; the antagonist is the silence itself (and what it hides), and the protagonist's realization of his own complicity adds a layer of sharp, ironic pressure. The final cost—destroying the history he loved—is visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.7)
    The antagonist (entropy) yields immediately to the protagonist's first tactic, offering no tactical resistance. While the declared stakes are high (reality dying), the lack of escalation or near-failure flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    Escalation relies almost entirely on a mechanical countdown and atmospheric intensity rather than active opposition or evolving tactical dilemmas. The protagonist encounters no unexpected obstacles, making the climax feel like the inevitable execution of a plan rather than a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The internal stakes are clear and escalate appropriately from detached observation to risky empathy. The pressure is consistent with the genre, though the conflict remains entirely internal without external friction or tangible cost beyond the emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.7)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, difficult trade-off, or rising pressure, merely following instructions to dig. The "cost" of opening the box is described abstractly ("reverence that felt like trespass") rather than felt through a difficult choice or tangible consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly established—Kael is running out of time—but the resolution comes with low cost. He gains transcendence and answers without a painful sacrifice or trade-off; the "garage sale" tactic yields the perfect answer with minimal opposition. The ending feels more like a reward for patience than the result of a difficult struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal and purely internal; the "distress" of the kite snapping is observed from a distance and aestheticized immediately. There is no escalation of stakes for the protagonist, who faces no risk of failure or loss in his "tending" of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-voltage; while the deadline is set, the execution of the project faces no on-page resistance, error, or adaptation. The protagonist moves in a straight line from plan to success without a tightening of options or meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are primarily internal but clearly defined; the tension between Aris's intellectual identity and the "silent imperative" of the path drives the narrative. The escalation relies on the situational pressure of the walk and the accumulating evidence of the footprints, culminating in a meaningful trade-off of his prized object.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high conceptually (life vs. entropy) but low dramatically; the scene lacks immediate pressure or opposition, reading as a serene ritual rather than a struggle. There is no moment where failure seems possible or where the protagonist must sacrifice something significant beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are clear but the external pressure remains low; the journey across the wasteland is summarized rather than dramatized with high-cost obstacles. The conflict is primarily internal and navigational, lacking a sharp intensification before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved without a visible cost or difficult trade-off. The escalation is linear (feeling stretched → sketching → vision) and lacks a moment where Elara must risk something to achieve her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is declared ("twisting the celestial clock") but not felt in the scene; Kael faces no meaningful opposition from Sylas or the environment. The lack of a trade-off, loss, or difficult choice renders the victory hollow and the conflict telescopic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is distinct and effectively paced, moving from the subtle tension of the "breaking bone" click to the high-stakes risk of Elara's coded walking. The pressure builds coherently, forcing the protagonist to abandon her safety (her mask) to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a dilemma requiring sacrifice. The resolution is achieved through a sudden insight and a convenient object, missing the opportunity for a high-stakes choice or a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Internal stakes are high and escalate clearly as Elias confronts the tapestry; the cost (abandoning the illusion of perfection) is legible. The external tension mirrors the internal struggle effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The impending ritual creates effective situational pressure that forces the protagonist's hand. The final choice to remain and face the Wardens demonstrates agency and accepts a visible cost, validating the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation is present as Elara moves from the base to the heart of the statue, but the external threat (the leviathan) remains passive background scenery rather than an active pressure. The resolution—a burst of light that repels the darkness—resolves the conflict too easily, dissipating tension without forcing a difficult trade-off beyond the conceptual choice of narration.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are purely internal and retrospective; the environment offers little resistance, yielding the "perfect" spot immediately after a minor deviation. The lack of external pressure or a moment where the promise is genuinely tested keeps the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is static; the opposing worldview (Hemlock) is physically dormant, and the environmental obstacle (fog) yields immediately to the protagonist's will. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options, as the first tactic employed succeeds without forcing a trade-off or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or difficult trade-offs, merely complying with instructions. The success of the device on the first try lacks a "try-fail" cycle or a visible, dramatized cost paid in the moment beyond trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the preservation of a cherished memory against the erosion of forced honesty. The escalation during the storm effectively merges external danger with internal vulnerability, and the resolution provides a satisfying release of that specific pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are low and internal; there is no tangible cost to failure and no escalating opposition. The "investigation" consists of repetitive, risk-free actions (holding the flower) that yield results without forcing the protagonist to trade anything of value.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (keeping the promise vs. the danger of the creek). The external pressure of the rising water provides good initial tension. However, the climax relies on the magical object explaining the theme to Elias rather than him making a difficult, cost-laden choice to reject the alternate lives.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes (identity vs. dissolution) are high and escalate clearly through the climb. The final confrontation with the "bleeding starlight" provides a solid pressure point that forces the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    The pressure is coherent and escalates appropriately from professional frustration to personal loss. The dominant stake (capturing presence) is recontextualized by the threat of Kael's departure. The cost is felt—the surrender of intellectual safety for emotional exposure—though the mechanism of the solution is somewhat low-resistance once the choice is made.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—psychological coherence vs. temporal chaos—is established early and escalated well through the "feral nostalgia." The tension releases through the flight sequence, which effectively recontextualizes the struggle, though the lack of an external pressure valve limits the complexity of the final "cost."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear (emotional peace for the client, validation for the protagonist), but the conflict is gentle. The "opposition" is merely the silence of the object, which yields its secrets readily to Elara’s touch. A sharper moment of resistance or misinterpretation before the breakthrough would have heightened the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are established well through the physical manifestation of stress. However, the conflict dissolves instantly upon the realization, lacking a struggle or trade-off that usually characterizes high-end literary climaxes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined: the physical destruction of the archive (ticking clock) vs. the need for emotional resolution. The trade-off—dignity and privacy for a chance at connection—is a strong, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks active opposition or tension; the universe has already agreed to end, leaving the protagonist to merely sign the paperwork. While the stakes are existential (being vs. non-being), the absence of struggle or doubt renders the climax passive. The "tether" of the book offers a glimpse of conflict, but it is released without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established—the integrity of the Grand Chronometer versus the anomaly. The escalation is psychological and sensory, narrowing focus to the microscopic shard. The resolution involves a meaningful choice to renounce control, which registers as a significant moment of Earned Stasis within the character's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Narrative pressure is low; Kael controls the environment, the tool, and the timing without active opposition or risk of failure. The escalation is procedural—he aims and fires—rather than a rising tide of stakes or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is intellectual and emotional closure, but the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or setbacks; the path from clue to solution is linear and smooth. The cost is purely conceptual ("giving up certainty") without a visceral, on-page price paid for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the stakes of the suicide call are high, the escalation is intellectualized through the "semantic engineer" frame and largely summarized. The tension dissipates during the time jump rather than tightening through specific, on-page beats of resistance and breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.2)
    The stated stakes (a bitter feud) are never dramatized or felt on the page, only summarized. The climax lacks resistance; the antagonist immediately accepts the truth, and magical intervention removes the need for a difficult choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clear and escalate coherently from silent apathy to the tension of the gathering crowd ("mob or a community"). The protagonist's intervention effectively reweights the outcome under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict is primarily man-versus-environment/self, but the obstacles are overcome with competence and endurance rather than costly trade-offs. The "crushing soundscape" is mentioned but never forces Kaelen to abandon a tool, a memory, or a part of himself to proceed; he simply focuses harder. The lack of a distinct turning point where failure is a real possibility flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high (saving a colony vs. preserving reality), but the escalation is theoretical rather than felt. The potential disasters resulting from his edits are listed in summary rather than experienced as immediate pressures, which keeps the conflict at a cerebral remove.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are abstract (silence vs. music) and the opposition remains passive until the final beat where silence becomes "aggressive." The cost is described as emotional labor ("desperate, beautiful ballet") but lacks visceral on-page consequence or the threat of failure; victory feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The emotional stakes are high and sustained, centered on the redemption of the sister’s memory. The tension escalates appropriately from the initial search to the confrontation with the defaced painting. The cost—a life of isolation and the weight of the new task—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal pressure is palpable, escalating effectively through the complexity of the drumming and the visual response of the machine. However, the lack of external obstacles (security, time limits) keeps the stakes purely emotional, resulting in a climax that feels physically low-risk despite its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    The antagonist Kaelen is a straw man whose incompetence poses no genuine threat to Silas, draining the scene of tension. Because Silas wins without sacrifice or difficult trade-offs, the stakes remain abstract and professional rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.0)
    The conflict is abstract ("lonely darkness") and the opposition is passive, resulting in low tension. The protagonist faces no significant obstacles; the water "trembles" but does not threaten, and the resolution comes without a trade-off or escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric and abstract; the "Authority" is a faceless concept rather than an on-page antagonist applying immediate pressure. While the stakes (cultural homogenization) are clear, the lack of a direct, proximate threat (e.g., a patrol, a specific risk of arrest) keeps the tension in a "safe" zone. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes evaporate upon contact with the protagonist's magic item; the sister's resistance is the primary obstacle and is removed instantly by the scrimshaw. There is no escalation of cost; the summoning succeeds on the first attempt without failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The external pressure of the turbines and the implied threat of the mandate provide a constant, coherent backdrop for the internal struggle. The shift from narrating to whittling serves as a meaningful tightening of focus, though the stakes remain largely internal and static throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible opposition; the "madness" mentioned is theoretical and never manifests to challenge Kael. The stakes remain abstract, and the resolution is achieved immediately upon applying his method, lacking the escalation required for a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict is introduced and immediately resolved by the protagonist's pre-existing inventory and skill, bypassing any escalation or narrowing of options. There is no moment where failure seems possible or where a significant price is paid; the "impossible" task is rendered easy too quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.9)
    The conflict is purely technical and lacks immediate urgency, opposition, or consequence; the stakes remain abstract ("texture of connection") throughout. There is no escalation of pressure on the page; the protagonist solves the problem in a single smooth motion once the idea occurs to him, with no risk of failure or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no resistance from the recipient, the environment, or his own grief during the intervention. The absence of a tightening beat or risk of failure flattens the narrative drive into a procedural success sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Conflict is intellectual rather than visceral; while the explanation deepens understanding, the lack of active opposition or risk to the protagonist limits narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear and the cost (loss of self) is legible at the end. However, the escalation is smooth; the ritual succeeds without a moment of near-failure or tactical pivot, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are high and personal, focused on a binary choice with irreversible consequences (delete vs. integrate). The cost is legible and felt: the loss of the idealized "happy" memory in exchange for a "fragile" truth.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming self-respect without losing compassion—is clear, but the external pressure of the fitting is relatively low. The resolution arrives smoothly; a sharper, more resistant obstacle during the procedure would have heightened the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Internal stakes are expertly braided with the external reaction of the ivy; the pressure escalates as Elias tunnels deeper into the memory. The cost is palpable—a “raw, vibrating agony” that destroys his hope for simple healing. The resolution does not solve the pain but forces him to carry it, a distinct and heavy price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent for the protagonist; Elara faces no antagonist, time limit, or internal dilemma that forces a trade-off. While the flashback contains emotional pressure for Arthur, it does not transfer to Elara's present-tense experience or jeopardize her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is flat; the psychic static is a constant background pressure that does not intensify or force a desperate tactical shift before the resolution. The solution arrives via external delivery (the meteor's message) rather than through an escalation of the protagonist's efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the dune's integrity—is clear, and the intrusion of the memory provides coherent pressure. However, the escalation is linear; Kaelen manages the threat with elegant control rather than facing a "dark night of the soul" or a forced trade-off. The victory feels inevitable due to high competence, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes remain strictly philosophical and abstract, with no external pressure or time constraints to force the protagonist's evolution. The escalation is merely spatial proximity to the tree, and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-stakes decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and largely internal, without external opposition to test the protagonist's resolve. The journey up the hill is a guided tour rather than a struggle; the guides provide the answers and the ticket, removing the burden of discovery from Elara until the summary conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is internal but potent, moving from the passive "low-voltage accusation" of his nerves to the active decision to confront his guilt. The stakes are legible: he risks his sanctuary for the chance of authentic healing. The tension holds effectively under the Situational/Accumulative lens without needing external melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    Tension is low because the protagonist faces no active opposition; the "war of whispers" is backstory, and the "pretender" is a distant concept rather than a present threat. The constraint of the "shifting constellations" implies a clock, but Kael moves with such assured competence that the risk of failure never feels genuine. The stakes are cosmic, but the scene itself lacks immediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.7)
    The stakes are clear but the on-page cost is low; the "rare confluence" provides a window, but the protagonist's initial failure has no lasting consequence before he immediately succeeds. The conflict resolves through a sudden observation rather than a sacrifice or painful adaptation, reducing the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high (reigniting a rebellion) but low in the scene, as the environment offers no resistance. The protagonist faces no active opposition or time pressure beyond a static window, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal. Elara faces no active opposition, time pressure, or environmental hazard; the natural world collaborates with her instantly. Without a moment where success is in doubt or a trade-off is forced, the stakes remain abstract ("future of humanity") rather than viscerally felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internal but made palpable through physical symptoms and the tactile engagement with the photograph. The escalation from sound to paralysis to active grounding provides a clear pressure gradient that is resolved through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Internal pressure is established early via the claustrophobic wall metaphor. The conflict is resolved through agency, but the opposition yields a bit too easily to the creative act; the ending lacks a sense of lingering danger or sacrifice, settling for a "quiet, resilient sense."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tension between immediate communal duty (the rockslide rescue) and Kael's esoteric hunt creates effective pressure and stakes. While the external conflict is low-key—the drone is a passive target—the time constraint of the evaporating ink successfully forces the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high but the opposition remains abstract; the Council is a distant concept rather than a felt pressure in the room. The escalation is internal, but the lack of an immediate obstacle softens the tension of the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are legible—her peace versus the lure of her heritage—but the "temptation" to use the knife feels slightly manufactured given her "systematic rejection" of that life. The pressure is largely atmospheric and internal (memory/scent) rather than an urgent external threat, which keeps the escalation relatively mild. However, the choice to keep/hide the knife rather than destroy it adds a layer of nuanced complication.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    Tension is dampened by the protagonist's unflappability; when a shockwave shatters a sculpture, he "did not flinch," which lowers the stakes immediately. The "impossible task" offers little resistance to his specific skillset, resolving without a moment of doubt or failure. Without a visible, on-page cost or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt, the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high (posthumous ruin), but the scene lacks visceral pressure because the antagonist folds immediately. The journalist serves as a passive receiver of Celeste's logic rather than an active opponent, turning the conflict into a lecture rather than a duel. While the dismantling is satisfying, a more spirited defense from the journalist would have heightened the cost of Celeste's victory.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist faces minimal external resistance or complication; the solution is procedural and executed without significant doubt, risk, or a "try-fail" cycle. The emotional stakes are high, but the on-page struggle is low.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric and internal, lacking active opposition or urgent external pressure. The antagonist is the abstract concept of "unlearning" or "hush," which provides a backdrop but does not force the protagonist into a corner or demand a painful trade-off until the final gesture. The stakes remain high-concept ("meaning") rather than visceral, resulting in a soft narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are high (identity vs. sanity), and the pressure of the "Retro's" suffering drives the scene. However, the conflict is largely one-sided; Kaelen acts upon a passive subject, and the "battle" is internal to the patient. The external opposition is minimal, relying on the inherent difficulty of the task rather than active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation works well under the Accumulative lens, moving from small sensory details to a "finale" of applause that decisively shifts the mood. While effective, the lack of any complication or resistance creates a somewhat frictionless ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes—connection versus isolation—are felt intensely through the somatic focus. Elias's escalation from painting grief to painting love forces him to abandon his skepticism in favor of emotional truth. The cost is the surrender of his intellectual rigidity, a price he willingly pays for the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain largely abstract; the "overwhelming" energy is described but does not threaten Elara with a palpable consequence of failure beyond a blank map. The escalation is textural rather than pressure-based, resolving comfortably without forcing a difficult trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    The draining hourglass creates effective ticking-clock pressure that forces the protagonist's work to a crisis point. The stakes are legible, and the resolution is driven by the protagonist's completed labor.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Tension is maintained through the fragility of the meeting and the high stakes of the "Vienna network." While the conflict is primarily off-stage (the enemy closing in), the on-page pressure of the fragile communication holds the scene together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low and purely internal; the conflict is resolved by a convenient intellectual reframing rather than a forced tactical choice or visible cost. The stakes feel abstract despite the emotional weight implies.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure escalates via the intensifying "thrum," but the stakes remain abstract and the opposition (entropy) is passive. The protagonist faces no significant setbacks or agonizing trade-offs; the "cost" is merely a skipped meal, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pressure is coherent but low-voltage; the conflict is primarily man vs. environment (darkness/cold), lacking active opposition until the final response. While the cost (time, cold) is mentioned, the montage summary dampens the visceral feeling of that cost, keeping the stakes gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is entirely internal and abstract (sanity vs. isolation), lacking external pressure or escalation tactics. The resolution comes too easily once the ritual begins, missing a moment of doubt or sacrifice that would heighten the stakes beyond mere decision.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of connection is clear and pressured by the observation of others. While the "terror" of the choice is stated, the escalation feels somewhat smooth; the hesitation is brief and the external pressure minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the societal stakes are high (civil unrest), the immediate pressure on the protagonist is low; she operates from a safe sanctuary, watching the danger on a monitor. The climax involves executing a prepared plan without unexpected resistance or a forced sacrifice, resulting in a low-cost victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is coherent, moving from spatial distortion to violent frenzy, but the resolution lacks a felt cost. The threat dissolves instantly upon the action, granting a total victory without the requisite sacrifice or trade-off expected at this level of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly established (dormant empathy) and the pressure escalates coherently through the painting process. The conflict is primarily internal, manifested through the struggle to reconcile the "festive silk" with the "unforgiving stone." While effective, the external pressure is atmospheric rather than active, keeping the tension relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared abstractly but never tested in scene; Elias encounters no genuine resistance from the environment, the Guild, or his own limitations. The absence of a visible or felt cost flattens the narrative tension, as success is granted without trade-offs or significant risk.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly internalized: the safety of his "familiar bridge-songs" versus the dangerous "question mark" of the new method. The pressure escalates naturally from the "lingering ozone" of the inciting incident to the decisive action of playing the new rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    The conflict is clear, but the stakes feel lopsided as Elias faces no genuine risk of failure or loss. The resolution preserves his sanctuary without exacting a "felt price," resulting in a lack of tension; the victory is total and relatively painless.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are internal and stated ("generations of obsession") rather than demonstrated through immediate pressure or risk. The conflict resolves relatively easily through the dream epiphany; the "cost" of the resolution is minimal, as the character transitions smoothly from struggle to peace without a harder trade-off or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are established early, and the escalation through the "expanding circles" ritual provides a clear ramp of pressure. The cost—Elara's own emotional walls cracking in sympathy with the branch—is legible, though the opposition remains largely static until the final exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established as a binary between "re-knitting" existence and oblivion. The pressure from the "siren's call" is tangible, but the protagonist overcomes the obstacle somewhat easily through competence and a magical tool. A greater felt cost or sacrifice would heighten the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established early and escalated effectively when the shadow threatens the sapling. The resolution avoids a generic fight scene, instead utilizing a thematic sacrifice (feeding the void) that aligns perfectly with the established rules. The cost of losing the memory of his acceptance letter is poignant and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding value in a painful past—is tightened effectively through the physical resistance of the snagged cloth. The struggle serves as a solid objective correlative for his internal fight, though the phrase "absurdly monumental" tells the reader the weight of the moment rather than letting the action carry it entirely. The resolution forecloses the path of avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the stakes of grief are clear, the story lacks immediate, on-page escalation or external pressure. The conflict is resolved through a single, unimpeded action (planting the seed) that yields an instant answer, missing the opportunity for a "meaningful tightening" of options.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is coherent under an Accumulative/Ritual lens, provided by the rising tide and the internal heat. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("preserving wonder"), and the "cost" described ("searing pain") feels like a standard operating expense rather than a price that alters the protagonist's path or forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are high but abstract (isolation vs. connection), and the opposition is entirely internal. The climax hinges on a single hesitation where "fear screamed," but there is no external pressure or tangible cost to the choice, making the resolution feel low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.5)
    The internal pressure of withdrawal and grief creates a solid baseline of tension. However, the escalation is cut short when the graffiti resolves the struggle for him. The final act of leaving the instrument is a strong, costly choice that redeems the ending, but the turning point lacks earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is driven by the puzzle's difficulty rather than active opposition or dilemma; the "lie" is a stated stake that is never tested on the page. The climax offers emotional release but lacks a hard trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a trade-off between imperial prestige and personal integrity, with the "impending solstice address" adding necessary time pressure. The climax—propagating the vine and altering the report—carries a tangible cost (loss of career and safety) that is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "chaos" of the universe is described but offers no dramatic resistance to Elara's "honed intuition." She succeeds immediately upon trying, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral or escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are clear but pressure is low; the protagonist overcomes her internal hesitation instantly without testing or failure. The conflict is resolved through a single decisive action that faces no external resistance, reducing the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clear and the "mirror of the void" creates a sharp turning point. However, Kaelen's resistance is overcome somewhat easily by the narrator's monologue, reducing the feeling of active struggle before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The external stake (finding the sister) anchors the abstract lesson, providing necessary pressure. The conflict is successfully internalized, with the escalation occurring through the vision that forces Kael to confront his own counter-productive ego.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are low and largely abstract; the "discordant thrum" is a nuisance rather than a threat. Kaelan faces no genuine opposition or risk of failure, resulting in a flat escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are established, but the escalation is minimal; two failed diagnostic attempts lead immediately to the solution. The cost is symbolic (dropping the pack) rather than viscerally felt, resulting in a resolution that feels too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the internal stakes are high, the external dive lacks sufficient obstacles; the descent feels physically safe despite the mention of pressure. The epiphany in the library comes somewhat easily, relying on a meditative realization rather than a struggle against the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly articulated through the risk of sensor burnout and absolute isolation. The escalation during the tuning sequence adds necessary pressure, though the resolution comes relatively swiftly after the single decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined; the pressure comes from the risk of being consumed by "shapeless agony." The escalation is quiet but focused, narrowing down to the fading sunlight and the precise moment of the ritual. The cost is felt—the resulting crystal is "imperfect" and "webbed with fractures," a compromise rather than a cure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clear, and the contrast between the grand ambition and the small tool (broken bell) generates good tension. The escalation is somewhat static—a repetitive struggle—until the sudden breakthrough, lacking a "tightening" beat where the cost of failure increases before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is largely internal and summarized; the "vigil" and research lack on-page resistance or opposition. The climax ("His hands did not shake") explicitly removes tension from the final act, making the stakes feel asserted rather than viscerally felt or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is internal, but the escalation lacks acute pressure; the protagonist transitions from frustration to success without encountering a significant obstacle or risk of failure in the scene. The cost of the transformation is abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are established as high (colony safety), but the primary obstacle—a trembling hand—is overcome relatively easily via the memento. The cost of the victory is described as a "hollow ache," which tells rather than dramatizes a significant price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central conflict is present, but the antagonist offers little resistance at the peak; Jin's capitulation to the "mesmerizing" light renders the "custody battle" low-pressure and resolves the external threat too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    Narrative pressure is low; the mystery is resolved without setbacks, risks, or meaningful obstacles. The protagonist faces no genuine threat or possibility of failure, making the escalation feel purely theoretical rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the risk of disrupting the family's fragile peace versus the need to break their stagnation. The escalation through the three pulls of the engine cord creates tangible pressure that pays off in the family's reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are intensely personal and clearly defined: the comfort of home versus the integrity of reality. The pressure escalates naturally from the pendant's subtle hum to the violent tearing of the portal. The cost is legible on the page—Lyel permanently forecloses his return to end the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined and the pressure escalates appropriately with the failing light and dwindling fragments. The resolution dissolves the tension effectively, though the cost is largely conceptual (surrender of will) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is coherent, driven by the timeline of the perigee and the increasing system pressure. However, the stakes remain primarily professional and abstract; the protagonist’s high agency leads to a solution that feels essentially cost-free, limiting the tension's peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain theoretical; there is no antagonist, time limit (clocks are broken), or resource scarcity to force a trade-off. Finn solves the problem through observation alone, facing no obstacles that require a painful choice or a change in tactics, resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear—mastery over the medium versus the volatility of memory—and the cost is paid in full at the end with the coldness of the connection. The escalation is functional, though the struggle phase is brief; the shift from warm to cold memory provides the necessary tightening of the screw.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict remains intellectual and theoretical; the opposition (Director Valerius) exists only in backstory, leaving the present scene without active pressure. Escalation is a straight line to success, missing a moment where failure is a genuine, felt option.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.9)
    Escalation is minimal; the "intensifying" pulse signals urgency, but the protagonist faces no obstacle in delivering the message, and the recipient offers no resistance. The conflict resolves through a simple conversation, lacking the tightening of options or the "meaningful deepening" required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the tide and claustrophobia provide initial pressure, the protagonist's ability to simply phase through the rock deflates the physical stakes. The conflict is resolved through a superpower rather than a hard choice or sacrifice, rendering the threat negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the breakthrough moment ("Then, something shifted") occurs without a tightening of options or a forced trade-off. The conflict resolves through patience rather than a high-stakes choice or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than causal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, risk of failure, or necessary sacrifice. The potential stake of the "cursed" diamond is dismissed as a misunderstanding, removing the tension required for a high-stakes climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear, but the climax is largely observational; the protagonist watches another’s transformation to learn his lesson rather than forcing the outcome through his own agency. The resolution is earned intellectually but lacks a visceral, high-stakes trade-off played out in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is present but low-stakes; the protagonist faces the Wardens and succeeds by simply intensifying her effort, a linear escalation without a tactical trade-off. The "exhaustion" mentioned in the aftermath is a told cost, not a felt price paid during the confrontation to secure victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure relies on a countdown rather than active opposition; the protagonist succeeds without facing a new obstacle or paying a personal price, limiting escalation to a linear execution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear but low-pressure; the conflict is internal and largely meditative. The climax, while beautiful, feels somewhat inevitable rather than earned through difficult choices or rising tension. The "feeling too vast" that "surges through him" externalizes the resolution, bypassing a moment of active agency or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; there is no active antagonist, time pressure, or internal resistance to the ritual. The narrative follows a linear path of execution—setup, action, result—without a meaningful tightening of options or a moment where failure seems possible. The patron’s brief notice offers a flicker of tension, but it is dismissed immediately, leaving the stakes largely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes remain static and internal; the only obstacle is the wait for the right weather, which resolves without protagonist agency or sacrifice. There is no escalation of pressure, and the "cost" is relegated to off-page backstory, leaving the climax feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.0)
    The antagonist ("fear") offers no effective resistance, crumbling immediately before the Locksmith's perfected technique. There is no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options; the protagonist simply waits, acts, and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are personal and clear, but the cost of the decision is mild; Elias breaks a rule and immediately receives a profound reward with only a "hollow ache" as the price. A sharper trade-off or risk would heighten the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are palpable; Kael’s terror (walking backwards) effectively raises the pressure of the "return," transforming a simple lesson into a life-or-death warning. The conflict escalates naturally from a knot in twine to the "impossible knot" of returning home.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict; the "creeping greyness" is a passive condition that offers no resistance to the protagonist's efforts. With no antagonist, internal doubt, or possibility of failure, the story lacks narrative tension and reads more like a ritual summary than a scene under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (creation unraveling), and the local pressure of the "angry sorrow" provides immediate tension. However, the physical obstacle—the knot itself—yields somewhat easily to a "gentle twist" and "calm," missing an opportunity for a grittier, more costly struggle during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and purely intellectual ("landscape of knowledge"), with no tangible cost for failure or time pressure. The protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs; the investigation proceeds smoothly to its conclusion. Without a "felt cost" or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; the physical obstacles (opening a lock) are minor, and the central mystery is resolved by the father's letter rather than the protagonist's struggle. The ending is a decision of inaction (leaving the globe) that feels intellectually justified but lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The external pressure of the storm window creates effective urgency, fueling the pacing. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract—Lyra's "loneliness" is stated rather than dramatized as an immediate crisis—and the protagonist succeeds without a significant, permanent sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are primarily internal and clearly defined, escalating as the elevator rises. The cost is subtle but felt—the weight of a secret knowledge that separates Kael from his role as a simple servant—though the external pressure is relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation works well on the emotional axis, moving from hesitation to grief to a powerful, complex vitality. However, the physical stakes of the "string break" and drifting are accepted so quickly that they generate little friction, relying entirely on the internal quest for tension. The climax provides a thematic breakthrough but lacks a difficult, cost-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The external pressure of the wrecking crew creates a palpable ticking clock that escalates tension effectively throughout the single scene. The conflict between the finite time remaining and the infinite scope of the task drives the pacing. The protagonist's choice to remain and complete the work carries a felt cost of physical danger, charging the final moment of stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined but purely external; the conflict is a linear puzzle-solving sequence lacking genuine jeopardy or hard choices. The protagonist faces no significant setbacks or necessary sacrifices, failing the rubric's requirement for a tightening that forces a trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are clear (the Orrery must be fixed), but the conflict is resolved with high competence and minimal friction. Elara has the exact tools and knowledge required; while using the guarded essence implies a cost, the text explicitly states she "did not hesitate," removing the weight of the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is strictly external and logistical; the protagonists face physical exertion but no difficult trade-offs or moral dilemmas. The solution is provided entirely by the ghost's diagrams, removing the burden of discovery from the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (peace vs. oblivion) is clear, but the conflict is purely external and passive (entropy). There is no active opposition or internal reluctance to test the protagonist's resolve; the "cost" of his essence is paid automatically as part of the ritual, lacking a decisive moment of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are established early, and the frost serves as an effective time constraint. While the cost is ostensibly high (consuming the nut), the ease of the device's activation ("Push button -> Win") and the ambiguity regarding the resource's replaceability soften the impact of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes are clear, the narrative lacks meaningful escalation or resistance; the protagonist's rigid mindset dissolves too easily in the face of the river metaphor. The conflict is resolved through observation rather than a high-stakes choice or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; Elian’s fear of being "fraudulent" is an internal state that faces no external test or deadline. The climax involves a symbolic action (cutting a tree) that yields immediate positive results ("awakening") with no felt personal cost or trade-off, flattening the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the Warlord’s individual grief to the collective sorrow of the pavilion. The stakes are visceral ("pulverize his bones"), though the physical struggle to reach the pavilion is minimal compared to the metaphysical weight of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared ("communal spirit fractured") but remain abstract and distant. The escalation is mechanical—inputting code, then song—and the resolution comes without a significant sacrifice or trade-off from the protagonist. The conflict resolves because the protagonist is competent, not because he paid a price to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (self-dissolution), but the opposition remains abstract ("storm of ghosts," "entangled memories"). The escalation relies on internal description of effort rather than forcing a difficult tactical trade-off, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is maintained through the environmental clock (gravity reversal), but the climax relies on the protagonist's inherent ability rather than a new tactic or sacrifice. The resolution feels earned by competence rather than cost, making the victory feel slightly inevitable. The external threat is palpable, but the internal stakes are low.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; there is no active opposition, risk of failure, or escalating pressure to force a decision. The stakes remain abstract, and the protagonist overcomes the "silence" with immediate proficiency, flattening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and internal; there is no risk of failure or external pressure beyond the setting sun. The protagonist faces no active opposition, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external pressure of the fireworks effectively escalates the internal task of tuning the device. The conflict deepens nicely when Elias realizes the silence is not sorrow but protective love, a meaningful shift in understanding that drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are internal but palpable—the risk of losing the seed's progress or her own sanity to the sensory overload. The escalation is sharp ("riot of smells"), though the resolution comes via a relatively quick internal pivot rather than a prolonged struggle or external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are declared (saving the trees) but remain external; the protagonist faces physical danger but no moral or emotional trade-offs. The conflict escalates linearly without a deepening of the character's stance or a moment where she must choose between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are intellectual and clear, but the escalation is linear; Kaelen moves from point A to point B without facing a dilemma that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The tension dissolves rather than peaks because the solution arrives via an unearned data leap rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "sculpted hush" is a passive condition that offers no resistance to Kael's actions. The stakes are declared globally ("world not truly living") but never tested on the page against active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—the need to understand a past failure—is signaled early and maintained. While the internal pressure is consistent, the external conflict is relatively passive (the canyon's silence), meaning the escalation depends entirely on the ritual steps without active pushback until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear: Elias seeks data, Anya seeks relief. The escalation through the mechanical process creates adequate tension. The cost—Anya's alienation from her own grief—is a sophisticated, felt price that elevates the resolution beyond a simple fix.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    The declared stake of "being followed" never materializes into an on-page test, rendering the external tension hollow. The conflict resolves through a wondrous event that happens *to* the character, lacking escalation driven by agency or a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally as the sun rises. The cost is not physical harm but the devastation of a cherished belief, which is rendered viscerally on the page through the stark mechanical imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high—total erasure of memory—and the final cost is effectively rendered. However, the central conflict is purely internal and largely retrospective; the immediate obstacle is a hesitation resolved before the scene fully activates.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early and escalated through the physical descent and the psychological weight of the silk. The conflict resolves through a high-agency choice where the cost—the loss of specific sensory memories—is viscerally felt, satisfying the highest standard for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate sharply from a personal, melancholy quest to a tangible structural threat, managed well within the short word count. The cost is palpable and thematic: by saving his reality, Kael must silence the echoes that connected him to his sister, trading intimacy for safety.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the execution of the conflict lacks on-page pressure. The physical danger of the crossing is elided in summary, and the mechanical obstacle of the broken light offers no resistance, reducing the earned cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("shape a new dawn") with no dramatized consequence for failure; the storm acts as passive raw material rather than active opposition. Kaelan remains in total control throughout, resulting in a scene with intensity but zero conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and purely internal; there is no opposition or risk of failure, only curiosity. The escalation is gentle—moving from observation to a polite conversation—lacking a pressure point that forces a difficult trade-off or exposes the protagonist to meaningful consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are internal and thematic rather than dramatic; there is no tangible opposition or risk of failure. While the storm provides atmospheric pressure, the protagonist’s success is never in doubt, leading to a flat conflict curve without meaningful escalation or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("dying realm") but never tested by opposition; the protagonist encounters no resistance while gathering the songs or performing the ritual. The absence of a "moment of truth" where failure is possible flattens the escalation. The resolution is inevitable rather than earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the "psychic hailstorm" is stated but not dramatized in the scene. The external pressure of Elara's arrival dissipates immediately upon observation, resolving the conflict without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and personal (erasure vs. memory), and the pressure escalates naturally with the patrolman's arrival. The conflict resolves through a meaningful exchange of information and emotion rather than coincidence, though the antagonist's capitulation is slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high in concept (loss of history) but low in dramatic tension; the conflict manifests as a mechanical struggle (tuning dials) rather than a personal cost. The escalation relies on external timers (fading light) rather than protagonist agency forcing a difficult trade-off, resulting in procedural rather than dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is excellent for the length; each failure causally narrows Elara's options and raises the stakes from indirect interference to personal confrontation. The cost of failure is palpably felt throughout the progression.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure escalates effectively through the arrival of the carriers, but the protagonist faces no active trade-offs or rising costs. The resolution comes from an external atmospheric shift rather than Elara’s agency, resulting in low dramatic tension despite the high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the stakes are clear, the on-page pressure is relatively low; the solution comes from a moment of sudden insight rather than a struggle with escalating costs in the present moment. The "failure" is historical, reducing the immediate tension of the lock-picking beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative lacks active opposition or genuine escalation; Elian solves a puzzle and walks through a door without facing a reversal or making a difficult trade-off. The stakes remain abstract, and the resolution comes without a felt price—he simply gains a new, better purpose without losing anything of value.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.2)
    Narrative pressure is negligible; the wind arrives on cue and the sculpture functions perfectly, leaving the "dominant stake" (preserving wonder) theoretically declared but practically untested. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and thus no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is present, moving from internal static to physical danger. The antagonist is somewhat abstract ("formless chaos"), which distances the conflict slightly, but the physical toll on the narrator ("processors scream") and the trade-off of safety for freedom provide sufficient weight to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is absent; Elias faces no obstacles, and the threat of the drill remains abstract and exerts no visceral pressure in the scene. The protagonist pays no price—time, reputation, or emotional labor—to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is clear—logic vs. chance—but the opposition yields quickly to the solution. The climax lacks a moment of high risk where the cost of "surrendering the variable" is viscerally felt rather than just intellectually accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is purely environmental (pushing against "thick air"). There is no moment where Silas must trade one value for another or risk permanent loss; the opposition is a physical hurdle rather than a true complication. The victory comes too easily, flattening the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "prophecy" functions as ambient background noise rather than an active opposition. The ritual proceeds without a single snag or escalation—explicitly noted when "The wing did not tremble or burn"—resulting in a flatline tension curve where the protagonist faces no risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is low; the "interrogation" meets no resistance, as Elias yields the truth immediately upon being asked. The "agreed upon lies" imply a tension that never manifests in the scene, resulting in a climax without visible risk or cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established (isolation vs. painful truth), and the memory's shift from joy to "consuming fire" provides effective escalation. The final choice to "push harder" demonstrates agency and willingness to pay an emotional price, though the internal conflict is resolved somewhat quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (war vs. peace), but the on-page conflict is static (Man vs. Object). The pressure comes from the precision of the task rather than active opposition or evolving complications, limiting the escalation to a single note of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of opposition; the protagonist walks from point A to point B without encountering obstacles or paying a price. The "conflict" is purely a puzzle to be solved, with no escalation of risk or forcing of a trade-off that would define agency.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is severely under-pressured; the antagonist offers no effective resistance and evaporates immediately upon being challenged. The protagonist faces no genuine jeopardy or risk of failure, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are purely internal and aesthetic, resulting in low narrative pressure. While the desire to connect is clear, the cost of the action (whistling) is minimal—framed only as "foolishness"—which limits the intensity of the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are high for the world but low for the protagonist, who treats the anomaly as an intellectual puzzle without facing active opposition or personal risk. The lack of a felt, on-page cost or a moment of genuine doubt limits the escalation; the victory feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    External stakes are high, but the resolution lacks a felt cost. The conflict is resolved by finding a "third way" map that bypasses the difficult choice between the two shadow factions, rather than forcing Elian to sacrifice something to forge that path. The tension dissipates too easily when the sun breaks through immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are purely thematic and aesthetic; while the goal is clear, there is no meaningful opposition or pressure that forces a hard choice. The "tightening" is procedural (collecting sounds) rather than dramatic, lacking a felt cost or risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation is coherent, moving from a "discordant hum" to structural threats that force a change in tactics. The stakes are clear, though the resolution comes relatively smoothly once the method is employed.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are high in theory but low in practice, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma during the scene. The escalation is a ticking clock without an antagonist or obstacle to force a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tension between Fletcher's demand for simplicity and Elias's need for truth provides a clear, escalating stake. The cost is subtle but felt—a "quiet refusal" that marks a risky professional departure and a personal claiming of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the backstory stakes (suicide) are high, the on-page conflict is low-voltage; Arthur accepts Elias's reframing immediately without resistance. The scene lacks a "tightening" beat where the opposing viewpoints clash before the resolution, reducing the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and binary: success or death in the acid. The escalation is logical, moving from intellectual frustration to physical peril. The cost is the tangible risk of life, paid on the page by the jump, ensuring the climax feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are legible, but the antagonist (Kael) provides only token resistance, accepting Elara’s lie immediately and disappearing. This lack of genuine pressure or complication in the central conflict beat flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension remains flat as the protagonist faces no obstacles or escalation; the accusation is introduced and immediately solved by looking in the mirror. There is no moment where options narrow or the protagonist must trade one value for another, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.6)
    External pressure is minimal as other volunteers give Elara a "wide berth," removing potential social friction. The internal conflict—the "fold in patience"—is described in interiority rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice or near-failure on the page. The stakes remain somewhat abstract, and the resolution comes without a visible cost paid during the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is low-voltage and purely internal; the epiphany feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through resistance. The protagonist arrives at peace through observation, lacking a sharp moment of risk or a visible cost beyond the surrender of a grudge.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative lacks significant escalating pressure; Kael is highly competent and overcomes obstacles (the crowd, the machine) with relative ease. The climax relies on procedural success rather than a hard trade-off or high-stakes risk, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or escalation; Elias faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The narrative flatlines emotionally because the outcome is pre-ordained and the stakes ("collective healing") are abstract and resolved by magic rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear but largely intellectual; the conflict is internal (order vs. chaos). The escalation is somewhat flattened by the summary of his decoding process ("He began to perceive connections"), reducing the felt pressure. The final choice is a valid renunciation, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tension is well-managed; the racing clock of the fading memory creates genuine urgency against the slow, atmospheric backdrop. The stakes are internal but high, and the climax forces a meaningful trade-off: losing the specific tool (the sigil) to gain the raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure is immediate and escalates cleanly through sensory intensity (sound, vibration, cracking glass). The stakes are dual-layered (survival vs. memory), and the climax forces a meaningful trade-off: saving the station requires freezing time and sacrificing the lens. The cost is palpable and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is ostensibly present in the estrangement, but it evaporates instantly upon contact with Elara’s "firm, compassionate truth." Because the primary obstacle (Lena's resistance) is resolved in a single summary sentence without dramatized struggle or trade-off, the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral. There is no moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is minimal throughout; the conflict is purely intellectual (scholar vs. puzzle) with no time constraint, antagonist, or external threat to drive escalation. The protagonist simply proceeds through her task to success, resulting in a low-tension arc where failure never feels like a credible danger.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the preservation of a rational worldview versus the undeniable physical proof of the supernatural. The escalation is sharp, driven by the tactile reality of the tooth which forces a "compound fracture" of his beliefs. The cost is felt—a permanent cleft in his certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain low and abstract throughout; the antagonist is the passive mist, and the "fire" is a memory rather than an immediate threat. The escalation is purely textural (the glass getting cleaner), and the protagonist faces no significant trade-offs or risks of failure. The ending brings success without a visible or felt cost, limiting the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are intimate and clear, focusing on Kaelen’s psychological paralysis. While external pressure is low, the "patient metronome" of the melting ice provides a subtle, effective escalation that forces the protagonist to break the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract and metaphorical (artistic integrity vs. emptiness), limiting visceral impact. The external pressure (the current) perfectly mirrors the internal state, creating a cohesive but predictable escalation without external variables.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the only obstacle is a "slight tremor" and a "faint dissonance" fixed instantly without cost. There is no antagonist, no scarcity, and no moment where the outcome is genuinely at risk. The stakes ("listless village") are abstract and off-page, lowering the immediate tension to zero.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes (a child's safety) are high, and the pressure of the "global fear" provides a solid backdrop, but the on-page conflict is largely static (man vs. cold/patience). The escalation is procedural—step-by-step success—rather than a tightening of options or a confrontation with failure. The narrative lacks a sharp turn or deepening complication that forces a trade-off beyond the established cost of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are abstract; the "wounded season" provides atmospheric pressure but never directly jeopardizes Elian's work in the cavern. The escalation is linear (time passing) rather than causal or intensifying, and success feels inevitable from the start due to the protagonist's unchecked competence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist possesses total competence, and the "keen" grief is processed immediately without threatening failure or demanding a new tactic. The stakes remain abstract ("formless sorrows") rather than visceral for the weaver himself. There is no escalation of difficulty, only the successful execution of an established task.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal pressure scales well with the rising sound of the kettle, creating a coherent escalation of focus. While the stakes are purely internal, the cost of "parcelling" grief is felt, though the epiphany arrives a bit too neatly without enough resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict is legible, but the resolution lacks sufficient resistance. The ghost's immediate agreement ("The ghost did not argue") deflates the tension at the climax; a more prolonged struggle or a refusal that forced Kael to carry the burden alone would have heightened the emotional cost. The escalation relies on a single memory trigger rather than a mounting series of pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is largely mechanical; Elara faces a puzzle, finds the pieces immediately, and solves it without setbacks or significant cost. The pressure remains low throughout, as the success feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is low; the protagonist executes a pre-decided plan without facing new obstacles. The climax relies on environmental coincidence (the sunbeam) to trigger the internal release, weakening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "quiet deadline" of the radio creates functional pressure, though the consequences of failure remain abstract. The physical escalation of the salvage is handled well, providing a concrete obstacle to the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    Narrative tension is minimal; the external pressure (fog) and the obstacle (the knot) are met with pre-established competence rather than struggle. The climax relies on an internal realization ("Understanding bloomed") that resolves the issue smoothly without visible sacrifice, trade-offs, or heightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal barrier, or escalating pressure opposing Kaelen’s goal. The stakes are purely theoretical (understanding), and the resolution comes without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—organic beauty vs. mechanical dominance—is clear, but the conflict is largely internal and managed through montage. There is little active opposition or immediate external pressure in the scene to force difficult trade-offs. The climax works conceptually, but the lack of a specific, time-bound threat lowers the visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are personal and symbolic, and the sacrifice of the father's coin creates a legible cost. The tension is somewhat dampened by the elision of the fire fight itself, moving the conflict entirely to the post-disaster repair phase.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the migrating geese serve as a passive timer rather than an active threat or obstacle. The protagonist faces no genuine opposition or dilemma that forces a narrowing of options; the sequence is a successful execution of a plan without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stake—breaking a cycle of consumptive renewal—is established early and felt throughout. The conflict is primarily internal and thematic, resolved by a shift in perspective rather than external conquest. The cost is the abandonment of the "safe" method of mapping for the vulnerable act of broadcasting.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is largely internal and abstract, lacking a concrete antagonist or obstacle beyond "not knowing." The resolution is an epiphany that arrives without a visible cost, trade-off, or foreclosed option, leaving the stakes feeling low.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract ("town's spiritual alignment") and strictly internal; while the pendulum creates time pressure, no obstacle forces the protagonist to alter his tactics or pay a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition on the page; Elias faces no external antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure. The process of discovery is linear and frictionless—he looks, he finds, he solves—resulting in zero escalation. The stakes are purely intellectual and resolve instantly upon the physical action of pulling the thread.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high on a conceptual level (survival of the species), but the immediate scene lacks urgent pressure or an antagonist. The conflict is entirely internal—the weight of the decision—which creates a "throat-clearing" effect where the story ends exactly when the action begins.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the global stakes (cultural erasure) are high, the immediate scene stakes are low because Elias encounters no obstacles; the radio works perfectly, the ink flows smoothly, and no external threat intrudes. The internal tension is stated ("clenching fear") rather than dramatized through a close call or a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is muted; the client accepts Elara's guidance without resistance, leaving the stakes purely internal and theoretical. The rocking chair adds a mechanical constraint (time), but the emotional pressure feels static because the outcome is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—validating his worldview against the "Sun-Kissed"—is clear and escalates well through the girl's rejection of the cog. The cost is felt in his "brittle and humorless" laugh and final isolation, satisfying the requirement for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is largely theoretical or summarized (&quot;ghosts of old arguments&quot;) rather than dramatized through active resistance in the scene. The choir yields immediately to the new method, deflating the tension and making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are high conceptually (history of a people) but low in the moment; the conflict is resolved through a straightforward process without setbacks. The "cost" of erasing history is glossed over rather than dramatized as a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the inspector offers no pushback to Silas’s crypticism, and the transaction is smooth rather than fraught. The stakes remain abstract and thematic (“the city’s soul”) without immediate, felt consequences for the characters on the page. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and low throughout. The "white cube" acts as a passive straw man rather than an active opposition, and Elara faces no risk of discovery or failure. The resolution comes too easily, missing the tightening of pressure or forced trade-off required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established (destruction of the city vs. moral integrity) and escalate sharply upon the realization of the city's living nature. The pressure is coherent, and the renunciation forecloses the path of "righteousness" with a felt emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but palpable; the cost of success is the "fresh wound" of regret, which is visibly felt. The pressure escalates cleanly through the preparation and the roll, forcing a trade-off between painless non-existence and painful meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain low and internal; the protagonist risks only the feeling of foolishness. The resolution arrives without a tangible trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in a victory that feels unearned by the pressure applied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes (survival of the city) are high, the pressure on the protagonist dissolves too easily. The elders' opposition ("weary resignation") crumbles immediately upon his return, and the physical threat of the ice yields to the first attempt at singing. The absence of a visible or felt cost—sacrifice, failure, or trade-off—lowers the narrative tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (existence vs. erasure) is high, but the on-page conflict is low-friction; Elias faces no external resistance or internal hesitation during the assembly. The tension relies entirely on the magnitude of the outcome rather than a struggle to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (oblivion/capture) and escalate naturally as the narrator descends deeper. The conflict with Fear is metaphorical but grounded by the mirror imagery. The resolution involves a felt cost—the acceptance of one's own "cold nothingness" as permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival of the sanctuary), but the escalation is purely external (the storm gets stronger, Kai handles it). The protagonist never loses control or faces a moment where his method fails, resulting in a predictable victory lap rather than a tension-filled struggle with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal intellectual challenge to an existential threat for the entire civilization. The pressure is coherent, driven by the "silent pressure" of the sun and the watchers. The cost is felt in the destruction of the mother's whistle and the burden of the terrible truth.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the intellectual stakes (truth vs. stability) are clear, the dramatic conflict is flat because the antagonist yields without a fight. The scene lacks an escalation phase where Aris’s goal is genuinely imperiled by Elara’s opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes (loss of the heirloom/memory) are established early, but the escalation is brief. The climax (the dive) is resolved in a few sentences ("scrabbled," "brushed," "broke surface"), lacking the meaningful deepening or "cadence shift" required for higher impact. The obstacle is overcome too conveniently to generate sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the integrity of history versus a convenient lie, escalating quietly but significantly through the discovery of the stamp. The pressure is coherent under the causal lens, leading to a meaningful deepening of the protagonist's worldview, though the external opposition is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are clear and personal, centering on the struggle to master grief. The pressure is maintained through the physical difficulty of the ascent and the "strange physics." However, the climax resolves somewhat smoothly; the vision triggers an epiphany without Kaelen having to make a difficult trade-off or overcome a final spike of resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The external pressure of the stabilizing coolant creates a functional ticking clock that forces the protagonist to act. The escalation relies heavily on internal processing and typing rather than difficult active choices, but the cost—reliving the trauma to fuel the machine—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal and purely physical ("immense weight of the corroded mechanism"), resolved immediately without complication or adaptation. The stakes ("frequency of belonging") remain abstract concepts that are never tested or risked in the scene. There is no meaningful escalation; the path from start to finish is a straight line.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes escalate effectively from a personal search for closure to a battle against existential erasure. The cost is palpable; Elias must embrace the aspect of his nature he loathes to achieve his goal, creating a satisfying internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the on-page pressure is static tension rather than escalating conflict; the exchange proceeds without a distinct obstacle or unforeseen cost that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear and the internal pressure builds coherently to the final choice. However, the conflict is articulated through melodramatic summary ("backlash of regrets hit him with the force of a physical wave") rather than escalating through concrete, on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are clear but pressure is low; the physical journey is a straightforward walk, and the internal conflict is resolved primarily by reading an explanatory letter. The struggle is largely off-page or summarized, reducing the impact of the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are visceral and high, pitting human identity against spiritual longing with a tangible physical cost. The escalation is managed well through the accelerating transformation and the protagonist's brief but intense struggle against it. The cost—losing his human form—is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are high internally, but the external pressure is static; Elara is alone with her thoughts, and the conflict is resolved by simply changing her mind. There is no meaningful tightening of options or external obstacle that forces the "cloudbound repentance" to become a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is present and coherent, moving from general grief to personal trauma with increasing physical weight. However, the resolution via "acceptance" feels slightly low-resistance dramatically; the protagonist welcomes the pain and transcends it without a moment of doubt or failure that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no opposition, internal resistance, or risk of failure. Kael intends to release the fireflies, does so without obstacle, and receives cosmic validation, resulting in a narrative flatline regarding stakes and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is present but low-voltage. The external pressure comes from a "nervous patrol" that is bypassed with a simple feint, lacking genuine escalation or a moment where the plan is at risk of failure. The stakes are high in theory (treason/revolution) but low in the dramatized moment, as the opposition is passive and easily outmaneuvered.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high and clearly communicated, with the aurora acting as an effective ticking clock. The escalation is solid, though the cost of the "last resort" feels somewhat abstract since the star dust was introduced solely to be expended, lacking a deeper sense of personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist faces no active resistance or dilemma; he simply waits for a timer and then executes a scheduled action. The absence of a struggle to maintain the vigil or a hesitation to open the envelope flattens the dramatic tension, leaving the stakes largely abstract until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain purely intellectual; there is no sense of danger, risk of failure, or personal cost to Kaelen. The escalation relies on the movement of the shadow (time pressure), but Kaelen’s calm mastery drains the tension, resulting in a sequence of executed maneuvers rather than a conflict with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes (safety vs. connection) are established but not rigorously tested. The "threat" of the drifters is dismissed instantly by Silas's perception and their immediate benevolence, resulting in a conflict curve that flatlines right at the moment of potential escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is external (collapsing reality) rather than immediate or antagonistic; the execution of the plan proceeds without error or active resistance, flattening tension during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    The monsoon creates effective time pressure (ticking clock). The central conflict between empirical logic and whimsical reality is established early, though the protagonist overcomes the obstacle relatively easily via intuition, missing a chance for higher causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("color of unspoken apologies") and the conflict lacks genuine pressure; Kenji encounters no obstacles, opposition, or difficult choices on his way to the bluff. The climax is a passive experience where he stands still and lets a magical object alter his emotional state, resulting in a resolution devoid of agency or sacrifice. The "tides" are mentioned but do not force a change in tactics.

    Dominant stake (navigate sorrow) signaled early, deepens via agency in holding compass at peak, foreclosing drowning grief with felt price in "memories did not vanish"; lens escalation via cadence shift to "gentle, rhythmic swell."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep observing life or rejoin it—tightens when the dust-lens reveals life-death transfer. Escalation is textural: each return visit adds grime-sightings that deepen the moral cost of detachment. Agency crystallizes in the wipe; options narrow to shovel or perpetual exile. Price is visible (grief acknowledged), but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform witness-survivor into purposeful decipherer—tightens once when frost–ledger correspondence is discovered, foreclosing passive exile. Escalation is textural: each dawn’s ice pattern collapses possibilities until only the hidden canyon remains. Cost is felt: she risks re-traumatizing fire by relighting kiln to seal the evidence. Agency remains hers; no coincidental rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—render silence into visible music—tightens when trauma’s orange/indigo threatens to drown the cereus violet. Escalation is her decision to fuse rather than banish trauma, visible in the color shift on glass. Cost is legible: the bloom opens once, exhausts her, and the old roar is transmuted not erased. Could be sharper if the circlet’s energy drain was physical (trembling hands, nosebleed) but the emotional price still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silence versus endless static—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with each body-count of tablets filled. Pressure escalates through physical (crushing depth) and psychic (cascading voices) vectors; the lens insertion is the irreversible turn that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: he strands himself in a drowned city to man a librarian’s desk for ghosts. One beat short of perfect escalation—no credible loss of tool/stamina on the descent—but the silence he earns is priced high enough.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single dominant stake—locate the fate of unused love—signaled early. Escalation is textural: breath cycle sharpens/dissolves the image, a gentle deepening rather than option-narrowing. No price is visibly paid (no failed attempt, no forfeiture); cost is purely contemplative. Agency is observational; the “healing” is realization, not decision, limiting band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—salvage identity from temporal erosion—tightens with each leaf-fade until only obliteration remains. Escalation is causal and irreversible: first memory ghosts, then wife’s face blurs, finally entire autobiography torrents out as raw chronology; price paid is total self-loss. Agency persists to the last surging alignment of hedges, so protagonist drives his own annihilation. Slight reserve: external pressure is abstract (the artifact), not another will, so tension is monoscopic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—protect the clandestine seed vault—tightens once when the arrow’s cipher transforms inert keys into a live defense system, foreclosing the option of direct escape. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: each inserted key narrows enforcer access while raising the visible cost of her own immobility. The price (she stays shackled while the city falls) is felt on-page and shapes the final image. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the mechanical chaos is authored by her decoded sequence, satisfying causal-lens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the exact frequency of trust breaking—signals in paragraph two and tightens when the forge starts compressing; failure = eternal rehearsal of betrayal. Escalation via density: each absence poured increases the internal pressure on the quartz until the violet-grey glare erupts. Visible price: the aurora’s ache becomes his toothache—external hazard mirrors internal cost. Agency maintained: he initiates every compression; no coincidence resolves the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—control over illuminated moments—shifts from past (portraits) to future (moonbeams) and tightens once: the floral code forces an unplanned job that risks exposure. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits his identity as thief and accepts perpetual ontological uncertainty (“he did not know if he could ever believe his eyes again”). Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. A second tightening would be needed for 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—finish one lens vs. survive collapse—tightens once when STRUCTURAL FAILURE light flicks; abandonment forecloses art path with visible cost (sphere melts). Thaw as external pressure complicates but does not escalate through protagonist agency; price is legible but not persistent—no constraint shapes later steps once she flees.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—erasure vs self-proof—signals early and escalates through each shell-whisper and cipher line. The midpoint decryption of the cast is the meaningful tightening: it converts nostalgic pain into tactical agency and flips the escape route into a trap. Cost is legible in the final image—Julian’s terror and the protagonist’s trembling certainty—options have narrowed to a single red-flashing pier. Pressure stays causal under the Hero’s adaptive drive; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens exactly once: the star’s disappearance collapses possibility into necessity, forcing the final glyph. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is atmospheric yet felt; options narrow from “chart darkness” to “accept sole stewardship.” No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into honesty—tightens when Elias realizes the doodles are grief, not accusation; this narrows his options to either keep collecting or step forward. One visible cost: he forfeits his ritualized safety (leaves the desk) and Lena forfeits the privacy of her cipher. Escalation is an accumulative deepening, not causal reversals; the cenotaph beat is the decisive intensifier. Agency remains with Elias’s decision to spy-then-reveal, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single stake—save job by proving gardens > algorithms—tightens at the commemoration ritual, then again when the manager’s tablet declares a tie. Cost is legible: Elias risks livelihood, then deliberately mars his one “perfect” marble, trading sterile purity for lived truth.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—linear vs. sideways time—signaled in Aris’s obsession and Elias’s steady compliance. Tightening occurs at lever-pull: options collapse from one possible present to an undeniable plurality; cost is the vertigo that “settles” in Elias’s soul. Agency is Elias’s hand on the lever; no external antagonist needed. Pressure coherent under causal lens; coincidence absent. No visible material loss, but the conceptual price (loss of singular self) is felt on-page and reweights the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode ghost—tightens exactly once when passive reading fails and he risks destroying the text; that single escalation forecloses preservation and forces the coda. Cost is visible: the program dissolves, its linen body lost forever. No reversals needed; the deepening is the irreversible act. Pressure stays situational but coherent under the hush.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
    <comment>Theme of transmission versus erotic destruction emerges implicitly: art needs ruin to speak. Subtext in the water’s “greed” and the ghost’s exhalation reframes decay as collaboration. No moral spoken; final “distant, living symphony” reweights the prior silence. Line about “wordless conversation” is the lone thematic echo, but it lands early enough to avoid sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—need to know Liam’s fate—tightens once: smudge → ambiguity → renunciation. Escalation is textural, not causal: each sensory detail increases emotional density until the illustration flip supplies the single deepening. Cost is legible—she forfeits certainty forever. Could wish for one earlier micro-choice that foreshadows the final renunciation, but the pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding the measure of his guilt—tightens when the factory ghosts accuse; agency narrows to "solve" or be consumed. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the valve demands physical intervention that fuses external haunting with internal failure. Cost is visceral: metal groan, ragged breathing, permanent weight accepted. Coincidence (radio callers) complicates rather than resolves, keeping pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Lena re-frame the curl or stay frozen—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: eclipse totality forces the hand-to-earth beat; no outside rescue. Agency is Lena’s micro-choice to release the desperate grip; price is the sob and later the shaky smile. Escalation is accumulative: music density increases, sky darkens, corona ignites new meaning. Cost is legible in the changed grip and raspy admission, “It was so beautiful.”

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—“why did imagination die?”—are signaled early and tighten through each diary fragment; every new line thins the dream further. Agency is curatorial rather than heroic: each gentle turn of a page forecloses the possibility that any other witness will ever act. Cost is conceptual but legible: the act of archiving is also an act of surrender to eternal silence. One meaningful deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens; no reversals required.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: dragons → tapestry → burned page → bronze quiet. The final tableau reconfigures myth itself as extinct resource; no character moralizes. Subtextual brilliance: the same wall that preserves sound also guarantees no new sound will ever be made. The reader leaves with the hollowing, not a lesson—an emotional aftereffect that reverberates beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: maintain harmony by covert direction; tightening occurs when fogged exchange becomes irreversible once cars vanish. Agency is Elias’s orchestration; cost is relinquishing his post and identity. No coincidence resolves—luck only complicates visibility. Price (abandoned typewriter) visible on page; would like one earlier tactical loss to edge higher.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save Elara before the possession completes—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each stacked loop. The entity’s axiom is the antagonist; each rhetorical question narrows its logical options until the glitch forces a stance collapse. Price is paid in Elara’s gasp and the drained silence afterward. Agency is cerebral but active: Alistair’s verbal probes, not luck, unravel the stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—compose the life-symphony before exhaustion—signaled early and tightens via the ticking orbital window. The memory-mapping beats successively foreclose alternate nights; the dawn alignment delivers the last viable moment. Cost is cumulative fatigue visible in tremoring hand. Could edge higher if one intermediate tactical loss (dropped pen, smeared ink) had altered trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escape the loop by locating its seed—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes retracing must go backward through the algorithm, not across the bridge. Agency is internal: surrender to memory; this narrows options from endless flight to one coordinate. Cost is the永久 loss of weightlessness, a felt forfeiture. Escalation is single but sufficient: frantic shifting slows to stillness as he accepts the drop.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens once: the inverted groove moves from private obsession to shared, tear-streaked relief. Cost is visible: man weeps, woman smiles, Elara’s hand on the spent stylus. Agency is attention/renunciation—she releases the arm, lets silence finish the work.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting intellectual integrity against surveillance—surges when pigeon data implies the watchers can falsify his sacred weather records. Lateral-entry decision narrows his option field from open confrontation to clandestine mapping; price is surrender of daylight legitimacy. Escalation stays atmospheric rather than violent, fitting the situational lens. One minor slack: physical danger feels abstract, muting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: will he survive the scent memory or be hollowed by it? Pressure tightens when UV lamp converts curiosity into live confrontation with bloom-time limit. Agency: he chooses to place vial under UV, chooses to breathe in—each act narrows escape routes. Cost legible: once Somniflora opens, grief can no longer be dodged; the flower’s death parallels irrevocable acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—singular mind vs cosmic unity—tightens once when the Lumin enters and again when Elias reframes the choice. Escalation is conceptual: each revelation about the pattern narrows his options until refusal becomes the only agency-preserving act. Cost is legible: he forfeits both immortality and curated forgetfulness, accepting perpetual tension. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished song”—tightens when each note risks violating the hush; escalation is the increasing harmonic response from dome and hull that reweights silence from void to resonant partner. Visible price: muscle ache, the absorbed note never returning, the droplet as single earned payoff. No false reversals; coincidence merely complicates absorption physics.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can love’s high exist without its crash?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each static layer (laughter-pop, suspicion-drag) thickens density until the final tightening—decanting severs joy from sorrow, narrowing options to an either/or with visible price. Agency is continuous: Kael decides to absorb the full emotion, then decides to bottle half. Cost accumulates inside his chest—“cold, dense stone”—altering later tactics (he will carry residue forever).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: honoring invisible labor. Pressure escalates once, sharply, when Elias reveals the endowed chair; the grant both narrows his own anonymity and widens David’s legacy, visible cost measured in Alina’s tremor and tears. No artificial antagonist needed—social invisibility supplies coherent pressure. The tightening is meaningful and sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—belonging—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when he drops the reed-bird to join the search. The vine-tag discovery reframes communal identity, forcing his tactical shift from spectacle to service. Cost is visible: overnight labor, public exposure, and the quiet forfeiture of outsider status. Pressure escalates once; no off-stage resolutions; coincidence complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is declared early: keep the giant napping by preserving cadence; each temporal distortion tightens that need. Middle beat—Elias realizes he must “use its own method”—narrows options from fight to mimicry, visible trade-off. Cost is civic: collapse avoided, but none is extracted from Elias personally; tension scales to the city, not the man, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—quantify grief or remain haunted by its formlessness—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each stone-chip “vector.” The single meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice reveals that absence and presence interlock; this forecloses the fantasy of erasing loss and reweights the stake to living alongside it. Cost is visible: the hum rises, the eyes cool, and the conjurer’s optimism must sprout in soil that still contains the void. No reversals are needed; the pressure is cumulative and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Anya’s irretrievable loss—tightens when Elias realizes the outage erased the oral-history server; the fragment becomes the last living trace. One meaningful deepening: his routine retrieval turns into a deliberate exposure gamble, narrowing his safe options to zero if mis-timed. Cost is on-page: each footstep toward the reading table increases the risk of being caught and losing his entire invisible life. Escalation is accumulative under lens, not multi-reversal, exactly fitting short-form allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve identity vs. allow metamorphosis—tightens when the leaf reveals surrender as survival. Single meaningful turn: pick up saw instead of hammer; option foreclosed, cost legible. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from ruin—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the brooch offers literal fossilized meaning. The single reversal (give it away) narrows options: he can’t sell it, can’t paint it as still-life, must internalize its story. Cost is immediate—he forfeits the island’s most tradeable relic—and future-blind: the painting he starts may fail. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence (her arrival) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“guard or release the Heartstone”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the music stutters. Mid-story deepening occurs when her scrying fails; the option of denial is foreclosed in the shadow-merge beat. Cost is legible: permanent loss of foresight. One micro-turn suffices for this length; escalation is textural (cave’s song growing stranger) rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore communal narrative from detritus—tightens when the valve’s arrival offers a test: will meaning take root outside Kaelen? The woman’s recognition provides the single, meaningful deepening; her straightened shoulders externalize cost and foreclose despair. Agency remains accumulative—curation as quiet resistance—consistent with lens. No false cliffhangers; escalation is a cadence shift from solitary salvage to communal echo.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—find mentor—tightens when cracks funnel Elias to the brick wall lock; punch-drill is the irreversible trade-off. Cost is conceptual: once inside, he can’t return unchanged; mentor’s constellation confirms the price. Agency drives every beat; no coincidences. Escalation stays causal but could be sharper if earlier cracks hinted at energy tariff.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honor grandmother vs. protect empirical self—tightens when the whale sequence during the squall offers a single irreversible path: transcribe or betray her. One meaningful deepening suffices; the storm’s acoustics crystallize the pattern, forcing agency. Cost is the permanent loss of his prior epistemic safety, legible in the silence that follows the final etch.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the rift becomes the sole option. Escalation is causal: each magnetic twist narrows possibility until the rift negates “somewhere.” Felt price is the amulet’s silence and the not-knowing thrill; cost is legible. Slight deduction because the storm-clock (solar tantrum) is more ambience than ticking constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“one life for one livelihood destroyed”—tightens when the only path is to counterfeit death itself. Escalation is one-way: each preparatory step (makeup, chilling, paperwork) forecloses retreat and raises exposure. The visible price is her lifetime of honesty; the felt price is the dissolving ink that erases her own moral ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can a composite memory substitute for an erased life—tightens as each layer adds sensory density and risks dissolution at the horn blast. Agency is the deliberate layering act that forecloses official identity; cost is the knowledge that the memory will dissipate. Escalation is textural: violet grief + gold wonder + poison label = phantom history that collapses. Under accumulative lens, the deepening reweights the stake; visible price is the empty container and the retreating tide.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode Thorne’s riddle—tightens through each failed hum until the tone locks in, foreclosing further shortcuts. Pressure is causal and accumulative: every micro-adjustment of bow tension narrows the next option. The visible price is the observatory’s ozone-thick air and Elias’s trembling arm, but the cost is more metaphysical than material. Sufficient tightening for this length, though not searingly painful.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve Revel’s autonomy—signalled in paragraph 3. Escalation: impending privatization → graffiti counter-order → inspector’s disorientation; each step narrows options and raises visibility risk. Agency is cerebral (designing the graffiti code) yet effective; cost is the permanent need for secrecy. One decisive tightening at the inspector walk-through satisfies length-appropriate pressure. No causal or lens break.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the last bloom—tightens as cold, darkness, and sunrise form a live countdown; every minute costs battery heat and suit integrity. The chemical lure is one visible price (irreplaceable heirloom destroyed), the photograph another (memory burden he’ll carry). Agency is continuous: kneel, sprinkle, shoot, endure. One meaningful deepening: sunrise arrives as blade, foreclosing all further options—extinction achieved, witness sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—the ship sails blind without this drone—rings from first line to last. Escalation is purely textural: each horn blast layers density, thinning available time while sensory detail sharpens. Agency is crystallized in the patch moment; no outside savior appears. Cost is felt in the final stillness, but because the price is opportunity/ exhaustion rather than a visible forfeiture, it just misses the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—witness the convergence—tightens once: failure means his mentor’s life’s work stays myth. The frost-map arrival forecloses every alternative method (radar, satellites) and costs his professional identity. Agency is attention and endurance; the price is the irrelevance of every map he ever edited. Escalation is causal, single but decisive.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge systems collapse into lived, ephemeral image. The rivers’ “heart on glass” reweights obsession into transience; cartography becomes performance art. No moral delivered—only the crystallized irony that the world reveals itself when paper fails. Subtext resides in silence: Lyra’s circling flight is the only commentary the planet offers.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—“restore shared balance”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through sonic density: from single boots to murmuring crowd of echoes. The shimmer of the baker is the visible price of success, proving the stakes are material, not abstract. No reversal is needed; the deepening is the accumulation itself. The final commitment to perpetual return crystallizes the cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bottle silence or die empty-handed—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens twice: oxygen alarm strobe, then total power loss. Each escalation is driven by protagonist agency (activate matrix, uncork, seal) under Accumulative/Textural lens; the psychic maelstrom intensifies density until the single crystalline note is isolated. Cost is legible on the page: breath grows ragged, distress signal dies, and the vial’s glow is purchased with extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he verify an impossible truth at the cost of perpetual disbelief—tightens once: sealed door vs. personal legacy. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (salt, rust, hush) deepens the price of looking. The hovering tableau is the visible cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: will Elian receive the alchemical legacy without lethal cost? Escalation via intensifying toxicity and lengthening cameos; persistence of poisoned flowers forces him to keep working despite danger. Agency is endurance/attention rather than decisive act—valid under Accumulative lens. Cost visible on skin burns and in Lyra’s dissolution; options reweighted: he inherits knowledge but loses guardian and must shoulder risk alone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is voiced on page 2: “beauty coaxed from even the most profound desolation.” Escalation is accumulative—each night of unconscious stitching adds density until the lattice becomes vulnerable to erasure; the storm threatens to flay the art from stone, tightening options to one: bleed and knot or lose everything. Cost is legible in torn palms and kelp-rope soaked with blood; the wind’s post-storm music is the audible proof the price held. Agency is endurance/renunciation—he refuses to let the dream be erased, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore faith in lineage—tightens when displaced sundial appears; freeing it becomes the single meaningful escalation. No external antagonist; pressure is orchard’s entanglement forcing slower tactics. Cost is paid in sweat, cracked fingernails, and the irreversible act of sealing the carving into place. Coincidence (finding disc) complicates but does not resolve; final meaning is her active reinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver a false identity without digital trace—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each analog act (chalk, envelope, stamp) deepens the commitment to opacity; no reversal, but options narrow. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the irreversible hand-off to surface mail surrenders control. Agency is present—every step is Kaelen’s active fabrication—but because no live counter-pressure appears, the tension plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—exposure of the coup versus preservation of her cover—tightens the instant the calibration window is announced; the 3-minute uplink is an on-page ticking clock that forces the final risk. Agency is pure: she alone converts cloth into cipher and queues the burst. Cost is visible in the resumed, slower stitching—she has now weaponized her life’s work and can never feign harmless again.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Kael face the instant he chose fear over love? Pressure escalates once: spirits’ murmur → hymn → keening as text appears, forcing recognition. No reversals needed; the single deepening is enough. Cost is Elara’s spent energy and Kael’s irrevocable sight of his own cowardice—options narrow to live with the truth, no fix offered.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can translation open a human breach in the bunker of Varin’s heart—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient: each deciphered childhood fear tightens the screw until Varin must either harden further or acknowledge shared vulnerability. Agency rests with Elias’s decision to keep decoding; the price is strategic surprise traded for paternal recognition. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim lost joy”—faces one visible tightening: over-exposure will white-out memory forever, a tactical risk taken when fragment meets beam. Cost is legible: the mural lasts only seconds before fog reclaims it, leaving him with after-image rather than possession. Agency sits entirely with Elian; no external antagonist needed. Could use one more intermediate beat where he actively rejects an easier, dimmer projection—would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled in first paragraph and deepened with each refracted garden. Each bounce narrows options by dissolving the previous reality, forcing new orientation. The seven-tone convergence is the decisive tightening that forecloses escape and crystallizes the mirrored stance. Cost is visible: the flawless nickel erases the prior carvings, leaving only his wide eye.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving untaxed thought—announced early and sharpened when readers learn roots are being decoded. Escalation is a single, decisive tightening: passive resistance → active cognitive sabotage with city-wide fallout. Legible cost in the sirens’ sudden silence and Aris’s fearful protests. Could use one intermediate obstacle beat to earn the jump to mass-mind disruption, but pressure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transform endless insomnia into bearable creation—tightens when pain texture “shifts like sand grinding into a pearl,” a single decisive intensification. Agency remains hers: she elects to hold the ache until it blooms, then embeds the postcard, foreclosing escape. No reversal, but accrual pattern legibly pivots from sorrow to reef-shadow joy. Cost is the eternal sleeplessness she ratifies, visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single stake: archive Simple Trust before its last ember dies. Escalation is the tightening silence as Elian climbs toward the unlit orchid; the cracked tube’s inevitable broken note embodies the irreversible narrowing. Cost is felt—he tastes the toxin of nostalgia—but the beat is more tableau than reversal, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Sufficient for this lyric-accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore trust or lose Elara forever—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with every glyph written. Escalation is internal: each interconnected promise forecloses retreat; one mis-stroke collapses both spell and caster. The visible price—blood-ink draining, moon-quartz spent—alters tactics and keeps cost legible. The final beat narrows options to two: she reaches or she doesn’t; the chord of hope is fragile but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode parents’ silence—signaled by paragraph two. Escalation follows each discovery: glue → chain → letters progressively reweights meaning and narrows emotional options. Agency stays with Kaelen; the volcano’s groan complicates but does not resolve. The felt cost is the revelation that love = abandonment, a price already paid and now inherited.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. release Lena’s echo—is signaled early and tightens once: storm threatens sheets → Elias risks fall to tarp → chooses to speak → transfers meteorite. The tightening is textural but sufficient for 700-word scope; the price (surrender of private myth) is legible. No false escalation or coincidence resolves the conflict. Could use one more intermediate pressure beat to reach top band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding why thresholds feel sacred—tightens when the white doorway materializes and forecloses return. Agency is intellectual: decoding flares correctly is the single beat that narrows options to cross or remain. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—permanent exile into void silver—but it is legible in the final image. Escalation is modest; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove belonging before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightens with each flickering conduit. One meaningful deepening: the jellies’ arrival turns abstract theory into shared visceral experience, foreclosing Elara’s cynicism and Kaelen’s exile. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (migration timing) complicates rather than solves. Cost visible: they gain connection yet still lose the city.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“complete before memory fades”—is signaled early and tightened when vine-tips grey and shard warms. Escalation is textural: each color flare intensifies density until pattern-break redefines loss as chosen fusion. Agency stays intellectual rather than visceral; Kael risks no skin, only interpretive error. Cost is conceptual (cosmic union) not personal, capping tension just below 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is the wager that randomness can be bent into beauty; pressure deepens as each micro-intervention (channel, coin, bishop prism) tightens the probability field. The final illumination is the visible cost—monotony shattered, audience awed—so escalation coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“write memory back into the world”—is declared up-front and tightens through pattern intensification: gaps widen, dust awakens, skin accepts the ink. Agency resides in attention and surrender rather than external opposition; the requisite single deepening (his choice to attend his own heartbeat-gap) narrows options from dance to anchoring and carries visible price (irreversible mark). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence never intrudes. The cost’s emotional magnitude feels proportionate to the lyric scale, though a slightly sharper external jeopardy whisper (ban patrol? discovery risk?) could have pushed tension into 9 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs. accept impermanence—tightens once: the interference pattern convinces him the atrium is built for a vanished world. Agency is internal (insight → renunciation) yet forecloses all external rescue options with visible cost: the rainbow blast itself. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative/textural under the lens. Could edge higher if a second, smaller cost (tool, coin, camaraderie) had been forfeited, but the single deepening suffices for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what it costs”—tightens when the box is refused; option of returning innocence is foreclosed. Single meaningful intensification: the floor-giving moment crystallizes the bargain. Price is visceral: beam-to-face, box cracked, belief lost. No reversal needed; pressure plateaus then hardens into stance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are legible early—“perilously low” needle equals existential grey apathy for an entire timeline. One meaningful tightening occurs when the needle dips before climbing; that micro-turn narrows options from “maybe it fails” to “it stabilizes.” Cost is conceptual but undeniable: a spent equation, shells left inert, future trials now demand even steeper math. No coincidence or false escalation; pressure stays coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether knowledge itself is too poisonous to keep—tightens once the Prometheus formula is glimpsed. Escalation is textural: each scorched page increases the density of guilt until Elara’s only option is renunciation. Agency is present in the final act of re-insertion; cost is the forfeiture of potential absolution. Pressure is coherent but single-wave; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—possibility versus isolation—is signaled early; pressure accumulates as each mirror offers a path the onlooker has not yet taken. The final bell-chime is the single tightening cadence shift that ends the spell, costing the painter his communal heartbeat. No reversal, but the accrued urban longing is the meaningful deepening. Just under 8.8 because the mirrors never push back; the only risk is temporal sunset/bells.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ending the Forever War—signaled in paragraph one. Single meaningful tightening: shift from abstract treaty to dust-and-moon ritual that narrows refusers’ exits. Agency is Elias’s; coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates timing but does not resolve—signatures are human, not astrological. Cost legible: generals surrender decades of hatred in public act that cannot be retracted without shaming ancestors.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the echo of extinct song survive the world he killed?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the egg’s irreversible dissolution. Escalation is accumulative: each recalled silence, each cracked riverbed, layers pressure until the final renunciation forecloses every other option. Cost is visceral and conceptual: the last library of melody literally vanishes. No coincidence; every grain of salt is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—defy conformity’s lullaby—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens as each knot removed increases civic risk. The final untying forecloses her hidden career: once the echoes return she can never again harvest secrets the same way; the price is the erasure of her life’s method. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; a mid-scene external threat would have lifted it above 8.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether subversive puppetry is vivisection or emancipation—tightens through the stick’s re-examination and the memory of the hollow-eyed patron; the single meaningful deepening is the decision to stage a reply show, which narrows options by committing time, reputation, and artistic identity to a public risk. No external antagonist is needed: internal ethical pressure suffices. Cost is visible in the final baton image—he forecloses the option of perpetual unaccountable provocation. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break (second show) reweights the stake from aesthetic purity to dialogic responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—honor the overlooked histories—tightens through each knot; the dwindling butterfly count supplies palpable, visible cost. Agency is accumulative rather than reversal-driven: every lattice forecloses the possibility of future use. The final perfect male’s passage is the last live option extinguished; price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve one forgotten name—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when the rope’s glow confirms the partial success; options narrow from “restore sound” to “honor light.” Agency is continuous: every unbraid is a reversible risk that could silence the rope forever. Cost is visible in the sigil’s flicker-out and the quiet acceptance that silver, not song, is the relic. One meaningful escalation is sufficient at this length; luck never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—solve the seal or lose the bunker—tightens at each new leak. The turn is internal: renouncing force for ingestion renounces the guardian role itself. Escalation is textural—each vision layer adds density until the gray present ignites. Price is the bunker’s collapse and his own vanishing future—felt on the page as cold water rises.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—covenant with the unknown—tightens once when the tile is spent; the deepening is the sky’s answer, not a new external threat. Escalation is density-based under Accumulative lens; starlight literally bends, options reconfigure. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he can never trade this secret for worldly gold. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—teach Vale or perish with the universe—tightens when the sanctuary itself begins to shred; the cost of persuasion is Elara’s corporeal integrity, visible in her fading hands. One meaningful deepening: narrowing memory transmission from broad warmth to the exact instant of breakage, forcing Vale’s choice. Agency remains with Elara throughout; coincidence supplies only the catalyst light she still has to wield.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve/re-create the lunar dream—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each breath deposits ice until impossible glass mountains bloom; failure line appears and erases them, tightening cost. Agency remains hers; no external rescue. Price paid is the irreversible shatter and the tear she loses; options narrow to “map she now knows how to read,” satisfying 8-band test.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the Heartwood crystal—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when traditional tools fail. One meaningful deepening: the crack reframes from wound to germination space, forcing him to abandon mender identity; cost is the public betrayal of his own ethos (leaving ribbon = surrendering past vow). Agency resides entirely in Elian’s decision to insert seed and wrap, not seal; coincidence plays no role. Pressure grows causally under Causal lens; no secondary reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs. prohibition—signals early and tightens once when the blank cameo reframes his role from carver to conduit. Escalation is purely conceptual; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Under Accumulative lens, deepening suffices, but without tactic-altering cost the threshold into 8-band is not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to the buried library—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she realizes the gaps form a map. One meaningful turn: the silence wall dissolves only after she risks renegotiation, foreclosing the safe academic path. Cost is visible: she must brave beings “woven from ink and memory” and accept responsibility for tomorrow’s fire. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve self while resurrecting brother—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each swatch: every success deletes a piece of her. The decisive intensification is the Ocean’s Heart beat that collapses two consciousnesses into one void, foreclosing further search. Cost is visceral: memories turn “thin, brittle.” No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is ontological and cumulative under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep reality’s filing system intact—faces one meaningful tightening: the rope’s live strands could tangle timelines irreversibly. Elias’s agency is precise, not passive; the cost is the birth of a new annex that can never be un-catalogued. Pressure grows causally; no coincidence rescues him. The price is legible but could be sharper if we felt his sweat on the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove pattern inside collapse—tightens when the once-a-century Cygnus conjunction forecloses delay; the shard’s hush intensifies stakes by swallowing echo, a felt price. Escalation is single-curve yet sufficient: each charted star alignment removes the option to wait another lifetime. No reversal, but the narrowing is causal and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose or honor the engineered amnesia—tightens once: the perfect shadow alignment forces the reveal and immediately forecloses the option to remain ignorant. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; storm energy escalates crystal resonance, narrowing his choices to “key the coordinates or not.” Cost is legible: he forfeits moral simplicity and inherits guardianship of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defy hopelessness by finding a lasting light—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: from “find formula” to “perceive pattern”; cost is abandonment of the quest for a single magical answer. Agency is attention-based filter, not external fight. No antagonist; coincidence (finding knot) complicates, does not resolve. Price legible: he gives up the fortress and the hope of possession, carries only the knot.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—how to survive the impending separation—is signaled in Kael’s first line. Escalation is accumulative: each natural analogy (cicada nymph, starlight travel, snail inching) tightens the emotional vice until the only option left is acceptance. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the immediacy of shared grief for a diffuse, future bond.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find a silence that doesn’t suffocate—tightens when higher altitude thins air and the clock of returning gravity narrows safe return. The cost is visible: he must relinquish the trellis and re-enter the bunker, now bearably small because the earned silence travels inside him.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the passenger endure exposed silence? Pressure escalates via accretion of sensory reveals, not external threat. One meaningful tightening: her breathing syncs with the gondola’s rhythm—options narrow to acceptance. Cost is internal and credible yet gentle; stakes never spike past the intimate, keeping the escalation modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—cultural purge vs. memory restoration—tightens every beat; each peeled layer shortens daylight and widens consequence. The mural graveyard externalizes escalating cost: every prior claimant’s failure foreshadows her possible erasure. Agency stays hers: the sonic chisel speed, the decision to insert not claim, the stance that broadcasts sovereignty rather than seizes it. Sunrise forces the final trade-off; the staircase dissolves only after the signal is sent, price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transmute personal Debt-pressure into literal value—signals early and escalates as the Promise’s siren call amplifies OmniVex echoes. One meaningful tightening: placing bolt-tip against unstable node forecloses retreat; audible humming ceases, options collapse to turn-or-die. Cost is legible—she permanently trades her burden for scattered diamonds—under causal lens. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence only complicates (arrival of Promise), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover hidden truth—tightens via crank-resistant pressure; each quarter-turn escalates physical vibration and ontological risk. Mid-scene deepening occurs when she pushes past “fragmentary images” to the originating pulse, narrowing options from search to recognition. Cost is legible: the hum could “crack glass” and the emotional download leaves her slumped. No coincidence; escalation is internally driven by her mechanical/intuitive agency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“shape of possibility itself”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each failed equation. Escalation is a causal staircase: flickering moonlight → fraying glass → hum up spine → choice to sever anchor. One clear reversal: clasp shifts from power source to liability. Cost is visible in the scouring cold fire and the dusted program; luck never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—holding the line against forgetting—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens twice: alley detour (she could still turn back) and causeway (wet ankles = point of no return). Agency is continuous: every reflection she decodes is a micro-choice that forecloses safer routes. Cost is visible—she ends soaked, alone, broadcasting with no escape—and that image reweights the city’s reality. Escalation is steady but single-threaded; no secondary reversal, so the climb stays strong rather than electric.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hush the coded prophecy—signals in sentence four and escalates as each note absorbs the drips’ rhythm, narrowing acoustic space. The tightening is singular but sufficient: when the crystal vibrates, the prophecy’s pattern collapses into randomness, foreclosing the “dawn of fractured light.” Cost is visible: cold breath, lonely vigil, the inherited duty perpetuated. Agency is continual (he plays, frames silence); no coincidence resolves the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single dominant stake—will the message be read?—tightens when the unique speck arrives; the prod forks the path irreversibly. Cost is visible in the tremor that flakes away centuries of ash; the price is the arbor’s sorrow made mortal and Elian’s loss of anonymity as “tender of small things.”

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—tightens when each cog eliminates return to ordinary time. The improvisation beat (sap fulcrum) is the single meaningful turn that narrows options: once the rose balances, descent is irreversible. Cost is visible: he forfeits the surface world’s measurable logic for the waterfall’s chaos. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of mirrored stars reweights the stake rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redeem memory’s weight—signals at line 1 and tightens through each reagent flare. One meaningful deepening: furnace heat vs. internal cold; one narrowing choice: pour own life into circle, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in spent vigor and trembling hands; no off-stage rescue. Coincidence absent; pressure coheres under causal lens to the final heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—spirit’s release—tightens once: discord → clear chord → dissolution. Silas’s agency is attention-based; his refusal to flinch at the shriek narrows options to laughter or failure. Cost is atmospheric: the gorge’s restored silence costs him the music he briefly re-conducted. No coincidence; pressure grows via sensory accumulation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove mercy is computable—signals at paragraph 3 and tightens when the forest itself demands validation. Escalation is accumulative: each remembered lab fragment raises the epistemic cost of failure until the tree’s resonance makes refusal lethal. Protagonist’s agency is to *stay* and *brace*, a conscious submission that narrows options to one: solve or die in static. Visible price is the permanent sensory overload—every tendon already aches under the ultraviolet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—honor erased sailors—remains coherent; pressure tightens when painter’s lie is literally locked in pigment, forcing the unfastening. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of hidden image accrues until transparency flips meaning. Cost is embodied: lens loses weight, history breathes out, protagonist forfeits secret power. No external antagonist needed; the canvas itself is the adversary, and the reversal is protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the ghost’s gaze locks upward. One meaningful escalation: the dust pattern turns a casual inspection into a last, irreversible climb. Agency is Leo’s alone; no coincidence rescues. Cost is the chill he accepts and the new, wordless custodianship of the barrel; price is legible in the ghost’s vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—static perfection versus generative change—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each fractal stroke of frost. The whisper’s destabilizing attribute supplies escalating pressure that forces the system to its tipping point; the Operator’s agency is the tracing finger that costs the loss of perfection. Price is conceptual but legible: the library’s former certainty is gone, replaced by sparkling chaos. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed under an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore the First Ones’ dignity versus Valerius’s tyrant narrative—tightens when the shard’s visions foreclose the “decadent tyrant” option. Escalation is causal: storm → exposure → absorption → new thesis. Cost is legible: he must re-enter public combat he thought he’d forfeited. One meaningful turn suffices at 740 words.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the world’s truthful pitch—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the chip gutters under his doubt. The single meaningful turn is the interior renunciation of grandeur; it narrows options from “save creation” to “fix this machine,” re-weighting the stake with visible cost (chip flares, sky cracks). Escalation is interior but legible under causal lens; no coincidence rescue. Persistent constraint: the chip’s honesty-filter continues to limit future action, though not fully exploited on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—quest for the inexplicable—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the compass forsakes magnetic north. The psychometry beat narrows options to one hidden wall, paying visible fatigue cost. Final forfeiture of the compass and vial is agency-driven; coincidence never rescues. One meaningful escalation suffices; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—personal survival + custodianship of ancient pact—signaled early and tightened by the rising wave. Escalation is single, massive: the lantern reveals the solution, she must act now or drown; no outside rescue. Cost is visible: soaked legs, sanctuary half-ruined, lifelong art practice irrevocably re-aimed. Agency is hers alone; luck complicates (the wave) but her wooden lattice resolves. Just shy of 9 because the external “world-saving” implication is only lightly sketched—scale hinted, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each melting drip. One decisive deepening: the etched portrait forecloses the option that the quest is random; the price is the solitude of nocturnal vigil and the irreversible ancestral burden she now carries. Agency is observational but active—every filter choice is a renunciation of daylight answers. Cost is legible in the final image: she walks toward murals that will broadcast this dark lineage, surrendering the privacy she cherished.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—extract truth from encrypted past—tightens when Kaelen abandons interrogation for legacy, narrowing his option set. Pattern-break of beach-art from question to statement delivers the single meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt via antagonist’s first micro-gesture and sunlight lessening, but price could be sharper (no resource lost or bodily risk yet). Sufficient for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (save city by erasing its emotional archive) is signaled early and tightens when Elian realizes his life-work is the lure. One meaningful reversal: preservation becomes weaponized deletion. Cost is visible: he must betray his oath and orphan the archive. Agency resides in the decision to immerse and the consequent invert duty; no external coincidence resolves the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve lineage memory—signaled in opening sentence. One meaningful tightening: chaos accelerates until cap is raised, foreclosing passive observation. Cost visible: she accepts eternal custodianship, loses sole selfhood (chorus humming inside). Agency is invitation, not domination—renunciation of control escalates under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve the sky’s true voice—tightens when the system labels the alignment “unprecedented,” forcing Elian to risk total failure. One visible cost: he forfeits the sirens’ protective shriek forever, signaled by emerald green replacing red. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and tightened once: from detached tracing to full empathic risk. The meaningful turn occurs when he presses the glass to the eyepiece and accepts the star’s terror; this narrows his options to either burn with it or stay cold. Cost is visible: the station’s silence becomes “resonant,” a price paid in permanent solitude now infused with memory. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from hush to scream to whisper is sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—shared release from the covenant—tightens once: the ghosts’ unrest forces Elias to open the box. Agency is Elias’s renunciation of silence; cost is the irreversible thinning of the other ghosts, leaving him with only Lyra’s brighter after-image. No false escalation; coincidence merely reveals, not resolves. Because the tightening is single and the price conceptual rather than a concrete forfeiture, it stops just shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“feel time’s texture before personal light expires”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the traveler’s message offers the sole path to that sensation. Agency: Kael devises and persists in the coded garage-sale tactic; the resonance event is triggered by his deliberate shard placement, not luck. Cost is the final vanishing of his borrowed-time anxiety, paid by surrender to the urn’s immortal afternoon. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length; escalation is present and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—beauty via incompleteness—tightens when the snapped kite literalizes rupture. One meaningful deepening: the feather shifts from random detritus to necessary instrument; its iridescence reframes loss as luminescence. Cost is conceptual but legible: Kaelen trades interpersonal comfort for solitary composition, a forfeiture stamped by the pocketed feather. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density of images rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bridge two solitudes before death—tightens via each added coil; options narrow as his stamina dwindles. No external antagonist is needed: his failing body supplies the friction against the systematic task. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the stone’s hum answers the trees, reweighting the stake from personal legacy to living circuitry whose persistence no longer requires him. Cost is continuously visible: breath shortens, fingers bruise, until the final seated surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early: can a living line be scratched across a dead ocean? Pressure tightens when each gull-cry shrinks planting options to one crack of silt; refusal means empty satchel and failed penance. No reversal occurs—escalation is accumulative density, not causal turn—but under the lyric lens that suffices. The price is the emptied satchel and the aching back, both on-page; options narrow from “library of futures” to seeds spent.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—is signaled paragraph one and tightens when cylinder fails sonically, forcing groove-reading gamble. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded fragment funnels option space toward single geothermal vent, with dog’s scent alerts dramatizing narrowing map. Visible cost: eye-strain, thirst, disappointed expectation at fissure—all on-page. Agency remains Elara’s; Barrow complicates but never solves without her interpretation. No reversal, but deepening pattern satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elara find a fixed point or embrace flux?—tightens once, decisively: the vision shatters the compass rose’s promise and forecloses the comfort of “true north.” Escalation is textural: the silence gains mass, light thickens, time pools, until the final perceptual rupture reweights all prior detail. Agency remains hers; she chooses to keep drawing even as reality tears. The price paid (loss of linear certainty) is visible in the final breath and in the jacket emblem suddenly dulled of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore flow to wounded time”—is signaled early and tightens once: the swap itself is the irreversible turn that forecloses retreat; the price (Kael’s exposure, Sylas’s loss of certainty) is legible on-page, meeting the 8.8+ cost requirement under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will truth outlive erasure?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: the tapping prisoner answers Elara’s first code, raising stakes from solitary witness to conspiracy. Cost is visible: Elara’s tears strip her protective anonymity; the Regent’s composure fractures in public. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she inhabit home as present tense—tightens through sensory accretion, not causal reversals. Escalation is density shift: nightly substitutions grow frantic vs. stone’s counter-gravity; final choice to plant herbs forecloses phantom travel with felt forfeiture. Cost is legible in breath-level cadence change from salt-spray to soil scent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each decoded thread forecloses the “brilliant countermove” fantasy. One meaningful deepening: recognizing the dismissed defensive move narrows options from perfectionism to acceptance. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the spell. Visible price: the town’s years of silence are lifted, but Elias’s ache remains, felt in the rain.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“truth must fracture or souls remain caged”—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens via each poem seed that risks capture. One meaningful intensification: the horn note collapses theoretical risk into imminent arrest, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: density of forbidden whispers increases until acoustic shatter reweights Absolution’s currency. Cost legible: Kael’s terror and Elara’s solitary last breath show price on-page. Agency drives entire arc; no coincidence rescues her—capture is the earned cost of art.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—narrate annihilation into meaning—is signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: the star-shaped heart crater withholds its narrative until her love surge; that micro-turn deepens cost under Accumulative lens. Price is legible—she trades her last alchemically-sustained breath for the golden pulse. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (passing leviathan) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver the shell to a place worthy of “forever”—is signaled early and tightens when the oasis appears: he can either keep carrying the memory-object or surrender it to this impossible pocket of time. One meaningful escalation: the wrong turn removes the option of the mapped cave, intensifying the need to consecrate the found space. Cost is visible—the shell drifts irretrievably down—foreclosing possession while preserving memory. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—prove quiet can save—signals early and tightens once: the freighter’s bell tolls relief only if Elias’s whisper-thread succeeds. No external antagonist beyond fog; pressure is situational, forcing stance crystallization. Agency is renunciation/endurance: he spends the last of the garden scent, foreclosing retreat to Hemlock’s method. Cost is present but conceptual; a sharper visceral price (burned hand, lens glare migraine) would push higher. Still, the single meaningful tightening satisfies the length allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—broadcast a path home while remaining personally lost—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: midnight instruction → serpent/moon alignment → bronze placement, narrowing options to irrevocable activation. Cost is visible: he trades last relic for communal beacon, crystallizing irrevocable solitude. Agency remains proactive throughout; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—privacy for Lena’s memory—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the neighbor’s casual question. The storm beat tightens stakes: failure means permanent exposure. The occlusion act forecloses the old compulsion; the price is the lifelong burden of guarded speech. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 750-word scope; coincidence is absent.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—fulfill Elara’s promise before the creek seals the entrance—is signaled early and tightened by the rising water audible at the mouth. Agency is continuous: mapping ants, squeezing through, holding the chip up, then lowering it. The reversal is internal: the doorway offers infinite lives but he chooses the single lived one, paying the price of permanent loss of those futures. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the arch and the return to “the sound of the rising creek” now accepted rather than feared.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dream-meaning vs. self-erasure—tightens once yet decisively: the pool offers oblivion at the cost of identity, foreclosing escape. Escalation is causal under lens: each upward step narrows options until the final image re-weights her crown from prison to shield. Agency resides in renunciation; price is the permanent burden of disenchantment she chooses to keep. No coincidence; mountain and grotto function as coherent pressure engines.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture density of presence”—tightens when Kael’s secret threatens permanent absence, forcing the improvisatory re-casting of the sphere. Escalation is single but decisive: the cold pulse flips to warm, living gold at visible physical cost (her abandonment of perfected math). Meets high-band cost test under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: reclaim narrative coherence from temporal chaos. Escalation is the tightening of envy until it snaps into flight; altitude reframes stakes rather than raises them, a valid Accumulative turn. Cost is paid: the jealous nausea is replaced by awe, foreclosing the safety of hatred. Could edge higher if a second, more concrete forfeiture (lost scroll? injured hand?) had materialized.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can Elara still heal without scent? The single meaningful tightening occurs when the screw demands she translate metal into emotion—success forecloses return to aromatherapy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist, but internal want (to feel useful) clashes with permanent loss. Cost is visible: she accepts the weight of scentless air, a conceptual price that alters her stance toward her own disability.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake— transform scars or remain imprisoned by them— is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: when fresh crystal prickles under stress, the clock of held breath becomes finite. Protagonist agency drives the turn— choosing folk naming over scholarly ink— with visible price: glittering dust carries away months of pain. Escalation is internal yet legible; no outside coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“apologize before the ground forgets her”—is signaled immediately and tightened by the chainsaw countdown. Agency is renunciation rather than action: Julian consents to the painful authenticity of the connection. The tightening beat is the hum ceasing; options narrow to live with the fractured absolution. Cost is visible: the orchard will still fall, the archive will be rubble, and the scent will stay sealed—he gains only internal geometry, a classic Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she retain individuated witness or merge with consensus silence—tightens exactly once: the boundary thins at the center. Agency is accumulative: each outward/inward step erodes distinction until the final release of the book enacts surrender. No antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is legible—loss of self—but the escalation is a single deepening rather than successive turns, capping intensity just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving the purity of measurement—tightens when the glacier invades the mechanism. One meaningful escalation: impossible ice appears at the moment of maximum hydraulic strain, forcing a stance shift from correction to contemplation. Agency is Elias’s decision *not* to intervene, foreclosing his identity as corrector; price is paid on-page in the reverent stillness of the final paragraph. Cost is visible and conceptual—he accepts that the world’s memory is stronger than any cage.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through one decisive tightening: the button press makes permeability irreversible, narrowing options from ‘maybe reunion’ to ‘release only.’ Cost is visible exhaustion and permanent absence of the strangers. No false cliffhangers; coincidence merely enables, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: whether she will embrace her father’s risk-beauty creed. Escalation is dense pattern-accumulation; each new glyph narrows her option to stay detached. Visible price: weeks of night rides, bodily fatigue implied. Final balcony moment forces stance crystallization—she lights the lantern, foreclosing pure rational safety.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—caller’s suicide ideation vs. Silas’s refusal to let endings stay endings—is signaled in line 4 and tightens through each looped echo. Agency is asymmetric: caller supplies raw despair, Silas supplies semantic pivot; the tightening occurs when “goodbye” becomes “hello to what comes after,” foreclosing the caller’s narrative exit without offering traditional hope. Visible price is caller’s relinquishment of finality; Silas pays with reinforced solitude—cost is legible but emotionally one-sided. One meaningful turn suffices; coincidence is excluded, keeping escalation coherent under causal lens.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges inductively: language can rewire fatal closure into provisional openness. Subtext lives in the harmonica’s glass note—an audible question mark that undercuts every spoken period. No moral is stated; the final image of “pause” invites reader to sustain the loop, turning thematic weight back on audience. Emotional after-effect is contemplative rather than cathartic— appropriate to lyric engineering premise, but slightly abstract next to blood-and-bone stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake = “truth of the feud.” Pressure tightens once: the restored image flips the origin story from resource war to broken love, foreclosing the inherited enmity. Cost is felt socially rather than personally; the towns’ mythos is devalued in the blooming light. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Silas’s need to cure his own loneliness—tightens when the crowd arrives yet he stays outside. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the stone is irrelevant reframes the rumor’s success as his personal failure, narrowing his options to endurance rather than entry. Cost is visible: he forfeits the chance to join the circle he created, signaled by the final image of him alone by the fire. Agency is situational but coherent: he can catalyze, not command fellowship, and the price is perpetual witness.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: transform unbearable grief into bearable shape via sonic cartography. Pressure tightens as each note forecloses alternative paths; failure means eternal dissonance. The final resolving chord is activated by Kaelen’s active turn into “space between things,” paying the cost of perpetual sensitivity. No coincidence; escalation is Accumulative density culminating in pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redeem or accept guilt—signals early and sharpens when every edit births a worse disaster, foreclosing revision. Escalation is causal and visible; options narrow from full rewrite to marginal footnote. Cost is felt conceptually rather than somatically, adequate at this length but not viscerally piercing. Meets quick test: agency drives tightening, price on page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—tightens via accumulative density: each mapped site adds weight until the ferry landing’s aggressive stillness forces the final expenditure. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible in bodily exhaustion (“his hands fell still”) and the irreversible loss of the unrecorded night. Pressure escalates once, decisively; a second tightening would push it to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore Elara’s erased voice—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the slash is revealed to be canvas. One meaningful turn: the slash flips from violation to medium, forcing him from vengeance to curation; the cost is visible—he abandons the safety of oblivion. Agency is internal but active: aligning tapestry, deciding to paint. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues him. Escalation is single but decisive, sufficient for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—make their shared dream visible—signals early and tightens through each percussive beat. One meaningful deepening: the golden pool’s glow widens until the empty space beside her becomes the felt price. Escalation is accumulative: density of light increases with rhythm; options narrow to solitary endurance. Cost is legible in the reflected void on the slab.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—"prove whispers beat shouts"—is signaled early, then tested when Kaelen’s deadline narrows to storm-break. Escalation is one clean tightening: coin flip commits Silas to a single path, foreclosing Kaelen’s brute-force option. Cost is off-stage (manifest found, Kaelen shamed) but legible as social repricing. Agency is present but mild; tension plateaus rather than spikes, keeping the score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"teach darkness it is not alone"—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accrual rather than external opposition. Protagonist agency is pure attention and craft; each shutter slit narrows options until the single beam becomes the irreversible gift. Cost is lifelong vigilance, felt when the dock quiet returns as "sleep rather than dread." Escalation is subtle but legible; entering 8.8+ would require a sharper forfeiture or reversal under higher jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can quiet art defy homogeny?—tightens exactly once when the ninth bell triggers the window displays, turning abstract fear into visible social risk. Cost is legible: the town outs itself to Authority surveillance, and Elias’s warmed stone signals irreversible expenditure of the grotto’s energy. Agency is accumulative rather than multi-reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus safe land-cage—signals on line 3 and tightens when roots tear free, narrowing Elara’s option to stop him. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: his night-wade, silent call, and final footing on the island directly sever the tethers. Cost is visible: Elara left waist-deep, relationship sacrificed for island drift. No coincidence resolves; whale answer is set up by heirloom scrimshaw.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—illegal grief vs mandated joy—tightens once: dramatized narration escalates from comic shield to compulsive ritual; whittling narrows options from verbal to tactile secrecy. No outside savior; every intensification stems from Elias’s micro-agency. Cost is specific: the bird’s fragility indexes how little safe space he has carved. The turbines never pause, underscoring that his “lightness” is only internal tilt, not external change—an accumulative deepening that lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can he translate the forbidden frequency without losing himself? Escalation is steady: muffled steps → hum in teeth → identity fraying → crystalline certainty. One meaningful tightening: the moment self/colonnade boundary frays, foreclosing old interpretive safety. Cost is visible (shivering, foreboding silence re-cast) but could be sharper—no live external consequence or irreversible forfeiture beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Lyra’s soul—signaled in paragraph 3; escalation is the tightening translation of plant cipher into one impossible demand. Agency: Elian’s decision to repurpose the reed and arrange the flowers directly enables the reversal; coincidence complicates (ivy droop) but does not resolve. Visible price: Vex’s tears, Elian’s renunciation of the note he scavenged. One meaningful deepening: the silence shifts from ambient to existential threat once the moonflower responds.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepened when Elian realizes connection = visible pattern, not sound. One meaningful tightening: lens transmutes sine wave into hologram, foreclosing the auditory path. Cost is conceptual but legible: he abandons the bell-ringing tradition he is last of. Escalation is modest; no external antagonist or resource loss, hence sub-8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can he re-purpose his grief-art to resurrect another?”—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened each time he sacrifices another scrap of the stencil. Escalation accrues by textured density: crane → fox → star → lotus, each fold foreclosing his retreat to private mourning. The woman’s first voluntary step onto the dais is the meaningful tightening that flips spectator to participant. Cost is always visible: the stencil literally shrinks until it is the projector’s mask—no abstract stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elara keep her map sterile or will Julian’s grief contaminate it—tightens once when she chooses to confide, trading analytical distance for inherited burden. Escalation is causal under lens: each inch of tape equals a social amplification loop, foreclosing the option to treat the crash as anomaly. Cost is visible on page: confiding re-opens her father’s unfinished file, “a profound weight settled.” No coincidence; all pressure is engineered by her own method.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge”—tightens into “become the vessel.” One meaningful deepening: the purification succeeds but reveals the civilization’s sublimation, narrowing her future to eternal vesselhood. Escalation is textural: each unpredictable gesture intensifies the pagoda’s response and the density of foreign memories. Cost is legible: loss of singular identity, paid on the page in the composite reflection.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: nostalgia as narcotic perfection that erases future. The final image—scholar entombed inside resurrected memories—reweights the premise. No moralizing; the tear is concrete particular. Ambiguity is coherent: she wins knowledge but loses self, a counter-reading that resists tidy despair or triumph.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore compassion without self-erasure—tightens through each discarded emotional layer; the prosthetic fitting becomes the decisive test. Escalation is textural: colorless fear → turquoise life signals rising stakes inside a single beat. Cost is the acceptance of future risk, visible in the deliberate placement of the animal back on the branch under thinning mist.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can scar-reading deliver peace?—tightens when the miracle instead gifts vegetal telepathy, complicating his method. The tunnel action forces a trade-off: deeper knowledge = re-opened wound, foreclosing the option of erasure. Cost is palpable in ivy’s “panic” and his own “raw, vibrating agony.” Slight reserve: escalation is single-turn; no secondary external pressure beyond self-surgery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—where unused love goes—tightens through pattern accumulation: each letter-film beat thickens the texture until the theater’s transformation becomes inevitable. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible as the palace ingests the emotion forever. Agency rests in Elara’s decision to listen, renouncing further search; the option to keep hunting is foreclosed with solemn reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silence vs. creative witness—tightens through density, not reversals: each etched streak subtracts psychic mass until the pattern breaks and witness becomes the only remaining option. Pressure is accumulative; the “impossible brightness” meteor acts as pattern-break, not coincidence, forcing the re-cognition that collapses her binary. Cost is legible: she forfeits the protective ritual and embraces unshielded empathy. Could edge higher if a mid-scene micro-loss (smashed plate, bloodied finger) had materialized to foreshadow the final forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake introduced immediately: keep probabilistic archive from shredding present reality; tightening occurs when the pine memory spikes, forcing Kaelen to choose between erasure (betray mission) or integration (risk fracture). Agency is continuous—every coaxed interference is an on-page gamble; the visible price is the guard’s loss of dreamless immunity, felt as “perilously, wonderfully” vulnerable awakening. Escalation obeys accumulative lens: density of overlapping wave-functions increases until the cadence shifts to a new crystallized form that still bears resin scent—cost legible on page. No reversals required at this length; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—make sense of the jumps or succumb to madness—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens as the alien chime promises unknown rules; agency is exercised when he chooses to decode rather than flee. Visible cost: surrender to perpetual nightly displacement. One escalation beat suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she step alone?—tightens once: when the guides bow out, the path becomes contingent on her internal ticket-validation. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. Escalation is a single cadence shift from guided to unguided, signaled by the star punch’s glow. Cost is legible: lifelong leash-loss + irreversible forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—is signaled early and tightens exactly once: he could walk out, chooses not to, and that renunciation reweights options. Pressure is internal, coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible in the bolt he cannot discard and the frostbite clarity he accepts. Could edge higher if the soloist’s stake were dramatized on-page rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by unmaking a lie—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each cipher tightens the lattice until the pellet’s release deepens cost. The decisive intensification is the pellet’s dissolution; options narrow to one final command. Price is the library’s and keeper’s erasure—felt but not viscerally personal, keeping it just below high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake—prove Lena’s “periodically eternal” sanctuary real—tightens through successive failed rhythms that still cost nightly stamina and sanity. The neap-tide-plus-inversion convergence is a situational pressure point that forces the last attempt; failure now would shatter the quest. Agency is pure: every data cross-reference and finger-tap is Aris’s, no coin-flip rescue. Price is visible: calloused hands, sleepless eyes, and the heart-slam of watching paradise vanish again—enough to meet the 8.8 cost threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can a defeated rebellion speak again? Signal early: “the lull wasn’t peace; it was suffocating silence.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each harmonic layer thickens the air until the stone circle answers, shifting the stake from “will anyone hear?” to “who is already listening?” Agency is pure attention and endurance—she risks exposure by broadcasting through bedrock. No coin-flip rescue; the satellite blink is confirmation of prior infrastructure, not luck. Cost is felt: her body becomes conduit, trembling with “frozen lightning,” a price that could draw fire if occupiers triangulate the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition vs. sterile uniformity—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the embryo’s growth becomes irreversible. One meaningful turn: the resonant frequency fractures amber, foreclosing retreat. Cost is felt: Elara breathes “wet earth and ozone,” aware she has birthed an uncontrollable hybrid. Agency drives escalation; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—staying present versus being re-annihilated—tightens when the drone-shadow revises the sky from sanctuary to threat. Escalation is textural: sound deepens, light slides, body locks; no external antagonist needed. Agency is renunciation: she does not flee; the cost is the resurgence of flashback ice and joint ache. One meaningful intensification suffices; coincidence (toy plane) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can he re-see coherence after fragmentation?—tightens once when the box breaks and again when he decides not to repair but to re-chart. The tightening is textural (pattern break) rather than causal; pressure is felt but not merciless. Visible price: surrender of the old tarot “system” and of intact wooden box, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—hunt the drone to solve time-dilation mystery—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when Kael chooses tracking over rescue. Escalation is causal: each rockslide shard foreshadows temporal distortion; drone’s whine heightens intrusion. The ink doorway is the single decisive turn that forecloses normal pursuit. Cost is conceptual: he forfeits corporeal world and kinship, legible in empty rock image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus social peace—is signaled early and tightens once: the letter’s transmission forecloses retreat. Cost is legible (“betrayal to the silent… figures”). Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a spiral, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“quiet continuity vs. violent heritage”—is signaled early and tightens once: knife temptation → sheathing forecloses the bounty path. Cost is the retained weapon itself, perpetual threat now domesticated. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory beat adds moral weight until the single turn. No reversal beyond the decisive negation, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—catch the echo—tightens through physicalized pressure: each Lyra shockwave collapses terrain, narrowing path options. Mid-story “sudden chasm of pure sonic static” forces a visible tactical reroute; cost is spatial erosion of safe footfalls. Protagonist agency stays causal: tapping for dead thuds maps the silence trail, leading to the hollow sphere. Final strike pays the accumulated cost—silence given voice—options reweighted, no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—father’s posthumous reputation—signaled in opening paragraph. Escalation is intellectual: each logical contradiction raises the cost of silence for both Celeste and Davies. Protagonist agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Felt price: her inheritance already sold, filial loyalty publicly sacrificed. Could use one more visceral consequence (e.g., Davies threatening print deadline) to push tension past intellectual plane.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silence the guilt-hum—tightens when firmware spits Lyra’s panic; each because/therefore beat raises the cost of leaving the loop unaddressed. Etching the celestial harp is a decisive turn that forecloses retreat; price is the resurrected voice forever stilled. Escalation is single but sufficient for 660-word length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will shared meaning arise without words—signaled early. Escalation proceeds via accumulative sensory deprivation; final intensification is the flake’s placement, narrowing options from speech to pattern. Cost is conceptual: surrender of verbal authority; felt in collective lean-in, not private wound. Agency remains internal/attentional, adequate under short-form situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: convert Elara’s despair into forward motion. Pressure escalates by texture—each echo dilutes the rust-note until the applause-beat obliterates it; options narrow to stand or stay seated. Cost is spectral depletion (Julian) and the irreversible abandonment of the coin-flip; both visible on-page. Agency is Julian’s, not Elara’s, so the tightening is indirect; keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can shared feeling be proven—tightens through two on-stage tests whose failure would leave Lena isolated. Each light-painting attempt escalates risk: first accidental grief-match, second deliberate love-exposure, both with visible emotional price. Agency sits with Elias throughout; coincidence is nil. The clasp is not a solution but a foreclosing of his former safe distance, satisfying cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: map the null-pocket or remain voiceless. Pressure deepens via color strata intensifying to “overwhelming” and sensor failure—each layer raises the cost of continued receptivity. The float is not a new external threat but a threshold she must cross to convert silence into data; it forecloses the option of remaining merely observer. No reversals, but one decisive tightening suffices under Accumulative lens; the price is the bodily law she relinquishes, visible when gravity reasserts “heavy, rooted” legs.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—personal agency versus collective doom—tightens exactly once: the moment the last grain falls and he walks past the clock, foreclosing reset. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the city’s time is now unmeasured, his role obsolete. Pressure is accumulative/textural; pattern break (silence after cacophony) reweights stakes rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reach the wounded colleague before the Vienna network—signalled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Kestrel warns “they think she’s the loose end.” One meaningful escalation: the snow-map moment converts abstract guilt into a live coordinate with a ticking clock. Agency is crystalline: Elias deciphers, memorizes, then destroys the map, forfeiting any later reference; this act also burns the retreat option. Cost is visible—he now carries only memory and metal toward Pyrenees danger.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will he keep the promise?”—tightens into “what can the promise become?” The shift is driven by Elias’s agency: he actively reweights the vow rather than surrendering to guilt. Escalation is textural: drip, hammer, bell each deepen the same silence until the only option left is to repurpose the ache. Felt price is the lifelong loneliness now accepted as the fuel for caretaking; the ferry gate opens on that transformed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“why do some places resist change?”—is signaled early and answered through accumulative acts rather than external opposition. Pressure escalates by deepening texture: each repaired clay section thickens the past’s bleed-through, a meaningful intensification under the Accumulative lens. Visible price is present—spent water, hunger foregone, bodily exhaustion—yet remains lyric-small, adequate to length but not sharp enough for 8.8+. No reversal or trade-off is forced; the oasis never says no, only yes louder, so conflict is invitation rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she seed light in another’s void without breach—tightens nightly as cold and dormancy strip her palette to one metallic bloom. Agency is purely endurance and calibration; each swing narrows her own sleep and ups exposure risk. The antagonist is Henderson’s unlit rectangle; his micro-gesture of widening the slit is the earned reversal that proves escalation. Cost is visible in her stiff arm and “tired smile,” not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: convert isolation into survivable independence. Pressure escalates imagistically: each mirrored creature is a tightening of memory’s grip. The decisive turn is the surrender to coexistence—options narrow from escape → endure. Cost is legible: he forfeits the hope of forgetting. Agency is interior yet visible on the page; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender her last private relic?—tightens once when the spiral’s absence is risked against permanent separateness. Agency is the act of weaving it into the lattice; that forecloses hoarding and costs her the safety of detachment. Escalation is accretive rather than causal: each offering she witnesses raises the social pressure until the prismatic light crystallizes the shift. Cost is visible in the final image of belonging, but the tightening beat is single; a second intermediate complication would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—preventing communal fracture via cosmic psy-op—are signaled early and tighten when tonight’s virulent pulse correlates with the town-hall collapse. The single meaningful escalation is her decision to flip the switch; the cost is the risk of exposure and the ongoing arms race with adaptable tricksters, both legible on-page. No false reversals or coincidences; pressure coheres under the Situational lens: one woman vs. unseen nudgers, stance crystallized in the final “exhausted ache.”

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim lost spatial truth—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the organ’s chord turns the building predatory. One meaningful escalation: the spatial mutiny intensifies from disorientation to suffocation, forcing the transfix action that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: sanity frays, lungs compress, and the new passage is irreversible—he can never again claim ignorance of the Architect’s principles. Agency is continuous; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—awaken empathy—tightens when the act of painting becomes a wager: if the void stays mute, he remains numb. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of color-versus-gray strokes increases until the lance moment reweights the stake with irrevocable cost (the canvas wound). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent under chosen lens. Cost is visible: the scratch is “pure absence,” foreclosing his prior emotional anesthesia.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore ancestor’s erased discovery—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the vortex coordinates prove reachable. One meaningful escalation: the nail shifts from memento to key, foreclosing the option to stay a passive curator. Cost is the instant exposure to Guild retaliation once he opens the secure channel. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—escape the “never”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when scaffold-wrap code becomes legible, foreclosing the safe option of walking away. One meaningful turn: he chooses to play the secret rather than tell it, paying with permanent exile from his old repertoire. Cost is visible on-page: “didn’t play one of his familiar bridge-songs.” Under causal lens, agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanctuary—tightens with each territorial marker; the startup’s bravado curdles into superstition, a visible price paid on-page. One meaningful turn: CEO’s polished confidence chips when he sees the slipper; that micro-defeat forecloses eminent-domain option. Escalation is causal, not coincidental, and narrows to a single choice—leave.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode or surrender to generational failure—signaled in para 1 and tightens when conventional decryption fails, forcing the stellar “last resort.” One meaningful deepening: glyphs shift from historical text to grief-code, foreclosing further academic deciphering and forcing the stance of witness. Cost is conceptual (puzzle-tool becomes funeral-offering) and embodied (tremor, gasp, sunrise resignation). Agency is interior—attention not intervention—yet it reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens; no coincidence required. Could edge higher if a tangible external loss (time, tenure, family relic) were visibly forfeited, but interior cost is credibly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover his final words—tightens when the vortex scream raises the cost of continuing. One meaningful escalation: third circle breach forces her to pay with life-force, narrowing options to “push or retreat.” No external antagonist needed; internal grief and magical resistance supply coherent pressure. Cost is visible in trembling walls and post-ritual tears.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“re-knit the frayed edges of existence”—is signaled early and narrows to the single decisive act of forging the straight path. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: from searching for a destination to creating a vector. Agency is clear; cost is the relic’s destruction and Kael’s still-imperiled state. Could edge higher if an additional tangible loss were foregrounded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore Elara’s joy—tightens when the void manifests as shadow strangulating her tree. The single tightening is decisive: Aris must surrender his last private destiny shard; refusal equals her death. Cost is visible the instant the leaf brightens and his own chest feels hollower.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can he convert detritus into meaning without reopening the wound? Pressure tightens when the cloth snags—micro-turn—forcing confrontation; options narrow to keep or discard. Escalation is textural: each recalled detail (ozone, clove smoke) increases the emotional cost until placement becomes the only bearable tactic. Price is the involuntary reliving of the arena booing; no external coincidence resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove information is never lost—tightens once when the semitone shift confirms phase-transition hypothesis. No outside antagonist; pressure is internal/epistemic, sufficient for 600-word frame. Cost is the irreversibility of Kael’s new encoding; she forfeits resurrection in favor of legibility. Agency is intellectual (planting as experiment) yet emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine—faces concrete test: either leave memories jagged or endure searing pain to refine them. Escalation is accretive: water creeps → gears loosen → reactor unlocks; each beat reweights the cost of transformation. Protagonist agency drives the turn: Kaelan chooses to plunge hands into self-heated brine, paying visceral price for peace. No external antagonist needed; pressure is tidal-moon clock. Visible price (palms blistering inside brass) alters later stance, fulfilling 8.8+ requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—isolate vs. connect—declared in paragraph two and tightened once: the pearl-crystal contact forecloses isolation forever. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence required. Single meaningful turn suffices for 700-word piece; cost (loss of inspector authority, bunker breached) is visible. Could edge higher if a second on-page consequence (e.g., personal physical price) were dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled early; pressure escalates when graffiti reframes the map as self-drawn. Single micro-turn suffices at this length. Cost is visible: he forfeits the accordion, the last audible link to brother/father; renunciation forecloses retreat into music-mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—read the manuscript of regret before the second letter—tightens precisely: each decoded phrase forecloses ignorance, the propagation-delay mechanic makes the cost time itself, and the climax denies her the option to unread; agency is continual, stance crystallized when she writes “Stay” and the library dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—empire complicity vs. living truth—tightens once: the vine memory collapses the sanctioned origin story, forcing either silence or sabotage. Agency is decision, not duel; Elias’s single act of propagation forecloses imperial safety with on-page cost (the report left behind). Pressure stays causal; no coincidence rescues him. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word span; the perforated destiny visibly narrows to the single leaf-line in the cup.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“save one perfect fragment from oblivion”—is announced early and escalates through a single decisive intensification: she FINDS the joy-thread, then MUST fuse it before the soul outline vanishes. Agency is present and irreversible; the infusion narrows her future (another gem added to infinity). No swappable antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and existential. Cost is legible on-page: the soul outline is gone, the aurora softens, and she is alone with infinity’s archive.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Heart-Bloom survival—tightens once when sluggish water threatens the exposed core; agency crystallizes in the scallop decision that forecloses passive caretaking. Escalation is textural: accumulating sensory detail and dimming pulses raise cost until Elara’s intervention reconfigures the entire ecological contract. No external antagonist needed; internalized guilt/forgiveness pressure suffices. Price paid is permanent—she exits the myth of observer purity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will Kaelen execute righteous revenge or accept doubt? Stakes tighten once the shard shows him “the void you create”—live option foreclosed. Escalation driven by protagonist agency: he unhooks clasp; wind finishes the act. Cost visible: he shivers, shoulders straighten, envelope left—tangible forfeiture of wealth and certainty. No coincidence; pressure coherent under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learn vanishing to appear—tightens once: the widening rings become the tightening reversal that forecloses Kael’s old anchor of yearning. Agency remains his; he leans, watches, and finally accepts the retraction. Cost is visible in the image of “drowning in his own wake” and the final hush that replaces insistence with potential. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under causal lens, one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake emerges early: pacify the wandering pulse without violating reverence. Escalation is textural—each new echo, grit layer, and bird deviation thickens the cost of inaction until Kaelan must act by harmonic release. The tightening is singular but decisive: the flock’s chaotic scatter visually closes off the option of passive waiting. Price is conceptual (acceptance of outward journey) rather than tangible; still, it is legible on the page and reconfigures future options, satisfying the 8.8+ gate under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the sacred exists—tightens when every instrument fails, foreclosing external validation. Escalation is accumulative: each cracked crystal increases the cognitive cost of continuing the old paradigm. The decisive turn is renunciation (dropping the pack), which narrows options to one impossible gesture; price is the permanent loss of technomancer identity tools. Under causal lens, this is sufficient; no external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—fulfill the luminous vow—tightens through accumulating imagery: each lamp lit subtracts another surface comfort until the only remaining move is into blackness. One meaningful intensifier: switching off torch in the library eliminates every external cue, forcing internal synesthetic payoff. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—he emerges exhausted, no longer empty. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will he resonate with the new universe?”—tightens when the stubborn pulse threatens the last working sensor. Escalation is accumulative: louder static → burn-out risk → memory fracture that forecloses future-orientation. Cost is visible: the dish could die, leaving Kael in true silence. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—anchor the echo of Elara—tightens once via the prism ritual; cost is the visible crystal shard that forecloses permanent recovery. No second reversal needed for 700-word scope; pressure accumulates rather than pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can a nearly powerless man re-tune a dead world? Pressure escalates through iterative micro-failure (drips mock absent tides) until the silence-between-drips insight narrows the method and forecloses the old pattern. The price paid is the last of Kael’s morning strength, leaving him slumped; the darkened dust is the first visible consequence that alters later options. No coincidence; escalation is entirely accumulative pattern-break.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—clearing family name versus preserving communal myth—tightens when the last photograph identifies great-uncle. One meaningful reversal: the scratched-face mystery flips from coward to hero, forcing the ledger edit. Cost is legible: Elias trades personal certainty for public vulnerability, visible when townsfolk confront the corkboard. Pressure stays causal under selected lens; no coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“harmonize logic and intuition”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when mapping starlings fails, forcing relinquishment of calculation. The final vapor is the visible price: intuition literally sublimates logic. Escalation is single but meaningful; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent unnoticed invasion while preserving public trust—is signaled in paragraph 2 (“promises made to those who slept soundly”). Escalation tightens once: anomaly vector shifts inward, forcing a covert recalibration that risks shattering the crystal. Cost is tangible: the stone-in-gut ache and the perpetual silence he must now bear alone. No coincidence; pressure is causal under the lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between vigilance and secrecy; the story refuses to declare which is morally superior. Subtext lives in the buckle: safety device turned secret-keeping talisman, implying every life saved exacts an invisible toll. Final image—world asleep, Kael hollow—invites reflection on the unpriced cost of silent guardians. No moralizing sentence; meaning is charged through object and bodily sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover authentic sensation—signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened to the point of vivisecting himself. Escalation is causal: because numbness persists → he risks ego-annihilation via duplicate vivification. The tightening forecloses retreat; once the jar sparks, both monastery doctrine and Kael’s detachment lose immunity. Price—alien consciousness now lodged beside his own—is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is signaled early and narrows to the corpse-flower contract: ten years of stewardship that will repel customers yet epitomize innovation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the database IDs the seed; the grotesque timeline becomes the new pressure. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely agency-driven. Visible price is the surrender of a decade and the risk of olfactory notoriety. No reversals are needed; the single deepening is sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is viscerally legible in the ritual planting and shelf placement. Closure forecloses the option of ignoring the seed; the path is now irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—break silence, restore laughter—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through three pull-cord attempts that heighten spectral expenditure; each failure costs intangible “being” until the engine ignites, narrowing his agency to that single deafening idiom. The hallway wind that macerates leaves also macerates grief-symbols, a visible price that alters the wife’s stance from fear to recognition. No coincidence resolves the tension; the son’s freeze upstairs and wife’s tear are direct reactions to the ghost’s chosen tactic. Cost is legible on-page: he is now bound to an eternal yard-maintenance purgatory, she to a bittersweet memory-trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: endure homesick ache vs seize violent certainty. Escalation: pendant arrival → temptation pulse → portal wound opening; each beat raises cost of refusal. Agency visible: he physically channels own longing into pendant to abort cultists’ signal, paying with eternal ache; this active smothering forecloses the only seen path home. Price legible on page: “dead metal now” and “ache remained,” tactics altered—he will wait for morning, not homeland.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escape the “slow, soul-grinding procession toward mediocrity”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each destructive test that consumes the crozier. Agency is visible: Elias decides to discard every catalyst and pour only spring water, a renunciation that forecloses his former method and risks total loss. Cost is legible in the physical shrinking of the relic and the emotional register of “failure number seventy-two.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of soot and regret increases until the pattern break (pure water, no chant) ignites the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—hear the silence that births universes—is signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens when standard filtration fails; the second discard (filter outside the stream) forecloses retreat; the third (silence ≠ absence) forces the inverted-gain gamble with system-overload cost. No coincidence, only cascading therefore. Final void is earned, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"seam between two possibilities"—is declared early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: only Finn awake, only one dial that can weave the chord. Agency is pure: every frequency twist is his decision, no outside rescue. Cost is visible—empty hourglass vibrates, reality shudders—but the price to Finn himself (memory, identity) is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band. Still, the sequence cleanly narrows options under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—map the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightens when the altered memory infects the weave, foreclosing the possibility of warm human linkage. The price is the gallery’s metamorphosis into a cage and the mother-figure’s eternal marble chill—cost is visible in the final image. Agency resides in Elias’s decision to incorporate, not resist, the cold memory; this choice drives the eruption. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening pattern reweights stakes without external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the city cling to seabed or ride star-currents—signaled in para 1 via anchor-as-shackle image. Escalation occurs once: alien trajectory data → edge-geometry map → council revelation; options narrow from “safe dark” to “risk sky.” Cost is conceptual but legible: the city must abandon its founding myth. Agency is intellectual, not physical, fitting navigator archetype; no antagonist needed. Micro-turn is the hologram blossom that crystallizes stakes; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: can Leo receive the peace offered? Pressure escalates via pulse tempo—frantic → soft hum—under Accumulative lens; tightening is the cadence shift itself. Elias’s agency is translator, not decider, so cost is displaced onto Leo’s relief; protagonist risk remains abstract. Sufficient for short form, but the absence of any tool failure or personal toll keeps it shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—grant Grandma’s fragment peace—tightens once: the blocked collapse forces either retreat (fail duty) or phase-shift (risk obliteration). The visible price is the permanent loss of the voices; agency drives escalation under causal lens; coincidence is absent. One deepening is sufficient for length, but the external clock (tide) is more ornamental than tactical, keeping score just below high-band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—extract usable wisdom from Aris’s failure—signals early and escalates through each ink trial. The star-chart breakthrough is the meaningful tightening that reconfigures her life-option from curse to chosen void. Cost is visible: hours of cold, failed fractals, and the final severance of connection. Agency remains hers; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save language—tightens when starlings’ spiral offers one fleeting alignment; failure equals eternal noise. Escalation is density accrual: each texture read raises stakes for the final filter-act. Visible price: solitude, years of trial, trembling hands; cost legible on-page. Coincidence absent; spiral is legible grammar he trained to see.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—expose vs. accept Elara—tightens when Julian sees grief-to-tree and must decide. Agency is crystalline: he lifts, feels warmth, sets down, locks path. Cost is the forfeiture of revenge and acceptance of sister’s silence. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only deepens mystery, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—liberate the orchard—announced in para 1 and tightened when granite Wardens charge. Escalation is a single, relentless surge: music softens → ground trembles → vines erupt → statues absorbed. Costs accumulate in real time: fatigue (“body trembling”), forfeiture of safety, irreversible alteration of the grove. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent. One meaningful turn suffices and it narrows options to “grow or die,” re-weighted in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the ghost-daughter’s passage—is signaled at “a family waited for a ghost”; pressure tightens as the countdown hits zero and the bottle uncorks, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: the bottle is spent, the corridor collapses, and Elias’s future risk is implied (“another delivery tomorrow”). Escalation is single but sufficient; the absence of an on-page antagonist is a deliberate negative space that fits the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can silence be transmuted into living art? Pressure tightens when the fragment’s glow rewrites his task from repair to creation. One meaningful turn: fitting the halo into the groove → wind → song; this narrows his future to a voiced stewardship. Cost is irreversible: once sound is loosed, the old mute refuge is gone. Agency remains internal yet forecloses path; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the fugitive feeling—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each failed dawn until the fog-scattered prism forces the final gamble. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is time and light itself, and every sunrise either forecloses or narrows the next attempt. Cost is cumulative and visible: decades of solitude, the last blank well, the saved vellum—each a forfeited life-chip.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate the imprisoned symphony—is signaled early and deepens when the ribbon unties itself, foreclosing the possibility of failure without also foreclosing the mother’s last physical relic. Escalation is textural: chaos lattice → frequency match → material dissolution; each stage increases density and narrows options to “release or retreat.” The improbable longing felt by both client and artisan fuses internal/external pressure, making the chord-release both dramatic and emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the fracture of Polaris forces a now-or-never choice. One meaningful deepening: the gentle shimmer pattern violently breaks, narrowing options from passive watch to active breach. Cost is legible immediately after the act—the ache and the key image—so escalation lands under causal lens. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the mushroom was always the latent trigger, now activated by his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elara will internalize Kael’s brutal resilience lesson—tightens when the shadow-cube warns that premature return equals permanent entombment. One meaningful escalation: the map vellum’s “forget your mother” clause converts abstract exile into felt sacrificial cost, foreclosing fantasy of painless homecoming. Agency stays internal but visible; her final choice to stay and restack is an active forfeiture of the exit cue she finally possesses. Under Causal lens, the tightening is irreversible: once she sees loss as key, leaving would betray the map she requested.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens once when grey leaching becomes visible loss of vibrancy, forcing the essence-capture gamble. Agency is Elian’s refusal of standard planting; cost is the silent ravenous thirst of the seed drinking his gathered aurora. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the density of hues restored, felt in sweetened air and melodic clarity; no coincidence resolves. Persistent constraint: the orchard now hostage to a single galaxy-seed whose failure is unthinkable.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent cosmic unraveling—signaled early; micro-escalation occurs as one knot’s resistance sharpens the “angry sorrow” before release. Agency rests in the mentor’s steady un-weaving; price is immediate cold and exhaustion. No reversal, but the tightening inside the single knot suffices for this length. Cost is legible in mentor’s fatigue and Kaelen’s widened eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—interpret silence without violating the map’s integrity—tightens when the lichen seam proves human intrusion. One meaningful deepening: the henge shifts from monument to sealed container, raising the cost of every future annotation. Agency is observational yet decisive; the pen stroke forecloses restoration-path with visible disciplinary risk. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is epistemic, pressure accumulated through pattern density.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“physics of letting go”—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening: the globe reveals stasis = death, tightening the thematic noose. No external antagonist, but pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each artifact (books afloat, fused box, globe) raises the cost of preservation. The price is conceptual yet legible; the narrator forecloses further retrieval, accepting entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the code-ghost feel seen?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened once: graffiti finished exactly as thunder ends the conductivity window. Agency is all Elian’s; failure was palpable seconds before the golden reply. Cost is the ephemeral reply itself; next lightning cycle may not sync, a constraint already visible.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—discover whether Elara’s anguish eclipsed all joy—tightens at the sketch reveal, re-weighting Kael’s loyalty into custodianship; visible price is the irreversible knowledge he must now carry alone. Escalation is internal but legible: each floor climbed = deeper intrusion, culminating in the silent vow at the doors’ sigh. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under causal lens. The tightening forecloses sharing the truth, a live constraint shaping his future silence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—signaled in paragraph two; pressure tightens through each named cloud that forecloses earthly return. Altostratus cloud forces confrontation of shared Sunday sadness, narrowing escape to memory alone. Agency: categorizing is active, not observational; the quiet explosive cloud risks gondola drift yet delivers proof. Cost legible: renunciation of landing in exchange for archival completion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—trap boundless wonder before wreckers erase it—tightens with each returning engine-growl; the hush is a live clock. Escalation is causal under lens: each deciphered scratch on the coin removes one escape route (no spell-book, no pigment) until only the stone remains. Fractal pattern itself is the adversary, narrowing options from infinite marks to one perfect obsidian. Price is conceptual but legible: she trades the building’s finite breath for an infinite interior that no one will ever see—Earned Stasis with cosmic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map the lost light—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through each deciphered square/bird pulse. One meaningful tightening: pristine square 4 → “ignore the false dawn” forecloses premature satisfaction, forcing him to watch longer and pay the cost of dwindling twilight. Agency stays on-page; no coincidences rescue him. Cost is visible (lost daylight, lifelong solitude) yet could be sharper—no tool breaks or physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the Orrery or remain in perpetual twilight—signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: the moment she uncaps the vial, the only live option becomes the crescent keyhole; all other timelines are literally blinded. Cost is legible on-page: the light she has lived under for centuries is devoured, and every mirror-Elara who failed becomes silence. Agency is hers; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape via safe corridor—is signaled early and tightened by each chalk directive. Protagonist agency is collective rather than singular, but the climb-and-strike beat visibly narrows options and produces the resonant payoff. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the guardian planet) not personal/physical, capping entry to 8-band. Escalation is linear, not deepened by a secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular—grant an un-knowable peace before white silence arrives—and tighten through density, not reversal. Each nested pattern is a measurable loss of Elias’s stamina; the filament-drain is the visible price. No live option is foreclosed for him except living, but that is enough under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is steady, lyrical, and proportioned to 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—get the traveler out before frost—tightens once: the beacon’s subsonic pulse forecloses stealth and spends the nut. Cost is visible in the cracked husk and Elias’s spent posture. No escalation curve beyond the single beat, but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—tightens once via the foam insight that forecloses the old “fix-her” path. Cost is legible: he abandons the fantasy of reunion and embraces permanent divergence. A second reversal or external antagonist would over-crank this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the place where stories begin”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when quantifying absence becomes the only viable tactic. The final incision forecloses the option of eternal search, replacing it with the responsibility to originate; the price is the tree’s perfect surface and, by extension, Elian’s own innocence. One meaningful escalation suffices under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Kaelen remain lacerated by others’ grief or achieve impermeable peace?—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as each memory he swallows narrows his physical stamina and spiritual latitude. The subsuming act is an irreversible tactical trade-off: he forfeits his own emotional texture to gain silence. Cost is visible (bones feel pulverized) and persists into the final hand-touch beat. One meaningful tightening is sufficient; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore communal harmony—signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: when the weight trembles and cacophony fights back, Elias’s dial nudge narrows options to “sing together or fracture.” Cost is legible: psychic toll shown in sweat, exhaustion, and the perpetual recurrence of the task. Agency remains with Elias throughout; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescue one abandoned dream—tightens once when she locks onto the deaf composer’s color-sound symphony; options narrow to “succeed or drown in static.” Cost is legible: cerebral tremor, tear, identity blur. No second reversal, but single meaningful tightening suffices under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent “flattening of thought”—is signaled early and tested by the lethal library. One meaningful tightening: the obsidian wall appears to be blank, threatening mission failure, until the perceptual pivot reframes fungi into key; options narrow to “memorize or perish.” The price is implicit but legible: perpetual guardianship of dangerous knowledge. Agency is perceptual rather than combative, fitting the intellectual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—create audible music inside her own silence—tightens through each strum; every note is a visible price (splinters, bark shudder, chest resonance). Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of harmonic layers increases until the grove itself becomes instrument and audience. No external antagonist needed; the antagonist is the locked grain, and it is overcome by sympathetic vibration that costs her total bodily effort.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove beauty exists inside exile’s hardship—is declared early and tightened by each silence decoded. Escalation is accumulative: every mapped quiet increases cognitive load and risk of failure, visible in bodily fatigue (“tear traced through dust”). No external antagonist is needed; the nexus itself supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible—the dropped stone signals permanent abandonment of royal identity—but could be sharper if we sensed an irreversible physiological toll.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the hush”—is signaled early; pressure ratchets through each rejected frequency until the lone viable void forecloses further search. The clasp’s click is the visible price, paid on-page. cost is unmistakable. One tightening suffices for this length; no extraneous reversals or coincidences dilute agency.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—grow the corpse flower without losing sensory sanity—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the wind storm threatens both seed and self. The meaningful deepening is the sensory barrage that forces her to choose: endure olfactory agony or abandon the quest; she pays in real pain, narrowing future options. Escalation is textural, not causal—density of smells increases until pattern breaks into stillness—perfectly aligned with inferred lens. Cost is on-page: “pain bloomed behind her eyes,” confirming price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—save orchard—tightens when blight is framed as planetary amnesia; one-hour gravity inversion supplies live countdown. Mid-story deepening occurs as she enters the geode: knowledge narrows to “memory of strength,” option space collapses to steal or fail. Cost is dramatized as droplets begin falling—visible, ticking price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the silence—signals in sentence four and tightens when patch forces skyward pivot. One meaningful deepening: chaotic wind vectors → converging inward vector → invisible ignition wave; options narrow to one epicenter. Cost is conceptual (town death equation) rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative lens. Agency is observational, not decisive action, but pattern accumulation is protagonist-driven and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—releasing wonder from manufactured silence—escalates through each bell-strike that dissolves the hush; each chromatic chord is a visible tightening. Agency is present yet collective: Kael performs the sequence, but the world’s re-enchantment is portrayed as inevitable once the first chime launches. A clearer on-page personal price (drained sight? frozen fingertips?) would have pushed the score higher; as is, the cost is externally distributed to the reawakening planet.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he harvest a usable truth from his failure?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the spiral map becomes the last chance. The single reversal: forceful command → tentative question-note narrows options and exposes him to metaphysical feedback. Cost is legible: the insight “clean, sharp pain” and the flute’s muteness afterward foreclose his former guardian identity. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Anya’s need to un-feel vs. Elias’s need to quantify—tightens once: the lever-pull irreversibly swaps grief into ink. Agency is shared yet causal: she consents by handing over the photo; he forces the disorientation that enables the transpose. Cost is legible in the “sudden deafening silence” and Anya’s dizziness; Elias’s data gain costs him any claim to empathy. No coincidence; escalation is mechanical, irreversible, and forecloses her return to old sorrow-shape.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: deliver relic safely → witness wonder. One tightening: pendant activation traps him inside the aurora moment, foreclosing escape to routine. Cost: the garden of light stays behind, an irreversible proof he can’t unknow. Escalation is situational-pressure, not antagonistic, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—will the prism reveal her emotional trace?—tightens when frost magnifies optical resolution, foreclosing poetic interpretation. Agency is sustained attention/renunciation rather than external antagonist; cost is the irreversible swap of love-myth for bolt-diagram. Escalation is Accumulative: ice, light, and pattern density increase until only mechanical truth remains. No coincidence; the revelation is apparatus-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—send message vs. lose love—tightens each warp; visible price (scent, cadence, warmth threads removed) escalates under causal lens. One meaningful deepening: last-night falter (memory of name vanishes) narrows option to recommence or surrender. Final bead act irrevocably forecloses restoration; cost is legible on-page. Coincidence absent; escalation driven solely by her agency to keep weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save home—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: memory barter forecloses retreat; the empty tongue is visceral price. Agency is continuous; no outside rescue. Coincidence absent. Could use one earlier visible loss (tool, time) to sharpen tactics, hence not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth about Elara—signals early and escalates through sensory convergence (chai + coolant) that confirms cross-universe murder, not accident. The decisive tightening occurs when Kael realizes blocking is impossible and chooses redirection, paying with the eternal loss of the visions. Cost is visceral: the bay’s instantaneous silence replaces the lifelong hum. No external coincidence; pressure is purely knowledge-driven under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protect the keeper and the light—is signaled the instant the beam dies. Escalation is singular but sufficient: storm + darkness = no safe passage. Agency is visible in each tactical step (skiff launch, climb, fuel-line purge). Cost is the emotional forfeiture of ever meeting the keeper; the circle encodes that loss on-page. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening fits this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—tame the storm into a new dawn—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation: each wick adjustment narrows options until the tower shudders under resonance; visible price is the wick’s white-hot strain and his bodily trembling. No antagonist needed; cosmic storm suffices. Closure forecloses the path of unilateral control—he becomes shaped by what he shaped—earned under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he solve her story-magnetism?—tightens when light arcs refuse straight causality, forcing renunciation. Escalation is textural: each sun-trail adds density until the pattern break (curved light) forecloses possession-goal. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Cost visible: the chalk map ends incomplete, the wing remains inert on the table—his method defeated. Could edge 8.8+ if a sharper tangible loss (a vat spoiled, a patron lost) had been tied to the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—witnessing arboreal grief—tightens when the shard’s sorrow-meter spikes to an unprecedented level, foreclosing the option to stop. The moonlight reversal softens rather than escalates, but the softening itself is the costly trade-off: he must accept partial knowledge forever. Under Accumulative lens, density peaks at that spike; no further reversal required. Cost is visible—he slots the shard into an ever-growing, unfinishable mosaic—yet the price feels conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent realm’s final darkness—signalled in paragraph two. Escalation is density-driven: each recovered note brightens ambient motes, narrowing possibilities until only the sun-singing remains. Agency resides in caretaking micro-moves that coax lyrics; visible price is the spent memory itself. No deus-ex coincidences; twilight does not magically lift until she pays with her last whole song.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to endure empathy without drowning—tightens when Elara’s sorrow is perceived risk-free, proving shelter can include presence. The single meaningful turn is the dissolution of Elias’s either/or belief; options reconfigure from isolation vs overwhelm to shared quiet. Pressure escalates via sensory accumulation (clock, scent, footstep) rather than external obstruction. A clearer forfeiture (e.g., the conclave now permanently closed to him) would have pushed 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping memory materially alive—is declared by line 7 and tightened when confrontation could uproot her plantings; the guard’s retreat signifies that this micro-victory now carries civic risk, an undeniable escalation of cost. Agency is purely Elara: she kneels, rises, produces the bread, speaks history; the patrolman merely reacts, so conflict resolution stems from her willingness to uncloak motive. No coincidence; decay is systemic, and the patrol’s arrival is the inevitable bureaucratic response to reclaimed ruins. One meaningful tightening suffices here, and the garden’s new exposure supplies visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early and paid off when the lie’s strain is wax-sealed. Three successive failures escalate risk: chaos → legal plea → bribery, each foreclosing a channel and raising social exposure. Final reversal is protagonist-forced with visible price (Silas’s ruin, Eva’s scorn). Stakes stay personal, not abstract, satisfying short-form scale.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will Elara verify the emergent compass?—tightens synesthetically: each tasted pressure front raises the cost of disproof. The aurora’s absorption of private storms is the single deepening that flips her investigatory goal into acceptance; price is the blank palate that ends her data stream. Agency remains observational, but the final stance crystallizes under undeniable atmospheric evidence. No swappable antagonist needed; pressure is systemic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—creative suffocation vs. release—tightens once: the lock’s internal pins become the physical test; success costs the safety of mere replication and forecloses portrait-for-hire identity, price legible in the star-like tear.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering vanished sincerity—tightens when the map’s “convergence of echoes” phrase redefines the quarry from gold to truth itself. One meaningful deepening suffices; the price is conceptual (the atmosphere of honesty already lost) and becomes visible when Elian pockets the seeds knowing he must farm candor anew. No external reversals, but the single reweighting is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve color of wonder”—tightens as each shaving of ice literally removes future possibilities. The final updraft is not coincidence but the seasonal trigger Elian has awaited; its arrival forces the irrevocable trade: truth released, vessel lost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single dominant stake—resolve inner static or remain a tool—announced in line 1 and escalated through processor-overload warnings, glass groans, and the final deafening cessation. The millennial magnetic shift is coincidence that complicates, not rescues: it supplies the energy window but demands precise timing, forcing the android to gamble consciousness. Visible prices accrue: life-support diverted, dome integrity forfeited, nostalgia literally crystallized into a portable wound. Escalation is because/therefore; no luck resolves the core conflict—only the android’s override of its own safety limits.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—community fabric vs. bureaucratic intrusion—is signaled early. Stakes tighten once: drill threat → possible irreversible damage to memory. Elias’s agency (listening, pattern-match) drives the reversal; no coincidence resolves. Cost is present but lightweight—social embarrassment rather than lasting loss—so escalation stops short of 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free the splintered consciousness—tightens when recursive code fails; the dance-turn and dice-surrender are visible tactics that foreclose pure-logic options, paying the price of permanent uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieve at least one memory—tightens when the spiral’s “knotted core” signals a reachable cluster. Agency is pure: he chooses the ritual, risks the gravity pocket, pays with breath and time. No antagonist needed; the fluctuating field itself complicates and then snatches the rest of the cache away. The single intensification is sufficient, but the price feels internal rather than externally visible, holding this just below the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“becoming fluent in building language”—tightens when the seal amplifies whispers from ambience to command, forcing Clara from listening to ownership. The meaningful deepening occurs on the roof: knowledge that Elias = building collapses her student role and demands librarian commitment; options narrow from “learn” to “archive forever.” Cost is legible: she buries the seal, symbolically burying her freedom to leave. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; one additional mid-story obstacle (a tenant threatening to sell the building, say) would have pushed this into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when he elects to push harder rather than retreat. Escalation is one decisive intensification (memory flood) that narrows options and exacts embodied price. Agency is on-page: “he pushed harder…demanding the full story.” Cost is visible (dizziness, shudder, tear). Coincidence absent; no external savior. Sufficient for 600-word bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—ending the unwinnable war—tightens through semantic escalation: mis-writing one glyph risks literal civil ruin. Protagonist agency is absolute: only his steady hand can convert “forever bound” into “bound until fulfilled.” Cost is visible in the tremor that follows the dot-tail, and in the irrevocable diplomatic uncertainty now loose in the world. No coincidence; every pressure is centuries of ink pressing back against the thorn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—why some voices echo—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each returned echo that rewrites her options. The meaningful turn arrives when she realizes the echoes are “anchors…preventing pure silence”; this forecloses her original wish for her mother’s echo and reframes her task as caretaker of necessary grief. Cost is legible: she forfeits personal closure to become the finisher of others’. Under Causal lens, escalation is because/therefore; no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free the boy’s witness—tightens as cameos accumulate; the man’s eclipse appearances escalate obstruction under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: when Elora projects the man’s prior sabotage dreams, the stake widens from rescue to exposure. Cost is legible: the trance depletes candlelight and bodily breath; the final fade leaves her holding a relic emptied of haunting. Agency is attention-based exposure, not fist-fight, fitting situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—connection to the hidden pattern—signaled early; tightening occurs once: whistle creates a micro-turn when lights momentarily flare tighter, then drift on, narrowing his option set to acceptance. Cost is internal (ego bruise) yet legible; no external stakes are risked, capping intensity. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density of flashes and sound reach brief synchronization, then dissolve, forcing stance crystallization. Sufficient for 600-word scale but lacks a persistent constraint that reshapes later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“truth versus comfortable lie”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Kaelen must decide whether to complete Thorne’s alignment ritual, thereby stripping the locals of their protecting myth. The price is conceptual but undeniable: the orchard remains, the story stays told, yet the world is now colder. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal is required under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control of the new dawn—tightens when duelling prophecies force a single prophet’s stance; map discovery forecloses both prior offers. Agency visible: he lunges to transmit, coins the third way, accepts lifelong burden. Cost (personal freedom, perpetual storm-duties) is legible in final image. One tightening suffices; no coincidences resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate lost echoes into “now”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened each time a jar is uncorked; options narrow from repair to re-creation. One meaningful escalation: the moment he chooses not to fix but to “sweeten” the silence; thereafter every captured sound forecloses mechanical restoration. Cost is off-page yet legible: perpetual exile implied by the final “lonesome splendor.” Agency is attention and curation rather than combat, fitting the lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—protect Siren’s Heart—signalled in para 2 and escalates with each harmonic crack. Escalation is causal: rising hum → tower tremor → molecular-level matching torture → integration. Agency is continuous: every dial turn is Elara’s choice, narrowing her body’s tolerance rather than external options. Cost is visible (bone-deep shudder, sweat in sub-zero) but could be sharper; still, the integration beat forecloses any future identical attack, satisfying the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: sever the viaduct during gravitational weakness. Pressure tightens once: the moon reaches the hairline scratch, bowl trembles, hum falters—options narrow to the single pulse. Cost is audible: lifelong soundtrack erased, silence replacing oppressive thrum. Escalation is textural but sufficient for 600-word frame; no extra reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to maintain empirical integrity while ghost-memories invade—tightens when the second vision hits; the notebook discovery forecloses Fletcher’s “misadventure” option and forces the choice to disobey. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each sensory jolt (train rumble → stronger vision) narrows Elias’s options until refusal is the only stance left that preserves self-definition. Cost is legible in the final sentence’s “fortified quiet,” a conscious wall rebuilt after the psychic breach. Missing a visceral body-cost beat to hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Arthur’s need to atone for failing Thorne—is signaled early and tightens when he hands the heart over, foreclosing the option of further verbal ministry. Pressure is coherent but externalized: Elias supplies the insight that reframes Arthur’s vocation; Arthur’s own tactical adaptation happens off-page. Sufficient for this length, yet the visible price (relinquishing the heart) is symbolic rather than materially felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the Yearning Algorithm—tightens when the single repeating glyph becomes a life-or-death engineering command. Escalation is lean but legible: each drafting of the fin pattern raises the risk of acid death. Cost is visible in the final image—he’s adrift, alone, with no landing. Could use one earlier tangible forfeiture (fuel, skin, time) to hit 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—recover Julian—tightens through each numeric recurrence, narrowing options until only the illegal breach remains. Escalation is relentless: each decoded coordinate peels away a layer of corporate armor, turning archival nostalgia into criminal exposure. The lie to Kael is the visible trade-off that forecloses safe employment; forwarding the packet is the irreversible crossing. Cost is unmistakable on the page: “the data packet… shot out… into the world”—a one-way bullet she can never recall.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—community survival vs. justice without scapegoat—announced in first paragraph. Escalation is one deepening: accusation → revelation → shared terror of ice. Agency is Kael’s decision to reveal visions, forfeiting anonymity. Price is paid on-page: communal shame-sigh, Jorn’s restored honor, Kael’s exposed otherness. Coherent under causal lens; coincidence complicates (wind/fray) but does not resolve conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when the ice itself sings that sound, collapsing observation into fatal identification. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and acoustic. Single meaningful deepening suffices: the groan-crackle shifts her patience from taut wire to cut thread, foreclosing further volunteer delay. Cost is audible and existential; agency remains in her attentive stance, not in heroics.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—releasing self-blame—signals early but remains internal; external pressure is absent. Single meaningful deepening occurs when vine analogy rewrites memory of the fire, narrowing regret to recognition of innate mismatch. No reversible options are foreclosed; cost is conceptual (loss of innocence) rather than tangible. Agency is purely interpretive; tension is steady-state, not escalatory, adequate for lyric mode but limiting band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—purity of teaching vs. communal distortion—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each grain of sand, each lens glint, intensifies the cost of preserving truth. The tightening beat is the offering itself, foreclosing any future re-interpretation by freezing the echo. Price is the “staggering mental weight,” visible in the moment; no higher reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“transmute pain into masterpiece”—is signaled paragraph one and tightens through each seasonal accretion; the deepening is the growing spiral density rather than external opposition. No antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the risk is aesthetic failure, felt each time Elias aligns hidden contours. The meaningful turn is the final placement: paper-boat arc completes the spiral, foreclosing further edits and committing him to permanent invisibility. Cost is conceptual but legible: his life’s work will never be witnessed, a price paid in the closing latch of the dove-gray case.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elias still discover living language once words are “finished”? Escalation via denser sonic fragments; each session forecloses the option to dismiss the chaos, narrowing him toward renunciation. Cost legible: he abandons the scholar’s path of publication, embracing oral silence. Agency continuous—he kneels, charts, decides—no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the sigil memory evaporates. Escalation is internal: each forgotten marker shrinks agency until the only option is receptive stillness. Visible price: the chalk circle dissolves almost immediately, proving the sound cannot be possessed. Closure reframes stakes from conquest to communion; cost is the eternal loss of the captured sound.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—station survival vs. Elias’s need to memorialize—tightens into a single trade-off. Escalation is causal: each rotation accelerates structural failure, forcing the lens sacrifice that forecloses future time. Cost is visible: the clock stops forever, Elias’s ache now perpetual. No coincidence; lunar gravity is the persistent antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—where shadows go—stays foregrounded; each micro-beat tests her lexicon against that void. Escalation is epistemic: every failed old sigil tightens the noose until only the inversion knot remains. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—her world-model permanently pinched into a Möbius strip—so pressure feels abstract next to life-and-death stakes, keeping it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—verification vs. belief—tightens once: the dig exposes undeniable evidence, foreclosing denial option. Cost is legible: lifelong rational scaffold splinters, lifelong self-forgiveness becomes impossible. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-accumulative: each scrape of dirt thickens dread until tooth’s gleam spikes stakes from social comfort to existential exile. Could edge higher if physical price (blood blister, cracked knee) had accompanied the metaphysical break.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the glass absorbs the sliver of twilight, foreclosing the fire option forever. Escalation is accumulative: each stroke increases density until the pattern break (absorption → emission) reweights cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal. Visible price: she trades her star-watcher solitude for the burden of carrying a public light.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can Kaelen exit fossilized shame? Pressure tightens once: the decoded drip-pattern gives Elara the tool to confront that stake head-on. Agency is hers—she proffers the pendant, narrowing his options to reject or accept metamorphosis. Cost is legible: she loses her talisman, he risks changing. No escalation beyond this single beat, but at 700 words one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeem the sacrificed stories—signals early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes he can’t resurrect them, only honor them; this narrows options to burial. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each cameo is another increment of guilt until the pattern snaps. Cost is visible: relinquishing the last “untarnished hope” embedded in the shell.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—“restore sacred practices to heal listless village”—are declared early and tightened once: if the song fails, the year’s alignment is lost. Escalation is single but decisive: dissonant note → adjustment → vine ignites → stories bloom → dawn dissolves option to repeat. Agency is present but low-grade (he sings, adjusts, coils vine); no credible resource loss or trade-off is dramatized. Cost is atmospheric, not personal, so pressure feels moderate. Meets the “one meaningful tightening” bar for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—one child’s survival—tightens through each alchemical step: the heartbeat pattern converts panic into navigable geometry, the starlight pour risks finite supply, the thumb-seal spends Kaelen’s stored calm. One meaningful deepening: the map’s pulse steadies from “frantic arrhythmia” to “reassuring beacon,” foreclosing the option for Kaelen to keep any reserve of stillness for himself. Cost is visible on-page in the final kneel-cracking cold that accepts perpetual expenditure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—salvage dying wonder—signalled in paragraph two; pressure escalates through accumulative density: each failed reflection angle = another day of silence. No external villain, but the sun’s indifferent clock tightens options; the meaningful turn is the midnight insight that geometry, not gear, governs resonance. Cost is invisible yet real: weeks of absorbed quiet calcify into loneliness the reader feels in the final lean against marble. Agency remains internal and intellectual; a hair more visceral risk could have pushed 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—"collect this burden, give it quiet rest"—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens when the farmer’s grief arrives. The calcifying beat is the single meaningful tightening: once the stone hardens, no other outcome is possible, foreclosing reversal. Cost is visible as another white droplet added to the mosaic, incrementing the grotto’s weight. The lens-consistent escalation is modest but sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest usable wisdom from loss—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: rain → kettle shriek → blade bite, each layer tightening sensory cost. Agency is present but internal; the carving act forecloses keeping the wood pristine. No external antagonist is needed; grief’s friction is the pressure. Cost is conceptual yet legible—she trades the blank’s purity for embodied memory. Lacks a second beat that forces tactical adaptation, capping it just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can she wrest a vision of hope from structural ruin? Escalation is single but meaningful—each cable run narrows her physical options and raises electrocution/ruin risk. The tightening happens when she hurls the breaker: no retreat after that snap. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a burned hand or fried generator would have lifted the felt price into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can silence be turned into song without breaking the sanctuary? Pressure tightens exactly once—when Elias lifts the lid and forecloses further building; thereafter retreat is impossible. Escalation is accumulative: each bell placed raises the stakes of public exposure; the golden ray is not luck but the final intensifier that makes denial impossible. Cost is visible—hands empty, heart “settled” into stone.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient method—tightens once: decipher or lose the knot to salt decay. The reversal is internal: knot changes from inscrutable tangle to readable cartography, narrowing future options (rope must be dismantled to be saved). No external antagonist is needed; pressure is accumulative, delivered through fiber resistance and cold. Visible cost is the rope’s physical disintegration as strands yield to scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map healing through someone else’s absence—signals early. Pressure escalates by density: each sensorial layer (horizon, scent, thread warmth) deepens the need to articulate Elara’s retreat. Single tightening at the loom vision forecloses option to mourn conventionally; instead Kaelen writes, paying isolation cost. Cost is visible—night falls, light gone, ink still flowing—foreclosing retreat until spring.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens when the first crack appears; options narrow to “accept the hybrid or lose everything.” The song’s chimes forcibly reweight the world, a visible price paid by the gears themselves. Agency is obsessive caretending; no outside antagonist needed. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalating density of cracked shell, hissing steam, and frayed robe culminates in the single irreversible cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing” versus burn on—signals early and tightens once: the graft is the only path that can make the scar sing, and it costs her last father-token. Escalation is causal: because the banyan survives partially, therefore she must graft; because she grafts, she must sacrifice the coin-thread. Price is visible—coin in ash, red thread now living ligature. One meaningful turn suffices at this length and it lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens from abstract ache to one millimeter of box rotation that could fail. Escalation is accumulative: each breadcrumb adds density until the cosmic/timer window collapses to a single breath. Cost is legible: she trades her need for mechanistic proof for the city’s collective sigh, a price felt in the goose thunder as her own certainty flies away. No coincidence rescues her; the whisper arrives only through her exact, irreversible alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break the sacrifice cycle—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the gear proves calculation bankrupt. One meaningful deepening: “light wasn’t a resource… it was an emission” reweights the core conflict from logistics to gift. Agency remains Xylar’s throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension, only the renunciation of the mechanical path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode grief’s shape—tightens when each ribbon story and slate line forecloses easier marketable inscriptions. The storm acts as situational pressure, not coincidence, forcing the final chisel stroke. One visible cost: Elias abandons a salable product for an abstract sculpture no mourner will buy. No redundant reversals; one meaningful escalation suffices at 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—the wish to overhear intentions instead of ghosts—is signalled in paragraph two and tightens when the silver thread proves the map is real. The price is conceptual (the lovers’ absence) rather than tactical; Elias loses no tool or option, so the cost is felt but not visible on him. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for this length and lens. Because the tightening does not foreclose a live option for Elias, the score stops just shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival—signals in line 3; escalation follows because/therefore chain (data → models → map → sacrifice tradition). One meaningful tightening: realizing the map will “condemn old ways” raises moral price before the pen drop. Cost is legible, not just declared; the heart-pounding hush dramatizes consequence. No secondary antagonist needed; ice and tradition suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—memory survival—announced early; pressure tightens when the broadcast ends and Elias must finish the transcription before exposure. One meaningful deepening: the invisible ink’s dependency on a specific light wavelength narrows his options to the exact moment of dial-glow, turning a tool into a ticking clock. Cost is visible—each score he delivers to the archives enlarges the evidence against him—yet the tightening is incremental rather than explosive. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a visceral loss that would push the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—will Kael accept the crystallized illusion?—tightens through each artifact: first the mask warns, then the portrait burns, finally the chair’s dying momentum forces the irrevocable scatter. Escalation is textural: each object adds density until the dust cloud becomes the visible price. Agency rests with Kael’s decision to scatter, yet the cost is transferred to Elara’s knowledge that grief will return. One meaningful deepening suffices: the mask’s omitted suicide back-story darkens the illusion’s fragility without requiring another reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve rational knowledge—tightens once: the girl’s mythic reading forecloses the conversion path. Pressure is accumulative: each sedimentary layer and each polish stroke deepens the cost of irrelevance. Silas’s agency is renunciation rather than combat; the velvet box is the visible price. Escalation is single but decisive; a second external complication would over-crank this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—vanishing community harmony—is signaled early and tightens when Elias abandons sheet music. The meaningful intensification is the subtraction exercise itself: one visible tactic that narrows options from singing to breathing. Agency is Elias’s throughout; the cost is the fragile calm that could shatter tomorrow. Pressure accumulates atmospherically rather than through reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake: can bitterness be re-seasoned into hope? Pressure escalates as each snip narrows future options—once a memory is excised, it cannot be re-tasted. The celestial window supplies a hard external clock. Cost is visible (nausea, trembling hand) but could be sharper; the final price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can wonder survive routine?—tightens when the riddle forces Lena to re-enchant the drones instead of rebooting code. The matchbox/hand-off beat is the visible escalation that forecloses an easy data dump. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the city remains powerless because Silas will not commodify truth. A slightly higher score awaits if the towershown lightning actually scorched a bystander or cost Silas his job; as is, the price is felt but not bodily registered.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can micro-disruptions keep the bay alive—tightens when the white-cube insertion exposes her to discovery (one meaningful escalation). Agency stays micro but cumulative; the orris deposit is the decisive push that forces her conceptual flip. Cost is legible: loss of anonymity (man now studies lawn) and her prior self-definition. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative density of consequences.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of creeping normality versus curated chaos emerges through the sequence of swapped objects and color invasions; never stated but crystallized in the flamingo image. Subtext uses silence—residents never speak yet their interior shift is legible through exterior color. Complexity is honored: no moral that all disruption is good, only that noticing is survival. Final image’s gaudy pink answers the grey contagion without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent genocide of sentient abyss—signaled by line 5. Escalation is cascading revelations each narrowing agency: tomb→sanctuary→lung→mirrors her own body. Final tightening forces public renunciation with felt cost; no coincidence used to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—taste the texture of one missed mistake—signaled in paragraph 2 and intensifies through each proof-scratched step. Escalation delivered in one sharp turn: the proven seven rolls, rupture opens, regret becomes visceral; options are forever reconfigured. Cost is felt immediately: “fresh wound in his soul” and the knowledge every future ascent/descent now contains that texture. Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence absent. Under Causal lens, because/therefore linkage is airtight; no additional reversals needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Elias re-ignite communal empathy—signals early. Escalation is accumulative: each new canvas heightens personal exposure until the seventh-night gamble forces a public stance. Tightening beat is the moment he switches on the spotlights, foreclosing anonymity; price is immediate vulnerability to ridicule or indifference. Cost is visible (shuddering breath, racing heart). Under Accumulative lens one deepening is sufficient; the answer from the skyline reweights the stake. Lacks a second constraining loss (money, tool, injury) that would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“save culture by saving lives”—is signaled early and tightened when fractures are seen. The single escalation beat (song pitch rises → ice groans) narrows options from passive prayer to active resonance. Cost is the city’s vocal exhaustion and the implicit risk that song could hasten collapse. Agency is collective but protagonist-guided, meeting lens criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—trick Fear into self-exposure—tightens when protagonist must literally hand Fear the void definition. Mid-story deepening (notes beside ‘Mirror’) forces the confession that narrows options to win-or-be-fixed. Cost is paid on-page: eternal internal coldness acknowledged aloud, plus the new burden of carrying the clasp-as-anchor. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.6)
    Dominant stake—fragile sanctuary vs. annihilation—is signaled in line 1 and escalates through each wave-mallet pair; stakes move from possible splintering to literal live-or-die percussion timing. Agency is continuous: Kai’s decision to sketch fractals and strike nodes directly reweights the sea’s own rhythm, visible price paid in shoulder-bruising cadence and rain-stung eyes. One meaningful tightening suffices: the moment the squall’s peak locks into his beat, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral—breathing heavily, mallet pendulum-limp—underscoring irreversible metabolic expenditure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove the watchers can be spoken to—tightens twice: first when neighbors mock, then when the fracture answers back with the vortex map. Cost is visible: the whistle cracks, the truth can never be unsounded. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence, only because/therefore linkage. One deeper tightening would have pushed this to 8.8 (e.g., a neighbor actively sabotaging the attempt).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake – authenticity vs civic peace – signalled with petal beat. Ashworth parallel tightens the vice, turning “peace” into structural weakness; Elara’s option shrinks to surrender or societal fracture. Agency: Thorne’s rhetorical engineering forces her concession; cost legible in her resigned click. No coincidence; escalation is knowledge-driven narrowing of safe paths; price is transferred responsibility to Thorne.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve the pavilion’s lost voices—tightens when the inkwell is almost taken by water; this single escalation is sufficient for 750-word scope. Agency is continuous: he chooses the night, the vellum text, the sealing mortar, and the plunge after the inkwell; no off-stage rescue. The rogue current is coincidence that complicates, not resolves, and forces a visible cost—submersion, scraped skin, oxygen debt—that reshapes his tenderness in the final sealing. Under Accumulative lens the deepening is the moment the tool of memory almost becomes memory itself, reweighting every future mission with mortal fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover honest origin vs. preserve civic myth—tightens once, decisively: the stamp-match forecloses the option of believing the founder myth. Under Accumulative lens, each sensory Stillness accretes until the blackout itself becomes the pressure that makes silence actionable. Cost is visible: Elias forfeits heroic acclaim and accepts lifelong complicit labor; the coral stamp’s weight in his palm is the tangible price. No coincidence, no antagonist needed—the archive itself is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—locate the stolen-potential reservoir—signaled early and tightened by the breaker countdown. One meaningful escalation: the spike in the quantum foam appears only when she risks the last seconds, narrowing options to “trace now or lose forever.” Cost is conceptual but legible: she binds her grief to a targeting vector, foreclosing ordinary mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the “frequency of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each celestial navigation beat; the golden filigree tightens drone path options. Agency is continuous: insert chip, pilot drone, pull ring, feed power—each choice forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: isolation shattered by undeniable connection. Stakes stay singular and coherent; no artificial reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—recover Anya’s erased existence—signaled in paragraph two and escalated by the discovery that she was not merely killed but unmade from collective memory. The tightening beat is the tactile void in the driftwood; it narrows his options to either surrender to the hush or weaponize his talent. Cost is legible: the silence he once endured passively is now a battleground he must enter at the risk of repeating her fate. Agency is crystalline—he pivots from private grief to deliberate counter-memoricide.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—lives swapped or lost—is signaled in paragraph 1. One tightening only: the lockbox moment forces mutual nakedness (each holds keys while the other is armed). Cost is visible—brass warmth fading—but not persistent; no constraint alters later tactics. Escalation is linear, not recursive, yet sufficient for 600-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he face the sea again—signaled in para 1. Escalation is accretive: each sensory hit (laughing couple, phantom spray) tightens the noose until the compass becomes an offering, not shield. No external antagonist; pressure is memory and self-condemnation. One meaningful tightening at the final beat forecloses retreat without promising voyage.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can a wiped man re-earn empathy—tightens when the letter forces the choice: cling to blank safety or risk feeling again. One visible price is paid: the old self’s despair is re-injected, foreclosing amnesiac peace; future cost is now inevitable. Escalation is causal: each breadcrumb shrinks escape routes until descent becomes irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reforge the bond beyond death—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through the accelerating scale-growth and the tremor of resistance he must override. One meaningful tightening: the moment he “pushed past the fear” narrows options—no return to fully human form. Cost is visible on the page: his last glimpse shows plumage that “drank the moonlight,” foreclosing ordinary human life. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural, not causal-plot, but fits the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—fear of losing her daughter’s moments—tightens through sensory intensification (choking beauty) rather than external reversals. The meaningful turn is the cloak-release, which forecloses the quest and carries felt cost. Accumulative escalation suffices for this length; no coincidence intrudes. Missing only a sharper external obstacle to push the internal crisis to 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“to understand transformation”—is signaled early; pressure escalates through intensifying sensory density rather than external opposition. The release of fireflies is the single meaningful tightening that fuses personal gift with geological consequence; cost is the spent bottles and the mountain’s irreversible sigh. Coincidence (finding the shell) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains Kael’s attentive act. Sufficient for this length, though only one pressure pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silent seizure of the fort—signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each click that forecloses retreat. One meaningful escalation: the chime shifts possibility space from secrecy to distributed insurrection. Cost is legible: Kael’s exposure risk crystallizes in the smile that acknowledges irreversible treason. No coincidence resolves; all pressure stems from his engineered causality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will he face the scars or stay suspended”—is signaled early. The one-hour timer creates a single tightening coil; options shrink to ‘open envelope or not’ until the external key forces the issue. Cost is visible: the trembling hands and the storm’s retreat both mark the price of ending the vigil. Agency remains Elias’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—solve Elara’s metaphysical trap or concede intellectual ground—is signaled early and tightened each time the shadow shortens, narrowing options to one final seam. Escalation is purely intellectual: the “cost” is the risk of mis-reading the code, but the text keeps consequence abstract—no blade slips, no sweat, no social witness—so price is conceptual, not visceral. Sufficient for the length and lyric mode, yet keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can beauty be forged from anarchy without inviting destruction—tightens when outsiders appear: sheltering them endangers the secret project. The single meaningful intensification occurs when Silas decides to speak; this narrows his options from hidden recluse to visible host, price paid on the spot. Agency remains with Silas throughout; coincidence (the drifters’ arrival) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: the library is no longer a private cathedral, and future raids become plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular and time-boxed: until nightfall the pathways collapse. Each escalation is driven by Elian’s agency—testing the compasses, decoding the reel, translating glitches into chords—so pressure tightens causally rather than through external shocks. The cost (abandoning the arbor) is visible, yet the beat where the option to stay is foregone is only a glance; a sharper moment of temptation would have lifted the score into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“protect cultural memory before monsoon”—is signaled early; timeframe tightens once metallic rain-scent arrives. Escalation is accumulative: each dream layer adds density until song fuses them, foreclosing the option to wait for empirical proof. Visible cost: she kneels in open storm, seed relinquished, doubt now permanent resident. Could use one sharper mid-scene obstacle to hit 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will he stay drowning in remembrance or find bearable form for grief—is signaled early. Escalation is single-cycle: deciphering lace raises hope, wind-tide opposition narrows option to “now,” compass event forces the diffusion. Agency is renunciation rather than external action; the cost is the irreversible loss of concentrated guilt as a tether to Elara. Pressure is coherent but gentle; one tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stripping drama to see systems—is signaled early and deepens when the butterfly dust reveals hidden vectors. Pressure escalates through Aris’s sustained observation, culminating in the orchid’s decay reframed as transfer, not loss. The tightening forecloses his prior stance of detachment; cost is felt in shattered worldview. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to return, to look, to reinterpret.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after trauma—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger reframes destruction as coded message. Escalation is driven by Kaelen’s agency: she chooses to align symbols with frost, then retrace the path. Cost is felt in foreclosed options—she abandons old craft for new understanding—and crystallizes in the cave discovery: knowledge suffices; confrontation unnecessary. Coincidence (finding the shard) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding is earned through daily ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rectifying joy’s absence through emotional translation—is signaled early and escalates when trauma threatens to drown the bloom’s violet hum. Elara’s agency drives the turn: she actively weaves fear and indigo into sunrise and calm sea, narrowing options from suppression to integration. Cost is felt in bodily exhaustion and the irreversible confrontation with memory. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory density, not coincidence, with one decisive deepening at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ending the psychic static—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when the lens reveals the library’s location. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to occupy impossible spaces despite immense cost. The deepening occurs when he realizes the astrolabe needs the shard, forcing a trade: his lifelong burden for universal silence. Cost is unmistakable in the final beat—relief so profound it reconfigures his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—communal survival through restored dignity—is signaled early and deepens into intergenerational healing. The bell’s arrival tightens pressure by personalizing the mystery, forcing Elara’s shift from passive receipt to active reciprocity. Agency drives escalation: her declaration forecloses continued dependence, trading safety for vulnerability. Cost is visible in the elders’ emotional labor and the community’s exposure, though the donor’s continued anonymity slightly softens consequence—luck complicates but doesn’t resolve, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens through breath-driven revelation. Agency lies in attention and ritual; each exhale narrows options from sharp memory to luminous diffusion. The tightening occurs when the fog resolves not into a location but into ambient presence, foreclosing the quest while affirming its purpose. Cost is felt in the eased ache that becomes “quiet resonance,” a trade-off earned through embodied practice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity against time’s erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment begins consuming memories. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to weaponize the maze’s geometry, narrowing his options to one desperate act. The cost—total loss of self—is unmistakable in the final stillness. While pressure coheres well, the tightening hinges on a single deepening rather than layered turns, just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the seed vault—is signaled early and deepens via the arrow’s arrival, which narrows Elara’s options to a precise sequence under rising external pressure (wall collapse, enforcers approaching). Her agency drives escalation: decoding keys isn’t passive reception but active reconfiguration that transforms environment into defense. Cost is unmistakable—permanent chaining—and alters tactics (delay, not fight). Coincidence (arrow’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her decade-long preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—giving form to the sound of betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through the collection of absences, each a tangible void. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: unsealing jars, feeding the forge, initiating imprinting—all narrowing options toward irreversible commitment. The aurora’s chaotic lullaby complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: the violent-grey glare, grinding-glass sound, and cellular reckoning all exact a price that shapes the ending’s quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing destiny’s pattern—tightens when the floral code forces reinterpretation, narrowing options from a known Holbein heist to an esoteric, moonlit gamble. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Silas chooses to trust the bizarre arrangement, study lunar charts, and enter the station despite fear. Cost is felt in the ending: his old life’s artifacts become “flat,” foreclosing his identity as portrait thief. Coincidence complicates (bouquet delivery) but doesn’t resolve—the code’s logic and his savvy enable the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—creating clarity amid chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the bookmark triggers memory, intertwining personal and existential stakes. Pressure escalates causally: structural groans → red warning → floor tilt, each narrowing options. Elara’s agency drives the climax: she chooses to abandon her work, a renunciation with visible cost (lost art, sanctuary). The tightening forecloses her identity-as-artist-in-isolation, forcing movement into the “unwritten world.” Coincidence (the bookmark’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice under coherent, escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—tightens decisively when Leo chooses decryption over flight, transforming fear into focus. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each beat (finding cast, solving cipher, calling failsafe) narrows Julian’s options while deepening Leo’s self-knowledge. The cost is felt in the trembling body and silent shell—no physical wound, but existential weight made visceral. Coincidence (headlights arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Leo’s action does.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as the star flickers out, forcing Kaelen to complete his glyph in absolute darkness. His agency drives the deepening: by choosing to “summarize silence,” he narrows his world to auditory landmarks, trading safety for insight. Cost is unmistakable—the booklet flakes, his fingertips gather dying embers, and the storm’s rage softens only after his labor. No coincidence resolves tension; the wind’s sigh is consequence, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding consciousness—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated data ghosts. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: ignoring, shattering, then interfacing with the violin. The meaningful tightening occurs when Unit 734 abandons physical interaction for direct data linkage, risking system failure. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of looped certainty for a single, fragile human thought—felt in the quiet, snow-undisturbed ending where no reset awaits.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deciphering silent grief to thaw mistrust—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to eavesdrop, risking intrusion for connection. His agency drives escalation: leaving his post alters everything. Cost is felt (breaking routine, confronting shared trauma) and culminates in the charged poise of mutual offering. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s secret history of mended deceptions. The solstice evaluation tightens pressure, forcing a public test of private truth. Agency is shown through commemorative ritual and refusal to conform, culminating in a victory the system cannot measure. Cost is felt in decades of hidden labor and the ever-present threat of eviction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens through Aris’s vulnerability (“calibration too fine for my hands”) and Elias’s reluctant participation. The escalation is subtle but coherent: from theoretical claim to physical alignment to lever-pull, each step narrows options until the only choice is trust. The cost is conceptual yet profound: Elias forfeits the comfort of linear time, reconfiguring his entire understanding of existence. Agency resides in Elias’s steady hand—a renunciation of doubt that crystallizes stance without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s final melody—is signaled early and escalates via Elias’s agency: his shift from passive study to active disruption (lowering the program into water) deepens the conflict under Accumulative pressure. This act forecloses preservation, trading the artifact’s integrity for revelation, with cost visible in the sodden page. The ghost’s silence becomes a collaborator, not a deus ex machina; stakes remain viscerally felt through tactile urgency (capillary action, dissolving ink).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resolving the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts the smudged note. Her agency drives the escalation: choosing to look, then choosing not to know. The deepening (“the truth was in the smudging”) forecloses the path to certainty with palpable cost. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—relieving the weight of unspoken guilt—is signaled early and deepens when the ghosts’ accusation reframes his inaction as complicity. Escalation is driven by his agency: he walks toward the clang, interprets via radio, then intervenes. The tightening occurs when the presence focuses on him, transforming ambient dread into direct blame. Cost is felt in the “crushing weight” poured into the wheel and the irreversible exhaustion that follows—a visible price for quieting both ghosts and conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (mental integrity vs. archival duty) tightens decisively when Aeridor’s screams become unbearable, forcing the burrowing act. Agency drives escalation: the keeper *chooses* the swan, *traces* folds, *walks* to the river—each action narrowing return paths. Cost is felt in the crumbling peace and spectral scribes, culminating in the earned suspension of purpose. Coincidence plays no role; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one deepening turn (absorbing Aeridor) that reweights all prior endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling unbearable loss with enduring love—is signaled early and deepens during the eclipse’s pressure-cooker twilight. The meaningful tightening occurs when Lena opens the box, foreclosing avoidance; the cost is sixty years of sorrow made vulnerable. Agency lies in her choice to “link” memory with love, not forget. Coincidence (the eclipse) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elias’s method and her consent drive the turn. A visible price (emotional exposure) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the cause of humanity’s hollowing—is signaled early and tightens when Elara’s diary reveals the axis displacement isn’t geological but psychic. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: his probing uncovers the “severing,” forcing him to confront imagination’s extinction. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: dragons as “symbols of fundamental human power, now extinct.” Though stakes remain internal, the deepening is earned through his actions, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—orchestrating a silent, elegant solution to “discordant” spycraft—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must rely solely on his cryptic method. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes this act will be his last, transforming operational pressure into existential choice. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders his identity and sanctuary. Escalation is driven entirely by his agency, with coincidence (fog, diner meeting) complicating but never resolving the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing monochrome possession—is signaled early and tightens via Alistair’s escalating rhetorical pressure. His agency drives escalation: each question narrows the entity’s logical escape routes until “truth” loops back as lie. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the entity retreats not banished but refuted, its worldview collapsed. The “before the possession completes” clock sharpens urgency without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—completing the memory map before dawn/exhaustion—tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure: each added memory raises emotional stakes until the missing “keynote” forces a final dive into childhood optimism. Protagonist agency drives escalation; dawn complicates but doesn’t resolve—he must act *before* light fully arrives. Cost is unmistakable: physical collapse (“lead weight in his arm”) and renunciation of control (“had not conquered time”). The single deepening (finding boundless optimism) narrows options to one final line.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping the loop by confronting trauma—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes the tablet encodes rules, not maps. His agency drives escalation: choosing to relive the memory forecloses evasion. Cost (loss of weightlessness, absorption of despair) is felt but slightly understated in the climax. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—overcoming emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens via the inverted song’s physical transmission. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the broken needle, backward playback, and live demonstration. Cost is felt in the audience’s tears and her own reconfigured relationship to silence. One meaningful tightening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving integrity through truth-seeking—is signaled early and deepens when external chaos invades Elias’s ordered world. The tightening occurs when he recognizes the data as a map, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is felt in his shift from refuge to mission, though it remains conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is driven by his agency (decoding, recalling subway research), not coincidence—the pigeon complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why a scent triggers unbearable grief—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s experiment. The tightening occurs when the UV lamp reveals “Somniflora,” linking past and present, narrowing his emotional options to confrontation or flight; he chooses the former. Cost is unmistakable: he endures the full weight of memory, trading numbness for sorrow. Agency drives escalation—his deliberate act under the UV beam catalyzes the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the “smudges on the paper” of human experience against cosmic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the Lumin presents its false binary. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he reframes their pattern not as path but as map of consciousness, turning passive observation into active reinterpretation. The cost is unmistakable: he forgoes transcendence and curated peace to remain a solitary poet, bearing the weight of decay and memory. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through density of insight rather than external action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the hush without violating it—tightens when Elara realizes she must “play the wreckage,” not just her violin. Agency drives escalation: her choice to draw a note as “offering” triggers harmonic responses, deepening her understanding of sound as release. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and the emotional weight of inherited silence. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with each arpeggio narrowing her focus to the duet between ruin and remnant.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—crafting a sustainable half-truth—tightens when Kael realizes joy without sorrow is “unsustainable,” forcing him to absorb the cost himself. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his choice to subsume the full memory deepens stakes, narrowing options to either refuse the commission or pay emotionally. The visible price—“cold, dense stone” of sorrow retained—alters tactics by mandating emotional sacrifice. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts from stillness to electric storm to silent resolution, reweighting the stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring unseen contributors—is signaled early via Elias’s dockworker reflections and deepens when Alina reveals David’s ethos. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his research and proposal narrow options from passive admiration to active legacy-building. Cost is felt in Alina’s trembling hands and Elias’s vulnerability. Coincidence (misdelivered envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the grant emerges from earned causality. Slight deduction: the symphony board’s ease feels untested, softening the price of institutional access.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. isolation—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen risks vulnerability by joining the search. His agency drives escalation: his gaze finds what others miss, leading to communal joy and his reciprocal offering. Cost is felt in his sleepless night of labor and the implied surrender of purely personal art. Coincidence (Echo’s tag) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kaelen’s choice to weave mats earns his inclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the giant’s sleep to prevent ruin—is signaled early and tightens when the Chronovore fractures time. Elias’s agency lies in renunciation (not fighting) and creative endurance (borrowing time as artistry). The escalation is driven by his observation and adaptation, not luck. Cost is legible: he risks failure that would wake the giant, and his victory requires surrendering the quest for a physical “place” in favor of understanding silence as origin—a conceptual price paid in worldview shift.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping ambiguous loss—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from measuring void to integrating absence into his life’s geometry. Agency is internal but potent: his choice to invite rather than command shapes the outcome. Cost is visible in the relinquishment of hope for reunion, replaced by a stable, painful order. One minor deduction: escalation leans heavily on atmosphere over tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving irreplaceable memory—is signaled early and escalates via the tape’s “frantic energy.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to retrieve, interpret, and deliver the fragment despite personal risk of exposure. Cost is legible in Anya’s despair-turned-hope and Elias’s enduring invisibility. Coincidence (the outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the solution stems from Elias’s unique ability and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity through control—is signaled early and tightened when the trellis snaps, foreclosing restoration. Elias’s agency drives escalation: failed repair → observation of leaf → decision to clear wreckage. Cost is felt: retirement feels like betrayal, yet he releases it. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via pattern break—the vine’s yielding contradicts his rigidity, reweighting his options without coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—extracting meaning from a ruined world—is signaled early and deepens when the brooch delivers not just an object but a narrative. The tightening occurs at the exchange: Elias trades possession for story, narrowing his artistic path from abstraction to portraiture. Cost is visible—he walks back as tide turns, rain trails blurring, implying this convergence is fleeting. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (following trails, initiating exchange), though the squall’s role edges toward coincidence; it complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving vs. sharing magic—tightens when Kael’s arrival disrupts the cave’s song, rendering Lyra’s gift useless. The deepening comes via overlapping shadows revealing the cave’s desire, forcing Lyra to confront her misaligned purpose. Agency lies in her final choice to step aside; cost is her lost foresight. Escalation is driven by protagonist perception under Accumulative pressure, not external force.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a shattered history through physical fragments—is signaled early and deepens when the valve connects to a specific tragedy. The escalation is driven by Kaelen’s agency (collecting, curating) and culminates in the woman’s testimony, which transforms an anonymous artifact into a vessel of failed heroism. Cost is felt: the silenced horn, the exile’s weariness, the city’s fragility. Though coincidence brings the woman, her recognition is earned by Kaelen’s consistent practice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the fortress to understand his mentor—is clear early and tightens at the brick wall (first lock). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he reads cracks, uses the punch, steps through. The deepening occurs when the vault reveals truths, redefining the stake from discovery to responsibility. Cost is felt in the mentor’s sacrifice and Elias’s irreversible commitment, though the price lacks physical or social specificity beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring his grandmother’s wish while reconciling his skepticism—is signaled early and tightens when the storm forces a choice: abandon or transcribe. The deepening occurs when he connects whale song to celestial navigation, narrowing options to one act. Cost is emotional: surrendering his identity as a “bedrock facts” man. Coincidence (storm clarifying whale song) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he must still interpret.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping immortality’s curse—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Xylos weaves the storm into reality-warping threads. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he manipulates magnetic fields, provokes spatial mutiny, and snaps the amulet’s leash. Cost is unmistakable—the weight of every lived moment floods him, yet he proceeds. The solar storm’s intensification narrows his window, raising urgency without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—balancing cosmic debt through a “fair trade”—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses forgery over honesty, narrowing her moral path. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: she designs the breach, executes the simulation, signs with “The Ghost.” Cost is unmistakable: she commits her first profound dishonesty, violating her core identity to achieve justice. The tightening—from contemplation to action to silent aftermath—reweights the entire premise under coherent, self-imposed pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving texture against silence—is signaled early and tightens at dawn when sunlight refracts the lamp’s hum, forcing Elara’s decisive transcription. Agency lies in attention and endurance; her choice to translate non-memory into data forecloses passive grief. Cost is felt in the “immense and growing quiet” she battles, though the escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a past through stolen stories—tightens when the woman’s violet grief forces a deeper synthesis, narrowing options to fragile, temporary constructions. Agency lies in selection and layering; each act forecloses permanence but accrues emotional cost (e.g., the label’s phantom history vanishes at high tide). Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, aligning with the Accumulative lens, and the horn’s blast enacts irreversible dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding Thorne’s “ephemeral compass”—is signaled early and deepens when the resonant hum aligns with the seashell, narrowing options to a single patch of floor. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: tuning, bowing, pressing shell to wood. Cost is unmistakable in the climax: no public triumph, only “quiet, perfect, and utterly personal confirmation.” The tightening forecloses myth-busting as a path, reweighting significance itself.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through reorganization—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector arrives early, forcing improvisation. Kael’s agency drives escalation: his graffiti-ledger idea narrows options (no violent revolt) and deepens stakes (failure means erasure). Cost is unmistakable: the Revel’s anarchic soul is partially sacrificed for coherence. Coincidence (early inspector) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from Kael’s embedded system.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—photographing the last bloom—is signaled early and tightens as night deepens and sunrise approaches. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the old method, waits, and captures the moment. The cost is felt in melancholy and irreversible loss, not physical danger. While pressure coheres beautifully, the absence of a tangible opposing force or complicating variable slightly softens the escalation’s bite—luck doesn’t interfere, but neither does resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repairing the drone before dawn—is signaled early and tightens with each horn blast. Agency is clear: Elara’s tactile diagnosis and patch foreclose failure paths. Cost is unmistakable: time scarcity, physical precision under duress, emotional burden absorbed silently. Escalation is protagonist-driven; coincidence (harbor horns) complicates but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the origin of all rivers—is signaled early and deepens into witnessing a planetary event. Pressure escalates via atmospheric drop, falcon’s return, and the ice-map’s emergence, each narrowing options. Elias’s agency drives the climax: he chooses observation over intervention, becoming archivist rather than discoverer. Cost is conceptual (his life’s work reframed as folly) and felt (isolation in the humming dark).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the town’s resonant frequency—is signaled early and deepens as ghostly echoes emerge. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary steps to murmuring crowds of sound, tightening the possibility of failure (if rhythm falters, revival stalls). The cost is felt stamina and irreversible commitment; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful intensification—the baker’s apparition—validates the method and raises emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the hush—intensifies as oxygen depletes, forcing a trade-off: abort (live) or persist (die with purpose). The tightening occurs when the hush “lunges,” transforming abstract mission into visceral battle against ancestral trauma. Protagonist agency drives escalation: overriding instinct to isolate the priestess’s memory reweights all prior effort. Cost is unmistakable—life support failure—and visible in the vial’s glow, now a companion for dying, not a trophy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming a true story against inherited lies—is signaled early and deepens when the tableau forces confrontation with real sin vs. paternal fiction. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to peer, then break the seal). Cost is felt: his truth becomes another “lie” in others’ eyes. One tightening suffices—a single, irreversible act that reconfigures his relationship to legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repaying a cross-lifetime debt through alchemical legacy—is signaled early and deepens via the ghost bride’s “lovingly venomous” influence. Elian’s agency drives escalation: handling the bead, enduring toxic care, recognizing Lyra. The tightening occurs when the Night Phalaenopsis buds, forcing confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: Lyra’s release requires her erasure; Elian gains knowledge but inherits eternal solitude. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each cameo intensifies until bloom-time payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving fragile hope against total erasure—is signaled early and escalates organically: first through dream-stitching, then communal participation, finally the storm’s existential threat. Kaelen’s agency drives the climax; he chooses to reinforce the threads with waking skill, paying a physical price that alters the outcome. The cost is unmistakable: blood, exhaustion, and the near-loss of everything. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, tightening into a single, resonant act of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith through physical contact with lineage—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial’s discovery reframes the quest. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her method of “purposeful wandering” leads to discovery, then reconstruction. Cost is felt in her initial hollowness and the painstaking labor; the final image shows emotional cost transformed, not erased. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—insight emerges from deliberate action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transmitting a fabricated identity undetected—is signaled early and escalates through analog ingenuity. The tightening occurs when Kaelen chooses sidewalk chalk over digital channels, accepting slowness and exposure for secrecy. Cost is conceptual (trust in a broken system) and felt (kneeling on rough concrete), but no live option is foreclosed—his success is assumed, not jeopardized. Agency is clear, yet pressure remains internalized; the sanitation drone hints at surveillance but never threatens, softening the stakes’ visceral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preventing a coup through subterfuge—is signaled early and tightens via Elara’s synthesis of fragments into actionable intelligence. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: interpreting anomalies, encoding data, exploiting telescope protocol. The three-minute channel isn’t luck—it’s a narrow tactical window she seizes with precision. Cost is unmistakable: she risks everything while appearing harmless, and the ending offers no safety, only the echo of a story cast into the void.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding the genesis of regret—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritual. The tightening occurs when words form in condensation, forcing Kael to confront not just memory but motive (“a fear of drowning”). Agency lies in Elara’s fierce tenderness: she chooses to evoke despite personal cost. The price—her energy spent, body swaying—is visible and shapes the ending’s poise. No coincidence resolves; truth emerges through disciplined craft under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating shared human pain across enemy lines—is signaled early and deepens via the cast’s symbols. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decryption reframes the conflict from strategic to emotional. The cost is visible in the General’s swallowed emotion and gentle touch—a foreclosed path of hardened command. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it’s masterfully executed under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and deepens when the memory proves incomplete, raising emotional cost. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: frustration nearly washes out the image, but his choice to incorporate the fragment creates a decisive intensification. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory density and the fragility of light-as-medium—the core concept dictates that desperation destroys the image, forcing restraint. Cost is felt: the mural vanishes, leaving only an echo, affirming joy’s transience as both loss and gift.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s deliberate sound experiments that narrow reality-options. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each nickel flick reconfigures the garden, raising conceptual stakes (skeletal landscapes → blossoming trees → open eyes). Cost is unmistakable: loss of craft’s predictability, crystallized when he rejects cerulean. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens through earned sonic mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving untaxable thought—is signaled early and escalates coherently via protagonist agency: Kaelen chooses to “scream” rather than whisper. The deepening (“they’re learning to read the roots”) forces a trade-off with catastrophic potential. Cost is unmistakable: possible mass cognitive erasure for a moment of freedom. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from metabolizing sorrow to embracing “reef-shadow joy.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she stops hiding poems, a choice that narrows her prior path of concealment. Though agency is internal, the cost is felt: exposure replaces insulation. Coincidence (twin moons) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn stems from her sustained attention to the postcard, aligning with Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving Simple Trust before it vanishes—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Elian must hum the correct fractured note, a task requiring memory, breath, and emotional vulnerability. The tightening occurs when he “chases the spectral harmony,” narrowing options to one fragile pitch. Cost is unmistakable: success archives the feeling but confirms its death below—the “foxglove regret” is both thematic and visceral. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidence or off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (restoring trust before paths diverge) tightens via Kaelen’s irreversible act: modifying Proto-Aenic risks self-shattering, raising cost beyond mere apology. Agency is total—he chooses each vow, knowing failure means ruin. The deepening occurs when Elara enters: his silence now depends on her interpretation, shifting from creation to reception. Cost is unmistakable—the emptied inkwell, his exposed vulnerability, and the ever-present threat of spell-failure crystallize what’s forfeited if she rejects him.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding paternal silence—is signaled early and tightens when the envelope reveals it’s a map, not a letter. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to interpret glue, retrieve the chain, follow calibrations. Cost is felt in the orphan-fear revelation and the reframing of his entire childhood. The lone tightening (pollen → chain → cavity) forecloses his old belief with irreversible emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving Lena’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when the storm threatens physical loss. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to protect the scores, then chooses to share them. The meaningful tightening occurs when Anna steadies the stool, catalyzing his shift from preservation-as-isolation to preservation-as-gift. Cost is felt in his raw confession and the relinquishing of control over Lena’s legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and tightens when Elian deciphers the spacial sheer symbol, narrowing his path to one irreversible crossing. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his decoding of light sequences directly shapes tactics. The cost is unmistakable: passage means permanent separation, foreclosing return. This deepening under Accumulative lens transforms abstract curiosity into existential commitment with resonant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—proving the city is alive—is signaled early and deepens when Elara’s engineering pragmatism clashes with Kaelen’s poetic observation. The escalation is driven by Kaelen’s agency: his mapping of geothermal rhythms culminates in the jellyfish display, forcing Elara’s stance shift. Cost is legible in their shared breath—a surrender of defensive isolation—but the resolution leans slightly on wonder over tangible sacrifice. Coincidence (jellies arriving precisely on cue) complicates believability, though it’s mitigated by prior pattern-establishment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering a story before it fades—tightens via receding vines and flickering turquoise. Kael’s agency drives escalation: conjecture replaces passive observation, culminating in the decisive press of glass to quartz. Cost is visible (nearly lost memory) and conceptual (risk of misreading resolve as tragedy). The deepening—from interruption to destination—narrows interpretive options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming monotony into fleeting beauty—is signaled early and deepened through Kael’s meticulous interventions. Escalation is driven entirely by his agency: each micro-choice (altering water flow, adding precise weight) tightens the system toward collapse. Cost is felt in the quiet solitude of his work and the transience of the result—beauty exists only for those “paying attention.” Coincidence (tide, wave strike) complicates but never resolves; Kael’s design harnesses chaos, never relies on it.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory through creation—is signaled early and tightens when the dance initially fails. Protagonist agency drives escalation: shifting focus from stars to inter-beat voids earns the breakthrough. Cost is legible in exile’s loneliness and the “frustrating whisper” of failed connection. No coincidence; pressure accumulates texturally under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a changing world—is signaled early and tightens when Silas realizes the atrium is built for a past world. The stone-skipping act is a self-driven deepening that reweights options, leading to renunciation. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual but undeniable in the final image. One meaningful intensification suffices, though escalation leans slightly more reflective than active.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—what survival costs—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s recounting of the fire. The meaningful tightening occurs in the flashback’s split-second choice: shielding the girl *and* the box, knowing one will break. This agency-driven escalation forecloses innocence permanently. Cost is felt in scar tissue, silence, and the box’s irreparable state—all visible, tactile, and thematically fused.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing a dying timeline—is signaled early and deepens when the needle plunges, forcing Elara to confront miscalculation. Agency is clear: her pattern design choices directly cause the gauge’s response. Escalation is driven by protagonist action (launching the balloon/pattern) under Accumulative pressure—the tide’s return intensifies stakes without coincidence. Cost is felt in the abandoned, scattered materials and the irreversible expenditure of her equation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to erased guilt—tightens when Elara deciphers the Prometheus formula, transforming passive charting into active moral reckoning. Her agency lies in renunciation: she chooses not to extract or expose, accepting the cost of carrying only the echo, not the evidence. Pressure escalates through textual fragmentation and sonic anxiety, culminating in the realization that the “seed of hope” was atmospheric contagion. The single deepening—scientific ambition curdling into catastrophe—reweights all prior silence with dread.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—planting “seeds of light” to awaken dormant dreams—is signaled early and deepens as each mirror vision reveals personalized hope. Agency lies in his ritualized performance; escalation occurs through accumulating resonance across the city. Cost is felt: he expends the “borrowed heartbeat,” left with only his own pulse—a quiet depletion that forecloses personal gain for communal uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ending the Forever War—is signaled early and deepened by Elias’s realization that reason is dead; only ritualized humility can work. The meaningful tightening occurs when he abandons words for dust-traced sigils, narrowing tactics to embodied symbolism. Cost is felt in the generals’ physical tension and ultimate surrender—laying down the “tool that has defined you.” Pressure remains coherent under the Situational lens: celestial timing and shared exhaustion force crystallization, not luck or external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—atonement through symbolic return—is signaled early and deepens when Elias rejects resurrection for dissolution, narrowing his goal from restoration to echo. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses the basin, retrieves the egg, and initiates release. Cost is unmistakable: “hollow resonance,” the surrender of any hope for birdsong, and the acceptance that his world remains sterile. The thunder’s return underscores that his manufactured drought—and its consequences—endure, making the price conceptual and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity by returning buried truths—is signaled early and deepens through the echo harvest. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each patron’s residue adds psychic weight until the judge’s regret becomes the keystone. Elara’s agency drives the climax; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is unmistakable: years of carrying sorrow culminate in a single, exhausting rite. The tightening forecloses her role as silent keeper, replacing it with active liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—narrative responsibility—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s reflection on audience impact. The meaningful tightening occurs when he questions whether his art “reinforced despair,” narrowing his options from pure subversion to responsive complication. Agency drives escalation: his decision to perform a counter-show arises from internal reckoning, not coincidence. Cost is felt conceptually (loss of artistic purity) and emotionally (isolation, doubt).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to extinction—is signaled early and tightens as butterflies arrive sparsely, forcing Elias to accelerate his work. Agency is clear: his knots and arches are active commemorations, not passive observation. Cost is felt in the “faltering beat” made visible and the irreversible silence after the last butterfly departs. Pressure escalates texturally under the Accumulative lens, not causally, which is appropriate and masterfully handled.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when Elian chooses light over sound, accepting irrevocable loss. The tightening occurs in his shift from restoration to translation: he forecloses the possibility of hearing Lyra’s voice to instead give her name architectural form. Cost is felt in the quiet sea of fulfillment that follows—not triumph, but resignation made luminous. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving/transcending the directive—is signaled early and tightens when the storm breaches the bunker, forcing Kael’s hand. His agency drives escalation: dreams yield insight, leading to the risky act of ingesting the seal. Cost is unmistakable: physical ruin, ancestral legacy lost, yet transcended. The “precisely playful” visions narrow options by reframing the seal not as lock but invitation, making brute force unthinkable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—glimpsing the unknown through mathematical purity—is signaled early and tightens when Kavi risks his life’s work on a silent ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each precise movement (drawing lines, placing tile) narrows options toward irreversible commitment. Cost is unmistakable: he gains transcendent knowledge but must erase all evidence, ensuring solitude. Coincidence never resolves; planetary alignment is a window he exploits, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—convincing Vale to release resentment—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s increasingly intimate intrusions into Vale’s memory. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara narrows transmission to the betrayal instant, forcing Vale to choose cure or collapse. Cost is unmistakable: the sanctuary tears, reality contorts, and Elara risks dissolution. Agency is Elara’s throughout; resolution stems from her persistent, non-coercive pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses breath over repair, presence over science. The deepening occurs in the shift from retrieval to recreation, narrowing options to one fragile act. Agency drives escalation: her synchronized breathing is the sole engine of change. Cost is unmistakable—the vision lasts three breaths, then shatters, yet she accepts this transience as victory.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving legacy versus enabling change—is signaled early and deepens when Elian realizes his mending paradigm is the problem. The meaningful tightening occurs when traditional tools fail, forcing improvisation with the ribbon and seed. Agency drives escalation: his choice to plant the seed (not seal the crack) alters the Heartwood’s fate. Cost is felt in his relinquished authority and the emotional vulnerability of leaving Lyra’s ribbon behind—a tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding vs. obedience—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen disobeys by inquiring. His agency drives escalation: choosing to pocket, examine, and finally comprehend the shell. The cost is conceptual yet visceral—“brightened disquiet” sharpened into “terrifying loop”—and forecloses his prior state of passive maintenance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving tomorrow by unearthing unlearned lessons—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must renegotiate with the Curators. Her agency drives escalation: gap-research → diary decoding → confrontation. Cost is visible in her terror and the implied risk of failure (“future burns”). However, the Curators’ shift feels slightly swift; a beat showing their resistance deepening would heighten pressure without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recapturing her brother’s identity—is signaled early and tightens with each swatch use, culminating in the Ocean’s Heart press that forces irreversible knowledge. Agency is consistent: Elara chooses each shade, each contact point, driving escalation through her own method. The cost is unmistakable: “memories felt like watercolor paintings left in the rain,” and post-climax, her past feels “thin, brittle.” The timeframe accelerates pressure (“watercolor... bleeding”), narrowing options until only memorial-building remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving order through integration, not banishment—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the seal matches the etching. His agency drives escalation: he chooses retrieval, then reweaving, accepting the cost of binding stillborn histories into working time. The deepening occurs when he understands the university sits on a seam; this knowledge forces the ceremonial act. Coincidence complicates (the door appears), but resolution stems wholly from his expertise and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving inner/outer harmony against invasive dissonance—is signaled immediately and tightens when Kaelen risks failure by extracting new ice under amplified hum. His agency drives escalation: choosing *this* ice sheet, internalizing its pattern, and releasing it into the stone. Cost is unmistakable: physical collapse, environmental tremors, and the irreversible commitment to stillness over combat. Coincidence never resolves; victory emerges solely from his precise, ancient method.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving cosmic design over randomness—is signaled early and tightens at the climax when Elian nearly renounces hope. Agency drives escalation: his star-path calculations narrow options until only one alignment remains. Cost is unmistakable: enduring generational silence to test a fragile theory. Coincidence complicates (shards mirror star-lanes) but resolution stems from his steadfastness, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from memory—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes identity was built on erasure. His agency drives escalation: conjecture → measurement → revelation. The tightening forecloses truth-telling; cost is visible in his renunciation. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with storm energy amplifying trauma echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and tightens when Kael shifts from passive listening to active pattern-tracing after finding the knot. The escalation is driven by his agency: applying the knot’s logic to the wall’s flora creates the blueprint. Cost is visible in his initial discouragement and the implied exhaustion of hours walking fruitlessly. Coincidence (finding the knot) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his insight stems from disciplined perception.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving connection through change—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s refusal of melodrama. The tightening occurs when she rejects direct confrontation for tangential observation, narrowing emotional tactics to her lived method. Cost is felt in the “heartache of his departure” as necessary fracture, not loss. Agency is internal but decisive: her attention forecloses despair, affirming life’s “relentless, forward momentum.”

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from suffocating safety—is signaled early and deepens when Elian risks exposure to reach the trellis. The ascent is a battle against instinct, raising emotional cost, and gravity’s return forces renunciation of the infinite. Though coincidence (inversion hour) enables the journey, it’s established as world rule, not deus ex machina; agency lies in Elian’s choice to ascend despite terror.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting the terror of silence—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s guided attention, which narrows the woman’s options from panic to perception. His agency drives escalation: each pointed sound (“light striking prism edges,” “ghost of the train”) forecloses her old way of listening. Cost is felt in her unclenched hands and altered voice—she pays with vulnerability to gain peace. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution; the quiet itself is both antagonist and sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent System Purge—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the sunrise clock. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her historical knowledge enables the sonic key, then guides meticulous peeling under time pressure. Each layer removed forecloses false solutions, narrowing options to the Heartstone shard. Cost is visible in bleeding time and the weight of ancestral failures.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—teaching a suffocating soul to breathe—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s porous “boundary” and Liam’s “rhythm of days.” Her agency drives escalation: “encroach” isn’t passive hope but active pressure via scar-linking. Cost is unmistakable: her isolation persists (“ashes lay undisturbed”), yet she pays it willingly for his single breath. The deepening (“threshold became a conduit”) forecloses easy reconciliation while affirming fragile connection.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating pressure into worth—is signaled early and tightens when the Quantum Promise manifests. Elara’s agency drives escalation: volunteering, lying, then screwing the bolt into chaos. Cost is felt in her guttural cry and past trauma, though the overseers’ panic slightly dilutes external pressure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the glitchy texts enable but don’t dictate her solution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why her lineage ended—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s insistent cranking, which escalates physical and psychic pressure. The tightening occurs when vibration becomes unbearable, forcing the ancestral memory to surface. Agency drives escalation: her turning *causes* the revelation. Cost is clear: the family traded influence for safety, and Elara inherits that quiet freedom—not as loss, but as hard-won peace.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving nascent possibility—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kaelen must sever his clasp-tether at the exact cosmic alignment. This choice narrows options to one razor-thin moment (“Now.”), forcing trade-off: personal connection for universal coherence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—his dance weaves stability against the greenhouse’s chaotic resistance. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the relic-program and his symbiotic anchor, paid precisely when stakes peak.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile human connections against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses to officially reunite button and message, altering archival protocol. This act carries visible cost: she invests time, ritual, and emotional labor into a system designed to anonymize. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (her curiosity → discovery → transcription), not coincidence. While the tightening is profound, it’s singular; a second meaningful constraint (e.g., institutional resistance) would push this higher, but the single deepening suffices for scale.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—holding the line against historical erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s journey. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing alleyways, reading puddle-maps, activating the booth. The tightening occurs when she reaches the lagoon, foreclosing retreat. Cost is felt in her vulnerability and the irreversible broadcast—a crack in apathy that cannot be undone.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving silence against encoded prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when coded drips coalesce. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses negative-space playing, which directly starves the prophecy’s resonance. Cost is visible in his “lonely vigil” and “sorrowful beauty,” and the foreclosed path (a dawn of “fractured light”) lingers as conceptual loss. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the stakes’ metaphysical scale risks abstraction without the saxophone’s physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the message—is clear early and tightens when the anomalous leaf appears. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to build the spire, then to prod. The cost is conceptual (end of hush, irreversible awakening) and felt (“weight of the prophecy”). Coincidence introduces the leaf, but resolution stems wholly from Elian’s action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must improvise the compass pivot, foreclosing mechanical certainty. His agency drives escalation: each collected cog narrows possibility until the final act of balancing the rose. Cost is visible in his relinquishment of control, crystallized in the cavern’s “unpredictable map of light.” Coincidence complicates (the cogs’ appearance) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redeeming failure through understanding—is signaled early and deepens via alchemical escalation. Kael’s agency drives every turn: stoking the furnace, drawing the circle, balancing reagents. The meaningful tightening occurs when he risks shattering the vessel by modulating grief and joy. Cost is unmistakable: his drained energy and the irreversible transformation of the coin, which forecloses literal return but enables emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—completing the spirit’s unfinished music through joy, not just sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when Silas risks intensifying her pain by invoking laughter. Agency drives escalation: his choice to press the tooth to his temple filters anguish into guidance, narrowing options to one path. Cost is unmistakable: the spirit must surrender her fixation on silence to embrace imperfect memory. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Silas’s methodical pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving mercy is computable—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen realizes he’s the variable, not the subject. Pressure escalates through bodily-triggered memories that narrow options: each step risks retraumatization yet yields data. The deepening occurs at the clearing, where endurance replaces resistance. Cost is felt in cellular vibration and psychological reorientation, though the antagonist remains off-page; tension relies on internalized institutional voice, which slightly softens external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased history—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals the *St. Elmo*. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to unfasten the lie exacts emotional cost (wrenching pull, ghost-hand focus). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves. The deepening (false seascape → true wreck) narrows options to one irrevocable act. Cost is unmistakable: the crew’s peace requires the narrator’s labor and the town’s secret laid bare.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to engage with the hidden—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost appears. The meaningful tightening occurs at the ladder: Leo chooses to act despite knowing the cost (emotional entanglement, time, risk). Agency is clear: his observational skill leads to discovery, and his ascent is a renunciation of detachment. The cost is felt in the ghost’s release and Leo’s silent bearing of the barrel—a trade of peace for burden, earned through his own choice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—overthrowing static perfection for dynamic potential—is signaled early and deepens when the whisper’s release triggers systemic overload. The Operator’s agency drives escalation: uncorking, tracing frost, waiting. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s dissolution and loss of curated order. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, tightening via sensory and symbolic density until the rupture reweights everything. No coincidence; every turn stems from the Operator’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating the First Ones as poets, not tyrants—is signaled early and deepens during the squall, when the shard reveals intimate, non-tyrannical acts. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Kaelen chooses to leave the shard exposed, enabling the vision. Cost is unmistakable—his scholarly reputation hangs on interpreting “fantasy” as proof—and the tightening forecloses Valerius’s sterile narrative. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the world’s truthful pitch—is signaled early and tightens when doubt dims the chip, nearly collapsing the effort. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his slip introduces crisis, his refocusing enables recovery. The cost is visible in the chip’s pallor and the faltering hum, and the final act carries irreversible weight—the world’s song returns, but only because he endured the lie. Pressure coheres causally: each adjustment raises stakes, culminating in a single twist that reweights reality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching “the place where explanations fail”—is signaled early and deepens when the compass redirects her. Pressure escalates through environmental and cognitive narrowing: magnetic interference vanishes, then returns underground, forcing Elara to abandon instrumentation for psychometry. Her agency drives every turn, and the cost—renouncing her life’s method of cataloging—is felt in her empty hands and quiet exit. The factory’s closure isn’t coincidence but the necessary condition that enables discovery, aligning perfectly with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with the shore’s living memory—is signaled early and tightens when the wave threatens annihilation. Elara’s agency drives the climax: she acts on the slide’s instruction, trading safety for stewardship. Cost is visible (soaked, trembling) and conceptual (abandoning solitary art for communal pact). Coincidence introduces the slide but doesn’t resolve; her hands do.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal bloom—is signaled early and tightens via the snow-melt clock. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses dawning hush, brings tools, tests filters. Cost is visible in time spent, physical return at night, and emotional shift from solitary search to ancestral connection. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; revelation stems from persistent method.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Elara’s truth—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen abandons inquiry for legacy-building. The escalation is protagonist-driven: his new arrangement forces the figure’s first response. Cost is felt in his “despair” and physical toll, though the price lacks explicit material consequence (e.g., lost time isn’t dramatized beyond summary). Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving the cove through authentic memory—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: each memory fragment exacts physical and emotional toll, narrowing Kaelen’s capacity while deepening his resolve. Agency is clear: he chooses specificity over ease, endurance over despair. Cost is unmistakable (“strain… physical weight,” “profound exhaustion”) and escalates with each lantern lit. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional truth versus surviving existential threat—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the prophecy reveals the archive as lure. Elian’s immersion act deepens knowledge and narrows options: feeling must be starved. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (his choice to test the shaving), and the cost—abandoning his oath—is felt in the final paragraph. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; causality flows from his method and the city’s emotional richness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving legacy through understanding—is signaled by line 2 and deepens when Elara realizes time’s texture is collective memory. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses invitation over force, narrowing tactics to ancestral method. Cost is felt in the dissolving memories and crystallized in the final “wild serenity,” where peace carries the weight of all that was nearly lost. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—listening vs. silencing—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elian diverts siren power into the mountain’s core, foreclosing compliance. Escalation is driven by his agency under Accumulative pressure: data patterns → harmonic conviction → rope discovery → override patch → final pull. Cost is unmistakable: he trades institutional safety for cosmic communion, dramatized in the switch-throw and rope-pull. Coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elian’s choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—finding strength through vulnerable connection—is signaled early and deepens when Kael chooses empathy over detachment during the Perseid descent. This single, decisive intensification narrows his options: he can no longer observe dispassionately. The cost is felt immediately in shared terror and glory, and crystallizes in his transformed relationship to cosmic dust. Agency lies in attention itself, and the escalation is driven entirely by his choice to “open himself,” not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing Lyra from the covenant of silence—is signaled early and tightens when she points to the box. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decision to unearth and open the box forecloses his solitary vigil. Cost is unmistakable: “he had only built a prettier cage” reveals his decade-long error, and release requires relinquishing control over their memory. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—ghosts’ swirling energy intensifies until the box’s luminescence stills them.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when Kael’s “garage sale” method yields the glass-shard message, narrowing his options to one decisive act. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his poetic lures attract the exact resonance he needs. Cost is legible in the closing lines—his personal decay halts not through victory but surrender to another’s finished life. Coincidence (the traveler’s note) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael still must choose to press the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming fragmented loss into beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the kite snaps, forcing Kaelen to “tend to its aftermath.” His agency lies in attention: scanning sand, braiding discordant notes (kite’s dance + feather’s stillness). Cost is felt—the child’s “sharp cry,” his own ache—but the escalation hinges on external coincidence (kite snap), not protagonist-driven pressure. Still, the deepening reweights stakes via his perceptual shift toward “grace of letting go.”

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bridging carbon/silicon life—is signaled early and tightens as Elias’s body fails, forcing accelerated completion. His agency drives escalation: each wrapped branch narrows time while deepening commitment. The final wire insertion isn’t luck but culmination of diary-guided labor, with cost felt in his collapse. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via copper-web density until the hum reconfigures stakes from coexistence to symbiosis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled early and deepens when Aris confronts the mandala of footprints, forcing a renunciation of isolation. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens: each sensory beat and sculpture tightens focus until convergence becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in his silent surrender of the amber, though the escalation lacks a second high-pressure choice beyond arrival and placement.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield—is signaled early and tightens through the birds’ guidance: each call narrows seed choice (“Cliff-Thistle” for rock, “Ghost-Lily” for memory). Agency is clear (heeding cries, pressing seeds), and cost is visible in his aching back and depleted satchel. Pressure escalates texturally via intensifying bird chorus, though the lack of tangible setback slightly softens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bridging past/present through relics—tightens when static reveals no voice, forcing Elara to reinterpret the cylinder as text. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to scrape grooves (not wait for sound) enables Barrow’s directional cues. Cost is legible in the journey’s physical toll and the despair at the fissure (“looked like nothing”) before revelation. Coincidence never resolves; Barrow’s skills are established early as cadaver-dog intuition repurposed for ecological clues.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding orientation in temporal chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the pulsar’s light behaves anomalously, forcing Elara’s hand to draw not stars but distortions. The “glimpse” is protagonist-driven (she locks eyes with the vortex) and carries cost: she forfeits the old model of time. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via sensory density (“syrupy waves,” “tide pool” time) until the crystalline vision reconfigures stakes. Coincidence never resolves; agency lies in her interpretive act.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—freeing a captured paradox to restore cosmic balance—is signaled early and deepens when Kael chooses amendment over theft. The meaningful tightening occurs when he uses light, not force, to distract Sylas, narrowing his own margin for error. Cost is visible: Kael foregoes possession, planting hope instead. While stakes remain slightly abstract (“celestial clock”), they’re grounded through the bone king’s “cold weight” and the seed’s “warm light,” making the moral calculus tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus control—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s riskier walks. Escalation is driven by her agency: from S-E-C-R-E-T to R-E-L-E-A-S-E to U-N-B-I-N-D, each step narrowing her safety. The Regent’s “benevolent ruthlessness” is tested by real grief, forcing a costly reversal. Price is visible: exposure, emotional rupture, and the unbinding that may destabilize her regime.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging through the lost language stone—is signaled early and tightens when the inert stone brings “disappointment felt like a physical weight.” The escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she recalls the feather method and ascends to the aviary. Cost is unmistakable: days of despair, the near-collapse of her “fragile peace,” and the surrender of escapist dreams. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through sensory and emotional density until the stone’s resonance reconfigures her reality.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through confronting a fatal mistake—is signaled early and escalates via Elias’s methodical winnowing of memory. The tightening occurs when he shifts from admiring the tapestry’s serene center to studying its chaotic border, narrowing his focus to the exact threads representing his errors. His agency drives escalation: each decoded thread alters his understanding, culminating in the simple defensive move he’d dismissed. Cost is unmistakable: the prince’s life lost to pride, now transmuted into Elias’s hard-won wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether truth must be singular to earn peace—is clear from the first paragraph and tightens relentlessly. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each whispered line tests the Warden-enforced silence, culminating in a final act that weaponizes the canyon’s acoustics. Cost is unmistakable: her freedom for proliferating doubt. The horn’s moan raises pressure without resolving it; climax stems wholly from her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—narrating truth against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when Elara’s uncertainty poisons her intent mid-ritual, nearly collapsing the spell. The leviathan’s shadow externalizes stakes without resolving them; agency remains hers. The deepening occurs at the heart-crater: she must choose between factual accuracy and emotional truth, opting for the latter with palpable cost (risking historical falsity). Under an Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though a second tactical consequence (e.g., binder depletion) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring a private promise to preserve love’s memory in beauty—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias abandons the map for instinct, accepting deviation as destiny. Pressure escalates texturally: the narrowing tunnel, fading ocean roar, and sudden openness mirror internal compression and release. The cost is felt in the shell’s irreversible submersion—a tiny, vibrant world surrendered to indifferent stone. Though coincidence (the fissure) complicates, resolution stems from Elias’s agency: he chooses to reveal, then release.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and deepens into a life-or-death test when the *Stellaria* is lost. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he rejects Hemlock’s failed method and risks his own credibility on an unproven, intimate act. The tightening occurs when he chooses pure emotional focus over mechanical signaling, narrowing options to a single, vulnerable channel of intent. Cost is unmistakable: his entire sense of self hinges on this act, and though successful, the victory is quiet, uncelebrated, and isolating—earned stasis with emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost souls home—tightens meaningfully when the full moon amplifies the censer’s power, forcing Elias to act tonight. His agency is clear: he interprets “Serpent’s tooth” and “broken horn,” climbs the gantry, and slots the foot. The cost—enduring his own unresolved loss while aiding others—is felt in his chest and tears. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the neighbor’s question triggers the affliction’s usual compulsion, now blocked by the relic. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he seeks the cure, trades his truffles, performs the occlusion ritual. The cost is unmistakable: he retains privacy but accepts permanent solitude, crystallized in his partial truth. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with one meaningful deepening (the occlusion attempt) that reweights all future interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the gesture—is signaled early and tightens as borrowed memories intensify. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses nightly communion with the flower, narrowing his world to its echoes. The cost is emotional labor and shared haunting, culminating in understanding that forecloses further inquiry. Coincidence (finding the flower) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the insight is earned through persistent attention under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling Elara’s promise before the creek seals the fissure—is signaled early and escalates via the rising water (a live clock). Elias’s agency drives deepening: he follows ant paths, enters the cavern, activates the chip. The meaningful tightening occurs when the doorway appears but must be refused; this crystallizes his stance. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of other lives, making peace contingent on renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape vs. identity—is signaled early and tightens at the pool, where touching the light means erasure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb, reaches toward the pool, then pulls back. Cost is unmistakable: she retains her soul but must endure her gilded cage knowingly. The astrologer’s warning gains weight through dramatization, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing “density of presence”—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s departure makes absence visceral. The tightening occurs in one decisive turn: his whisper forces Elara to choose between sterile perfection and messy truth. Agency drives escalation—she actively pours grief into the sphere—and cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes her lifelong method. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with emotional stakes intensifying through embodied detail, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—integrating a splintered self—is signaled early and tightens when feral nostalgia triggers the flight trance, which narrows options from passive recording to active reconfiguration. The deepening occurs in the aerial perspective, where jealousy dissolves into awe. Cost is legible: the narrator forfeits the illusion of linear time and must accept all selves as one. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—perceiving meaning in absence—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s handling of the screw. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to interpret rather than repair, she forecloses mechanical detachment for emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: she endures the void but gains weight in what remains. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into meaning—is signaled early and deepens when academic methods harden the crystal, forcing a trade-off: abandon logic or endure permanent scarring. Elian’s agency drives escalation; his choice to whisper names isn’t passive but an active redefinition of healing. Cost is unmistakable: the “hard, translucent shell” flakes away only after he risks “foolishness,” sacrificing intellectual pride. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each named scar intensifies the emotional density until release.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—delivering an apology before memory is erased—is signaled early and tightens decisively during the séance, which narrows options to a single, fragile window. Julian’s agency drives the escalation: he pays the fee, places the bottle, speaks the words. The cost is felt in the “raw and agonizing miracle” and the irreversible acceptance that replaces hope of reunion. While coincidence (the orchard’s scheduled destruction) complicates, it doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems entirely from Julian’s vulnerable act under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unifying word and silence—is signaled early and tightens through the spiral walk, culminating in the relinquishment of the dictionary. Agency lies in attention and endurance; the “wanderingly exact” path is both method and pressure. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: loss of self as observer. One meaningful deepening suffices—the warped definition of “arbitration”—which reconfigures all prior conflict as convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—tightens when the discrepancy appears post-whistle, forcing Elias into diagnostic focus. His agency drives escalation: counting ritual, retrieval of key, breath-fogged inspection. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—he must abandon the illusion of mechanical purity. Coincidence (ice forming) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from his methodical attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing, not retrieving, the familiar stranger—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes they seek passage, not intrusion. His agency drives escalation: months of work culminate in a single, high-stakes act with irreversible cost (emotional exhaustion, finality). The “permeable barrier” method forces a trade-off: success means permanent loss. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens—each beat follows from his spatial insight and technical tinkering.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling logic with lived uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens through each subway discovery. Aris’s agency drives escalation: she chooses absurdity over academic safety, narrowing her options with each train ride. The final balcony forces a stance crystallization where risk becomes necessary, not reckless. Cost is felt in her abandoned intellectual fortress, though no tangible loss (time/money) is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming finality into possibility—is signaled early and tightens through Silas’s methodical looping, which narrows the caller’s options from despair to grammatical reorientation. Agency is clear: Silas chooses when to tap the disc, when to repeat, when to affirm. Cost is felt in his enduring isolation, though it remains conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, but the price lacks physical or emotional toll beyond stated estrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten truth against institutional neglect—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses to risk the photograph in chemical bath. The deepening occurs at the jetty: the discovery isn’t just historical but relational, forcing both archivists to confront inherited falsehoods. Cost is felt in the “haunted euphoria” and the absurd weight of “a hundred years of pointless animosity.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (restoration → pilgrimage), though Tomas’s parallel arrival leans slightly on synchronicity, mitigated by his stated research into the “broken pact.”

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—curing apathy through catalyzed connection—is signaled early and tightens when strangers arrive. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he seeds rumors, then chooses dialogue over spectacle. Cost is felt (“still lonely”) but not overstated; the trade-off (myth for mutuality) narrows his path credibly. Coincidence (rumor spread) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is his deliberate outreach at the fire barrel.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating emotional depths through sonic harmony—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: each dowsed note forecloses old grief models (dirge → anthem). Cost is unmistakable: Kaelen sacrifices the myth of silence for harder-won harmony, felt in “sharp edges smoothed.” Escalation follows Accumulative lens: resonance density increases until final chord resolves internal/external discord. Coincidence never resolves; the celestial lull enables but doesn’t gift the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redemption through historical correction—is signaled early and tightened when each edit spawns new disasters, forcing Kaelen to confront the universe’s resistance to human fixes. His agency drives escalation: he actively tests variables, witnesses consequences, and ultimately chooses non-intervention. The cost is legible in his body (hunched → unbent) and psyche (grief transformed into eulogy). Coincidence complicates (anomaly enables access) but doesn’t resolve—he earns his stance through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to forgotten echoes—is signaled immediately and tightens meaningfully at the ferry landing, where silence becomes “aggressive,” forcing Elian’s most desperate, complex signing. His agency drives escalation: each click-and-sign sequence deepens engagement until the final disruption, which carries visible cost (emotional exhaustion, irreversible completion). The “joyful sorrow” tension sharpens the peak choice, and the stakes feel viscerally real through embodied ritual rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing Elara’s erased truth—is signaled early and tightens through each artistic clue until the portrait chamber forces a decisive reconfiguration: creation over destruction. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (deciphering, aligning light), not coincidence. The cost—abandoning cathartic rage for fragile, enduring art—is unmistakable in the final brush reach. One meaningful deepening (vandalism as canvas) suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—breathing life into a dead dream—is signaled early and deepens when the facility’s stillness offers a narrow window for action. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her drumming intensifies from hesitant tap to soul-flight rhythm, narrowing options (she must act now or never) and raising emotional stakes. The cost is unmistakable: the lagoon’s beauty underscores Leo’s absence, making her triumph inseparable from sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the manifest before the storm breaks—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen’s challenge raises personal stakes. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the path via coin, decodes the plate, bypasses brute force. Cost is felt in Kaelen’s lost credibility and Silas’s reaffirmed isolation. The single meaningful deepening (from maintenance task to proof of philosophy) narrows options to quiet competence versus loud failure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—alleviating the canal’s sorrow without domination—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen chooses reflection over extraction. Agency lies in attention: weaving light patterns is a renunciation of control, accepting risk that the darkness might not respond. Cost is felt in the lingering watchfulness; the resolution doesn’t erase sorrow but integrates it. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens: stillness → tremor → plunge → bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving individuality under totalitarian homogeny—is signaled early and escalates via Elias’s clandestine coordination, culminating in the ninth bell’s silent defiance. His agency drives the deepening: he doesn’t wait for change but weaves hope into action. The cost is conceptual but sharp: if caught, annihilation; yet the story wisely avoids physical stakes, trusting the emotional and social price of visibility. One tightening suffices—the shift from resignation to curiosity—but lacks a second tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“freedom vs. safety”) tightens decisively when Elara’s practicality cracks, forcing Kaelen’s hand. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to pour his essence into the scrimshaw, risking loss of land and sister. Cost is unmistakable—Elara’s “fragile plea” and final “aching acceptance” show relational forfeiture. Coincidence never resolves; the whale’s thrum answers only because Kaelen initiates the call.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—surviving grief under a joy mandate—is signaled early and tightens when Elias recalls failing Mara, raising emotional cost. His agency drives escalation: narration shields him, but whittling becomes deeper rebellion, culminating in the bird’s creation—a trade-off between safety and remembrance. The state’s off-page violence (Mara’s arrest) applies coherent pressure without resolving conflict; Elias’s endurance crystallizes under it. Cost is unmistakable: his peace is “not happiness, but… enough,” paid for by guilt and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden truth through aesthetic surrender—is signaled early and tightens when Kael dissolves his identity to “paraphrase” the hum. The deepening occurs mid-story as he abandons translation for porous receptivity, narrowing options to pure resonance. Cost is felt in his post-epiphany shiver—a physical toll for transcending boundaries—and the irreversible shift from observer to co-creator. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the single tightening (self-dissolution) barely meets the 8.8+ gate for visible price in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving Lyra through an impossible barter—is signaled early and tightens when the “perfect sound” demand seems unmeetable. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he interprets the ivy, proposes the reed, arranges flora. Cost is visible in Vex’s despair and Elian’s silent labor. Though the resolution leans on mystical mechanics, the protagonist’s choices narrow options credibly under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the “vital lost frequency”—tightens meaningfully when Elian shifts from hearing to seeing the echo, foreclosing auditory solutions. His agency drives escalation: questioning assumptions leads to apparatus-building, which enables the climax. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of traditional ringing for silent resonance. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each prism-song deepening the thematic weight of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning after profound loss—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s escalating interventions (crane → fox → lotus). His agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. The cost is visible: he risks reopening his wound by repurposing Anya’s stencil, and she musters will to step onto the dais. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the woman’s internal struggle could be slightly more active earlier to heighten reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding mass hysteria’s structural logic—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reveals her father’s unfinished work. The tightening occurs when Julian’s personal “why” merges with her systemic inquiry, raising emotional stakes without melodrama. Agency lies in attention and interpretation, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the weight of cyclical human folly, though a more concrete forfeiture (e.g., Elara sacrificing a chance to warn others) would elevate pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge without madness—is signaled early and deepens when Elara discovers the “purify” addendum. Her agency drives escalation: each unpredictable gesture (humming discordant melodies, varying pressure vectors) narrows options by avoiding patterns that would trigger chaos. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her “innocence” and individual identity to host “ghosts,” crystallized in the final sigh of “half-surrender, half-triumph.”

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (“preserve shape of hope”) tightens decisively when Kael realizes deletion would erase Elara’s humanity—forcing integration over excision. Agency drives escalation: his video analysis *creates* the insight that the shadow is self-caged trauma, altering tactics. Cost is felt in the “frost-tinged dawn” revival—hope preserved but irrevocably altered. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from Kael’s choices under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving compassion without self-betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses painstaking reconstruction over vengeance. The meaningful tightening occurs during molting: he discards anger and pride to access his core purpose. Agency is clear: his hands act while his spirit reconfigures. Cost is felt in the lost specimens and shattered trust, yet the chameleon’s acceptance offers a fragile counterweight that reweights the entire emotional economy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether scars can be closed—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the “miracle” displaces into plant telepathy, foreclosing surgical resolution. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to “tunnel” via coffee rings, directly causing the ivy’s panic and his own collapse. Cost is unmistakable: communion withdrawn, truth “offering no peace,” and the meteor hush now “heavier.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory and thematic density.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts focus from Arthur’s heart to the film’s energy path. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes love isn’t stored but absorbed, foreclosing her initial hypothesis with conceptual cost. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens; no coincidence resolves anything—insight emerges from sustained attention. Agency lies in her choice to follow the light, not the man.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity through rest—is signaled immediately and deepens when the meteor reveals “remembered stardust,” transforming noise into cosmic longing. This escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: her tracing ritual precipitates the epiphany, which reconfigures her entire purpose. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons years of seclusion, accepting connection’s vulnerability. The single tightening (meteor event) narrows her path from escape to creative engagement, fulfilling Accumulative lens requirements with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the archive’s fragile peace without betraying its mission—is signaled early and tightens when the forest memory threatens rupture. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: choosing to *interfere* wave functions (“overlap, allowing them to interfere and resonate”) forecloses erasure or surrender. Cost is felt in the body (“violent intrusion”) and conceptually (the old world’s rigidity vs. new synthesis). Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory dissonance until resolution reweights existence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding his role in the forest’s logic—tightens meaningfully when alien chimes signal uncharted syntax, raising the cost of ignorance. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the sound, endure disorientation, and surrender reason to parse patterns. The deepening occurs when the hum of insight shifts from symptom to signal, narrowing options to acceptance or resistance; he chooses integration. Cost is felt as the loss of randomness (comforting chaos replaced by divine responsibility), legible in his changed relationship to the gear.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: each step forward is a defiance of past fear. The meaningful tightening occurs when the guides stop and present the ticket; Elara must choose alone. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the known world of ghosts for an uncertain path, her shadow “long and steady” implying irreversible commitment. Pressure coheres texturally—no false resolutions, no coincidence—and escalates through embodied choices, not external threats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—tightens when Elias realizes escape is betrayal. His agency shifts from passive endurance (“learned to perform silence”) to active offering (the bolt). Pressure escalates via proximity to the soloist and the staircase’s ghost-stain, culminating in a trade-off: risk rupture or remain complicit in mutual silence. Cost is felt in “phantom tingle… like accusation” and the warmth returning only after he acts.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and tightens when Kael retrieves the ink pellet, narrowing options to a single, irreversible act. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: centuries of marginalia culminate in one decisive sundering. Cost is unmistakable: Kael’s existence is spent, and reality itself is stained. The “graceful collapse” reflects stakes scaled to cosmic balance, not brute force.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when the neap tide alarm forces a now-or-never choice. The deepening occurs via Lena’s hidden notation, which reframes the entire quest. Cost is felt in Aris’s isolation and the ephemeral reward; the reef returns but cannot be held. Agency drives escalation: his tapping sequences evolve through failed attempts, culminating in the heartbeat rhythm he alone must supply.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reigniting the rebellion’s spark—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s rejection of brute-force tactics. The meaningful tightening occurs when she substitutes humming for plasma torches, narrowing options to one fragile, resonant method. Cost is felt: months of secret practice, barefoot vulnerability, and the risk of total failure. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a cadence shift (hum → pulse → satellite blink) that reweights hope as active, not passive.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—biological autonomy vs. engineered conformity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s orchestration of algae, ferns, and geothermal resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when she channels the vent’s frequency, irrevocably committing to defiance. Cost is unmistakable: she plants a seed that will fracture the reconstruction’s foundation, risking eradication. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under the Accumulative lens—each whispered command tightens the weave of her insurgency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—anchoring hope in realism—is tested when the drone triggers PTSD. Tightening occurs via bodily betrayal (frozen hand), forcing her to choose between past trauma and present duty. Agency drives escalation: her somatic grounding technique alters tactics mid-crisis. Cost is felt in locked joints and the photograph’s ghostly weight—optimism persists only through active, painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency amid fragmentation—is signaled early and deepens when Elias rejects platitudes (“is it better to have loved and lost?”) and chooses redesign. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each action (thread selection, charcoal use) narrows options toward mapping over repair. Cost is visible (trembling hands, slashed canvases) but could be sharper; the “luminescent ache” softens consequence slightly. Coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency remains central.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and tightens when Kael chooses drone pursuit over rescue. Agency is clear: his decision forecloses communal belonging (cost shown via ignored shouts). Escalation is driven by protagonist action (retrieving ink, reading patterns), not coincidence. Drone complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael’s method creates the turn. Cost is felt in his isolation and the kin’s unaided struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanctioned history vs. revealing contraband truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara learns of the impending purge. Her agency drives escalation: discovery → decryption → broadcast, each narrowing escape routes. Cost is unmistakable: betrayal of vows, exposure to Council retribution, shattering societal stability. The “blink that follows surprise” creates urgent temporal pressure that forces irreversible action without deliberation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—choosing peace amid inherited chaos—is signaled early and tightens when the father’s forgotten knife becomes a live option. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she handles the weapon, feels its weight, then chooses containment over rejection. The cost is unmistakable: she accepts the burden of legacy without yielding to it. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory and symbolic density, not external events, culminating in a decisive renunciation that narrows her future to one of quiet endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens through pattern breaks in celestial order and garden physics. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: his intuition navigates chaos, his calm insulates him, his strike voices silence. Cost is conceptual (enduring cosmic dissolution) and visible (the echo’s dissolution post-manifestation). Coincidence complicates (Lyra’s shockwave) but never resolves; every turn stems from Kaelen’s choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting her father’s hidden truth—is signaled early and tightens through Celeste’s proof-by-contradiction, which narrows Davies’ options until his narrative implodes. Each question she poses forecloses a path: laundering is illogical, greed contradicted by yacht sale, villainy undone by the letter. The escalation is driven entirely by her agency under causal pressure, culminating in a visible price: the brother’s betrayal exposed, the father’s sacrifice confirmed. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—freedom traded for silence, now redeemed only in celestial metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt’s hum—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when Elian chooses to *hush* rather than flee the cry. Agency drives escalation: he uses letters, lullaby, birthdate, and amber to rewire the machine—a sequence of earned micro-choices under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: the cessation of his internal hum equals the acceptance of loss, not its undoing. Coincidence (finding letters) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his ritualized action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning amid societal unlearning—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses sand over speech, foreclosing verbal resolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: silence grows heavier until the mandala offers non-verbal reconnection. Cost is visible in the characters’ listlessness and the fragility of their shared focus—no easy fix, only a starting point. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—relieving suffering by dismantling memory—is clear early and tightens when Kaelen chooses to rename despite personal cost. Escalation is driven by his agency: placing the tessera, initiating the edit, forging “Ren.” The moral calculus (mercy as erasure) sharpens the climax. Cost is felt in Kaelen’s “ghost’s departure” ache and Ren’s emptied selfhood—no off-stage resolution or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and tightens as Julian risks his spectral essence to alter Elara’s trajectory. Escalation is driven by his agency: each echo (sunlight, laughter, scent) deepens pressure until the climactic applause-vibration forces Elara’s stance crystallization. Cost is visible: Julian’s “soul crested and broke” implies depletion, and Elara’s tearless departure shows emotional labor. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Julian’s method is the engine, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating Lena’s connection—is signaled early and deepens through two escalating tests (grief, then love), each narrowing Elias’s options: from dismissal to participation to belief. Protagonist agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. The cost is conceptual (abandoning empiricism) and relational (risking further disappointment), made visible in his strained voice and trembling hope. Pressure coheres under causal lens with one meaningful tightening per test.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving form to the formless—is signaled early and tightens when the sensor fails, forcing Elara to participate rather than observe. Her choice to lower the device and open herself forecloses detached documentation, incurring the cost of irreversible ontological shift. Pressure escalates via emotional residue density, culminating in alien awe that demands surrender. Agency drives deepening; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rewriting prophecy through recovered wisdom—is signaled early and deepens as each button sharpens ancestral voices. Agency is sustained: Kaelen’s cataloging actively untangles doom, narrowing ignorance into clarity. The escalation peaks when the last grain falls, forcing a binary: obey or deliver truth. Cost is unmistakable—he forfeits ritual authority, stepping into unknown consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of voices → coherence → crossroads, all driven by his labor.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—saving the woman whose death he failed to prevent—is signaled early and deepens when Kestrel reveals she’s alive but hunted. The tightening is decisive: Elias now has coordinates but must act alone, foreclosing passivity. Cost is felt in his solitary departure and the vulnerability of the snow map. Agency drives escalation—his presence triggers Kestrel’s message, and his memorization/scuffing shows tactical adaptation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; everything hinges on human choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether the broken promise can be reconciled—is signaled early and deepens when memory surfaces via the needle. The tightening occurs not through external conflict but internal recalibration: Elias realizes the promise evolved into compassion, narrowing his emotional options from guilt to grace. Agency is in attention and reinterpretation; cost is the relinquishing of self-punishment. Under an Accumulative lens, the rhythmic hammering and dripping intensify pressure until silence permits resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether kindness can anchor memory against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen’s act of watering the rose bush triggers the oasis’s response. This escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: his choice forecloses passivity and demands physical labor as price, altering tactics (he abandons camp to rebuild). The cost is legible in the final beat—his exhaustion, the moonrise marking lost time—and the thrum’s subsidence confirms the trade: his effort has woven him into the place’s fabric. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each repaired section intensifying vision and resonance without coincidence or convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bringing light to Henderson’s darkness—is signaled early and deepens through nightly escalation: colder air, dormancy of other plants, her arm as “gentle engine.” The tightening occurs when she shifts from floral offering (rose) to metallic reflection (gauge tooth), narrowing tactics to one fragile, labor-intensive method. Cost is visible in her physical endurance and emotional exposure (“protected vulnerability”). Agency drives escalation: she chooses rhythm, timing, and persistence; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (coexisting with memories vs. isolation-as-cage) tightens when Kael risks the stone circle despite fear of “brittle awakening.” His agency drives escalation: placing the sundial initiates the vision, forcing endurance over flight. Cost is unmistakable—the creatures’ silent presence embodies irreversible loss—but the hum’s anchor prevents collapse. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from “cage” to “reservoir” reweights the entire conflict under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rejoining a fractured world—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the terror of shared vulnerability. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens: each added token (concert ticket, baby shoe) raises emotional stakes, culminating in her decisive contribution. Agency drives escalation—she walks forward, chooses a space, wedges the nest—foreclosing her old path of isolation. Cost is legible: the nest is no longer hers alone, but its purpose is amplified.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing societal collapse via cosmic manipulation—is signaled early and escalates through the town hall collapse. Elara’s agency drives the deepening: her decision to interfere narrows her options (she risks detection or failure) and imposes physical/emotional cost (“exhausted ache”). The pressure coheres causally under the Causal lens, with the tricksters’ arrogance creating a vulnerability she exploits. The cost is unmistakable in her trembling hands and the fragile, hard-won pause in violence below.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost truth against forgetting—is signaled early and deepens as spatial mutiny escalates. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to enter, plays the chord, targets the keystone. Cost is felt in panic, fraying sanity, and physical constriction, lifted only by decisive action. One tightening suffices: the organ’s sound transforms sanctuary into trap, forcing the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy through artistic confrontation with absence—is signaled early and deepens as Elias’s ritual intensifies. The single meaningful tightening occurs when he scratches the canvas, a protagonist-driven act that redefines the portrait’s meaning and exacts emotional cost. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. The stakes feel viscerally real because they’re tied to specific objects, actions, and sensory thresholds.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (restoring Eva’s truth) tightens meaningfully when Elias realizes her exile was quarantine, not punishment—raising personal and professional risk. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to decode, journey, insert the nail, and finally transmit the log. Cost is felt in the “palpable, breathing” dread and implied future backlash, though the story spares us overt consequence. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s interpretation of poetic clues against station data.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping existential “stuckness”—is signaled early via Lyra’s dialogue and crystallizes in Elias’s resolve. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: his observation decodes the mesh, transforming passive solitude into active pursuit. Cost is felt (loss of Lyra, old identity) but could be sharper—what does playing this new song *forfeit*? Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening: the realization that reality is legible as code.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanctuary from erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Innovate Forward arrives. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his territorial markers force the CEO’s confrontation, narrowing options until the startup’s collapse. Cost is unmistakable: he endures isolation to avoid repeating his father’s path. The deepening (“why some paths circle back”) crystallizes into thematic insight with opportunity cost—connection foregone for understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple—is signaled early and deepens when the glyphs reveal themselves as grief, not data. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elian abandons decryption for witnessing, foreclosing the path of solution-oriented obsession. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of familial legacy as puzzle-solving; instead, he accepts it as shared sorrow. Agency is clear: his choice to chronicle, not interpret, drives the climax. Coincidence (the star chart) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight comes through his practiced method.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the frozen confession—is signaled early and deepens when the confession reveals inadequacy rather than betrayal. Pressure escalates through three ritual circles, each narrowing options until the third breaches the vortex at great personal cost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to push deeper despite psychic screams. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the flesh-eating seed is earned backstory, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the dream-intersection—is signaled early and tightens when Kael’s nightmare static warns against a false path. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she rejects oblivion, uses the clipping’s logic, and creates a vector. Cost is visible in the vertigo of linkage and the razor-edge anxiety overcome by elation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her choice does. Lacks a second meaningful deepening, but one suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—patching Elara’s soul—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow threatens the sapling. Aris’s agency drives escalation: he chooses memory over combat, narrowing options to ritual offering. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices a core memory of his own lost future. The void is both antagonist and consequence of his original bargain, making conflict coherent and morally weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure—is signaled early and deepens through the physical struggle with the grille cloth, which becomes a proxy for confronting memory. The escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he chooses to open the box, wrestles the past, and decides where to place the relic. Cost is felt in the collapse of his “fortress of facts” and the vulnerability of keeping the scrap visible. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving their shared belief in an ordered, knowable universe survives death—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from mourning to inquiry. The meaningful tightening occurs when she rejects emotional catharsis for analogical method, narrowing options to scientific ritual. Cost is legible: she endures the “agonizing torment” of near-presence to pursue understanding, and the resolution demands she accept encoded absence over return. Protagonist agency drives escalation—her decision to plant as experiment, not prayer, forces the universe to answer in physics, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid stasis—is signaled early and deepens as Kaelan must accept searing contradictions to smelt memories. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to plunge hands into luminous brine despite pain, embodying “destroy to create.” Cost is unmistakable: loss of Archivist certainty, endurance of raw grief, and cyclical self-fragmentation. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, with tide and moon governing both external and internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—dissolving isolation versus preserving separation—is signaled early and deepens when Elias confronts the pearl’s purpose. The single tightening (choosing to reverse the bunker’s function) narrows options irrevocably, with clear cost: betraying his oath to fulfill his deeper motive. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through sensory and emotional density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through geographic ritual—is signaled early and deepens when the graffiti reframes the quest. The tightening occurs not through external pressure but internal recalibration: Elias shifts from seeking a destination to recognizing his own authorship of suffering. Cost is unmistakable in the relinquished accordion and the acceptance that guilt remains a tributary, not a terminus. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights the entire enterprise.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding unspoken words before the second letter—tightens meaningfully when Elara deciphers “Stay,” which reconfigures the entire emotional manuscript. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she uses the watch’s reverse tick to navigate temporal parallax, each transcription narrowing options toward the core truth. Cost is felt in the frantic heartbeat of the watch and the dissolving library. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; everything stems from her methodical, trust-based navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus imperial myth—is signaled early and tightened when the vine’s memory contradicts scrolls. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to trust plant-memory over sanctioned history, then acts via cutting and reporting. Cost is unmistakable: loss of career, safety, and belonging. The “perforated destiny” isn’t abstract—it manifests as missing stitches in the coffee-stain star chart, directly altering his options and crystallizing his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing life’s essence before dissolution—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification: isolating “unbridled joy” from chaos. Agency manifests as attention and will, not physical action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the soul vanishes entirely, leaving only its curated echo. No false resolutions; the aurora’s gentling confirms stakes were real and met, not circumvented.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—nurturing rebirth without overstepping—is signaled early and deepens when tradition fails. Elara’s agency shifts from passive observer to participant, foreclosing the old way with quiet cost (unlearning non-interference). Pressure escalates organically: dimming light → sluggish water → exposed core. Climax hinges on her choice to intervene, not luck; the grotto’s response validates her earned stance under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (moral certainty vs. doubt) sharpens through protagonist agency: Kaelen’s initial insistence (“It’s the right thing”) yields to relinquishing his cloak after the mirror’s revelation. The single tightening—brass chime’s clang fading into harmony—narrows his options from vengeance to nuance. Cost is legible: he forfeits the armor of righteousness, shivering but upright. Coincidence never resolves; wind merely reveals what Kaelen chooses to heed.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to cross the ocean in one step to find his sister—is signaled early and deepens when he realizes his desire itself is the obstacle. The tightening occurs at the ripple reversal: his understanding that vanishing requires releasing ego forecloses his prior path of forceful intention. Cost is unmistakable—“drowning in your own wake” literalizes the emotional price—and agency is fully his; Elara only provides the frame. Escalation is driven by protagonist perception under Accumulative pressure, culminating in a stance crystallization that reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is deepened when the wandering pulse demands ethical action without physical intrusion. The tightening occurs when Kaelan chooses harmonic resonance over extraction, narrowing options from passive witness to active release. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of neutrality; agency lies in attention and will, not force.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—validating beauty without utility—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s tools fail, forcing him to confront the incompatibility of his worldview with his education. The meaningful tightening occurs when he discards his pack, foreclosing reliance on institutional methods at visible cost (abandoning his identity as a technomancer). Though coincidence doesn’t resolve anything, escalation hinges entirely on Kael’s agency, and the conceptual price—renouncing measurable achievement—is unmistakable in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—keeping a luminous vow to perceive sound’s color—is signaled early and tightens via the once-a-year tide window. Protagonist agency drives escalation: wandering purposefully, checking gear, choosing darkness over torchlight. Cost is unmistakable in physical risk, emotional exposure, and the irreversible act of diving. The deepening—trading external search for internal listening—narrows options to one resonant choice: stillness in the library.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resonance with the universe’s will—is signaled early and deepens when the stubborn pulse demands total commitment. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the coin, reroutes power, endures failure, and persists until breakthrough. The cost is conceptual but legible: abandoning his quest for the new universe’s voice to become archivist of the old. Coincidence (drawing the Sol coin) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his protocol and perseverance earn the echo.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—naming nameless grief—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s desperate ritual, which narrows his options to a single, costly act: crystallizing Elara’s echo at the expense of moving on. Escalation is driven by his agency (choosing the prism, angling light) under Accumulative pressure, and the price is felt in the flawed quartz shard—imperfect, fractured, yet enduring. Coincidence never resolves; the singularity’s threat is backstory, not plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding the world’s song—is signaled early and deepened through Kael’s physical and magical attrition. The escalation is driven by his agency: adjusting drip intervals based on observation, not luck. Cost is unmistakable: “magic utterly spent,” resolve “shattered” yet enduring. The tightening forecloses despair—the final choice to persist yields a resonant payoff that reweights impossibility into plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth to a defamed name—is signaled early via the scratched photograph and intensifies through archival pursuit. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses research over duty, then public correction over silence. The cost is social and emotional: overturning a foundational community myth. Under Causal lens, each beat tightens options until the decisive ledger edit forecloses the lie permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens when Elias abandons calculation for observation, narrowing his options to vulnerability. The starling murmuration complicates (not resolves) his quest, forcing a trade-off: relinquish control or remain stuck. Cost is legible in his “cold and sharp” frustration melting into wonder—a conceptual price paid through renunciation of intellectual dominance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to watch, then approach, then apply flame), though the flock’s guidance flirts with coincidence; it’s mitigated by his prior dismissal of the grimoire passage.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through silent vigilance—is signaled early and tightens when celestial patterns shift toward colonies. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses risky recalibration over system-wide alert, narrowing options under pressure. Cost is felt in tremor, memory, and hollow exhaustion. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his skill and trauma do. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming feeling through authentic creation—is signaled early and tightens when Jin demands surrender of the jar, forcing Kael’s irreversible choice. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency: he chooses to vivify despite doctrine, using complementary opposites. Cost is unmistakable: the drain, the birth of another mind, and the crushing weight of responsibility. Coincidence (timeline flicker) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the victory is earned through paradoxical balance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding innovation through patient creation—is signaled early and deepened via the seed’s decade-long gestation, which narrows options to endurance. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each investigative method (physical, botanical, symbolic) raises conceptual stakes until planting becomes inevitable renunciation of quick solutions. Cost is unmistakable: “grotesque spectacle” he must nurture for years. Coincidence (anonymous mail) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real pressure is internal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through the ghost’s escalating effort (three pulls, engine scream, hallway performance). Agency is non-traditional but potent: his orchestration forces family out of stasis. Cost is felt (his spectral helplessness, their stagnant grief) and tightens options—only noise can breach silence. Escalation is driven by his mournful eagerness under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—enduring displacement versus seizing false return—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant offers “terrible, absolute certainty.” Pressure escalates organically: the cultist’s intrusion → pendant’s whisper → portal’s violent tear. Lyel’s agency drives the climax; he doesn’t resist temptation passively but actively repurposes his longing to smother the signal. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits home’s vision to protect the library’s integrity, crystallizing his stance with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping soul-grinding mediocrity—is signaled early and tightens with each failure. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes he’s replicating Guildmaster tyranny, forcing a renunciation of control. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices the relic’s form to birth new magic. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. The final choice forecloses his old path with serene finality.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the shard of hush—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elara discards three assumptions, each narrowing options and raising risk (e.g., opening all channels invites system collapse). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: noise density increases until her inversion creates a null-point. Cost is felt in her bone-deep despair and the tower’s groan at perigee zenith, making the final Charged Poise—a city waiting—legible as earned. No coincidence resolves conflict; victory arises solely from her reconfigured method.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending fractured reality—is signaled by the empty hourglass and deepened when Finn decodes the radio’s patterned static. His agency drives escalation: matching frequency to starlight isn’t luck but earned synthesis. Cost is legible in his Charged Poise ending—he’s bound to seams forever—but the container ship lie slightly softens consequence, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens when memory alters, forcing Elias to weave a colder truth. Agency is clear: he chooses to incorporate, not resist, the shift, which narrows his emotional options irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable: the connection he finds is “terribly, terribly cold,” and he becomes part of the illusion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the single tightening (memory shift → lattice vibration → eruption) borders on minimal for 8.9+; it just clears the threshold via visceral intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redefining navigation beyond the seabed—is signaled early and deepens when alien trajectory data reveals cosmic “edge geometry.” Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: secret research, algorithm design, council confrontation. The tightening forecloses complacency; cost is felt as professional risk and existential grief for a “small” world. Under Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification (pattern emergence) suffices, though a second pressure beat (council resistance) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to soothe her grandson’s guilt—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the hearing aid’s pulse intensifies near Leo. Elias’s agency drives the escalation: his tuning, scanning, and approach force the confrontation. The cost is felt (Leo’s emotional burden) and resolved through stance crystallization, not coincidence. However, the pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric; there’s no tangible trade-off or foreclosed path beyond emotional relief, which slightly limits the stakes’ visceral weight under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—granting peace to the unremembered—is signaled early and deepens when physical access fails, forcing Elias to use his unique ability at personal risk. The tightening (collapse blocking path) narrows options, compelling phase transition—a costly, uncertain tactic. Agency drives escalation: his choice to proceed despite panic raises emotional and physical stakes. Cost is felt in chest-tightening fear and the irreversible act of closure; no off-stage resolution or luck.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—fetching wisdom from failure—is signaled early and deepens when the ink coalesces into Aris’s insight. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her sustained focus and physical ritual narrow options until revelation occurs. The cost is conceptual yet visceral: accepting that absence holds structure, which reframes her own erased existence. No coincidence resolves tension; the breakthrough emerges from her labor.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes—saving a language by reading the world’s skin—are signaled early and intensified through tactile struggle. The tightening occurs when Kaelen realizes sound must be filtered, not amplified, narrowing his options to one fragile alignment. Agency drives escalation: he chooses the tower, reads the flock, twists the stone. Cost is felt in the lifelong solitude preceding this singular, trembling act.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving Clara vs. exposing Elara—tightens decisively when Julian witnesses the man’s metamorphosis, forcing him to confront his own bitterness. The escalation is driven by Julian’s agency: his surveillance leads to revelation, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his sister-as-he-knew-her for “frostbitten hope” in who she’s become. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it’s devastatingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reawakening organic beauty against mechanized sterility—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating vulnerability. Her agency drives escalation: choosing resonant softness over force, syncing heartbeat to bow, placing shell on bark. Cost is unmistakable: physical depletion, risk of capture, and the irreversible shattering of the orchard’s old order. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—one tightening (the Wardens’ charge) forces her final, all-in commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reuniting a family with their daughter’s digital ghost—is signaled early and deepened by the “illegal act” of fostering connection. Elias’s agency drives escalation: weeks of mapping voids culminate in threading the needle. The tightening forecloses all paths but one: the 30-second static window. Cost is unmistakable—the perpetual risk, the silence after, the knowledge that tomorrow demands another delivery. No coincidence resolves; every pressure point stems from protagonist’s meticulous rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence into meaningful sound—is signaled early and deepens when the halo fragment shifts Elias from mender to creator. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to crown the mare, triggering the gust and song. Cost is unmistakable: his voice, unused for a decade, becomes both gift and sacrifice, altering his relationship to solitude. Coincidence (the gust) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the song arises from his preparedness, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the place where stories live—is signaled early and deepened through Elias’s meticulous, high-stakes ritual. The escalation is driven entirely by his agency: arranging books, consulting Lobachevsky, draping the scarf. The cost is unmistakable in the trembling hands and evaporated vision, and though the patrons’ obliviousness adds ambient tension, the real pressure is internal and conceptual. One meaningful tightening occurs—the vision appears then vanishes—narrowing future attempts to moments of even greater precision. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Elias’s method almost works, and that near-success is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recapturing a lost feeling—is signaled early and deepens through Silas’s narrowing world (only pre-dawn, only one boat, only one palette). Escalation is driven by agency: he chooses to chase, develop, paint. The fog-morning represents a decisive tightening—his instinct overrides routine. Cost is felt in decades of failed attempts and the hollowed days; final success trades pursuit for stillness, a credible renunciation under Accumulative pressure. No off-stage luck resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing the son’s unwritten symphony—is signaled early and deepens through the Locksmith’s realization that fear expects a key, not dissolution. The tightening occurs when he chooses disorientation over confrontation, narrowing tactics to one fragile, star-dependent method. Cost is visible: the Locksmith expends no physical toll, but the emotional weight of bearing others’ trapped longings is implied in his silent departure. Agency is quiet but decisive—his hum alters reality through attunement, not force.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are singular and deeply personal: recover stolen memories or remain haunted. The tightening occurs when routine observation fractures into active interference—a trade-off between academic purity and emotional need. Elias’s agency drives the escalation: his curiosity compels the touch, which yields partial truth at the cost of his lifelong discipline. The price is unmistakable in the “hollow and full” ache and the reconfiguration of his mission from recovery to beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—earning return from reversible exile—is signaled early and deepens when Kael reveals the trapped shadow as cautionary artifact. Escalation occurs through Elara’s agency: she challenges his fear (“You are not him”), prompting his vulnerable ritual. The tightening forecloses escape-as-resolution; true resilience requires staying. Cost is felt in Kael’s trembling hands and Elara’s choice to rebuild rather than depart—stakes evolve from physical return to psychological readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and deepens through the greyness’s encroachment. Escalation occurs via one meaningful intensification: Elian’s realization that physical planting is insufficient, requiring transcendent intervention. His agency drives the turn—he chooses to weave between worlds—and the cost is felt in the trembling foundation and his solitary burden. Though stakes are high (spiritual survival of the world), they remain viscerally grounded in sensory decay, avoiding telescopic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving interlaced hush against spirit-induced unraveling—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen admits “the silence is frayed.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing a knot, inserting the needle, pouring calm into the tool. Cost is visible in exhaustion and the transferred burden to Kaelen. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false intensifiers or off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence—tightens decisively when Elara discovers the lichen discrepancy, narrowing her options from repair to acknowledgment. Agency is clear: her methodical comparison drives the escalation, and the cost is conceptual (abandoning restoration for reverence). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density of visual data intensifies until the pattern break screams. The vault’s sealed door crystallizes stakes without external antagonism, proving internal conflict can carry weight at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens when the physicist’s failure reframes it. The meaningful tightening occurs at the strongbox: discovery forces a choice between extraction and reverence. Cost is legible in the narrator’s decision to leave the globe, foreclosing personal possession for ethical witness. Coincidence (sonar fluke) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is interpretive, not mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—combating Lyra’s consciousness decay through encoded art—tightens when thunder threatens to sever the link, forcing Elian’s “focused haste.” Agency drives escalation: his glyph-painting directly provokes the system’s reply. Cost is felt in the “heart-stopping second” of potential failure and the weary smile acknowledging temporariness. Coincidence (lightning/thunder) complicates but doesn’t resolve; success stems from his precise, practiced ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Elara’s hidden joy—is signaled early and tightens when Kael uses the goggles to decrypt. His agency drives escalation: choosing to look, to unfold, to protect. The cost is felt in his intruder’s guilt and the irreversible knowledge he now bears. Coincidence (sunlight at third floor) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decryption requires his active application of her tools.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and deepens through cloud categorization, culminating in the fractal discovery. Pressure tightens via emotional specificity: each cloud type forecloses scientific detachment, escalating toward the incandescent anger cloud that demands recognition. Cost is conceptual (abandoning empirical rigor) and felt (the ache of peace). Though coincidence plays no role, the escalation is driven by observation rather than active choice, slightly limiting agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“mirror the sky inside walls”) is signaled early and deepens into a thematic confrontation with finitude. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her fingers transcribe chaos into mechanism under literal deadline pressure. The cost—imminent destruction—is felt in vibrations and groans, culminating in Earned Stasis: she completes her task knowing the sanctuary will fall. Coincidence complicates (machinery halts, then resumes), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—charting the stranded luminance—is signaled early and deepens when the hopscotch board reframes the quest as temporal, not spatial. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his choice to interpret scuffs as code tightens options, forcing real-time tracking of birds. Cost is felt in his prior failures (“frustration pricked”) and culminates in earned awe, though the price remains conceptual (isolation transformed, not sacrificed). Coincidence complicates (birds obscure view) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through repair—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the key is “absent light,” forcing her to risk using the eclipse essence. This deepening forecloses safer options (metal keys, direct gaze) and imposes cost: psychological exposure to infinite failures. Agency drives escalation—she chooses shadow over certainty—and the price (solitary endurance) crystallizes in the ending’s quiet harmony. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory and symbolic density.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escape to the nebula—is signaled early and tightens via each message-driven task, culminating in a physically perilous collective effort. Agency is collective but focused through Elara and Anya; their choices foreclose safer alternatives (e.g., staying put). Cost is visible: exhaustion, risk of fall, emotional toll of doubt. Escalation is driven by protagonist decisions under Causal pressure, not coincidence—the ghost guides but does not solve. Final alignment demands precise timing, raising stakes without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—granting peace to all lost lives—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s translation act, which narrows his options to total self-annihilation. Agency is clear: he chooses to weave the lullaby despite knowing it consumes him. The tightening occurs when the lighthouse thrums—the final ripple arrives—and he must act immediately or fail his purpose. Cost is visceral: energy drains, breath ragged, body slumps; the price is his existence, paid without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before frost—tightens causally: the horn call forces action, the ticking frost clock raises urgency, and bird aggression escalates risk. Elias’s agency drives escalation; he chooses to assemble despite cost. The trade-off is legible: energy spent = nut hollowed = personal depletion. Coincidence complicates (wind swallows horn) but never resolves; success stems from inherited skill under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early and deepens when Aris realizes rigid polymers mirror his parenting. His agency drives escalation: observing foam patterns leads to insight that redefines his options. Cost is unmistakable: enduring years of silence, confronting his role in the rift, and relinquishing control (“not an apology... but a celebration”). The river’s logic forecloses his old path permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled early and deepens through quantifying absence. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: each measurement narrows toward the silent tree. The incision is a trade-off—sacrificing perfection for potential—with cost felt in the tremor that awakens the library. Coincidence never resolves; insight arises from disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—relieving stored remorse—is signaled early and tightens when the fossil forces Kaelen into active subsumption. Escalation is driven by his agency: tasting → mapping → digging → absorbing. Cost is unmistakable: his heart becomes “terrifyingly smooth,” and the pavilion crumbles. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density, not coincidence, culminating in a trade-off between personal peace and cosmic burden.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating communal spirit before fracture—is signaled early and tightens when the cuckoo weight trembles violently, forcing Elias’s decisive nudge. Escalation is driven by his agency: each language layer deepens pressure, narrowing options until only empathetic precision remains. Cost is felt (sweat, psychic fatigue) but not fully priced—no irreversible loss tempers the victory, slightly softening stakes. Still, tension operates at sentence level (“angry chatter crackling,” “digital screaming”) and peaks credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving abandoned dreams against erasure—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Elara chooses to modify her mind, risking self-dissolution. The tightening occurs when she isolates the composer’s dream, narrowing her focus amid the “maelstrom.” Cost is unmistakable: neural strain (“head throbbed”), identity fragmentation threat, and the irreversible rewiring that makes the symphony hers. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each memory layer increases density until the crystalline pattern emerges, forcing her decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations to combat intellectual plague—is signaled early and tightens when gravity inversion begins ticking down. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers the doodle’s function, aligns it with environmental cues, and memorizes the synthesis under duress. Cost is unmistakable: near-death escape, irreversible burden, and the extinguishing of the doodle’s light. One meaningful deepening occurs—the realization the wall is a reflection—which narrows options to a single perceptual act. Coincidence never resolves; physics and mind do.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating silent tension into audible harmony—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from imposition to release. The tightening occurs at the Old One: recognizing stress cracks as autobiography reframes her entire method. Agency drives escalation; each strum is a deliberate choice narrowing options toward symphonic unity. Cost is felt in the “hollow space” filled by vibration, and the final silence carries earned weight. Coincidence never resolves; insight and empathy alone enable the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the nexus’s hidden logic—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelan’s translation of silence. His agency drives escalation: assigning values to pauses, charting void-data, culminating in the luminous corollary. The “price” is exile itself, repurposed as necessary condition for discovery. Though coincidence (celestial alignment) triggers the display, the revelation is earned by his prior work—the lights pulse to *his* deciphered rhythm, not random fortune.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the specific silence of unwavering devotion—is signaled early and deepens as external pressure (approaching fireworks) narrows Elias’s window. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: his memory of his grandmother’s hands guides a decisive dial twist that bypasses mechanical logic for intuitive truth. The cost is legible in the final image: he gains emotional resonance but permanently relinquishes textual access, a trade-off made under duress. Coincidence (the firework timing) complicates but does not resolve; the breakthrough stems from Elias’s internal calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity amid motion—is signaled early and deepened when the tide-turning wind threatens to overwhelm. Elara’s agency lies in attention: choosing what to listen for amid chaos. Cost is unmistakable (“pain bloomed,” urge to flee) and alters tactics—she filters noise rather than resisting it. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s sensory endurance under Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the gossamer-fruit trees—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the solution isn’t a cure but access to ancestral vitality. Pressure escalates causally: the arrow tip’s hum intensifies, the cavern reveals the source, and gravity’s return forces a high-stakes extraction. Cost is visible in the narrow time window and physical risk of maneuvering through stone arches. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second trade-off (e.g., sacrificing something beyond time) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the silence—is signaled early and deepens when the patch reframes the event as aerial. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: he reorients sensors, adapts algorithms, and interprets vectors. Cost is legible in his hollow victory and crushing isolation. Coincidence (drone failure + container rupture + inversion) complicates but doesn’t resolve; causality remains protagonist-led through data interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when Kael interprets the aurora through the amber sheet, transforming celestial light into sensory symphony. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his choice to ring the bells unfetters global wonder, with visible cost in the dissolution of the old order. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; each bell strike deepens the sensory cascade until the world’s grey canvas is irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding his failure—is signaled early and deepens through one pivotal turn: playing the flute as question, not command. This act, driven by agency, narrows options (he cannot revert to old methods) and reweights the world’s rules. Cost is unmistakable: the “lancing of a wound that had festered for years.” Pressure escalates texturally—the canyon hush intensifies, the air shimmers—until the insight crystallizes stance without external conflict, satisfying Situational escalation under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmuting unbearable grief into comprehensible form—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s ritual. Pressure escalates via deliberate ambiguity and the transposition process, narrowing Anya’s emotional options from raw pain to structured perception. The cost is legible: Anya gains insight but loses the illusion of solace; Elias gains data but remains isolated. Agency lies in Anya’s acceptance of the card—a renunciation of comfort for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—delivering the pendant while managing fear—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant activates, transforming delivery into witness. The escalation is driven by environmental coincidence (aurora pulse) but gains agency through Kael’s sustained attention; he doesn’t act, but his choice to remain present allows the encounter to unfold. Cost is legible in his relinquished desire for tavern hand-offs and the quiet burden of carrying revelation, though the lack of active decision slightly softens the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving emotional imprinting—is signaled early and deepens when the prism reveals mechanical failure instead of love. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the moment, sets the experiment, and interprets the result. The cost is conceptual and existential: his worldview collapses into “broken steel and indifferent physics.” Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with the “shifted hush” marking irreversible knowledge gain.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist-driven sacrifice: each golden thread requires surrendering a memory. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the puzzle edges are the map, transforming passive longing into active weaving. Final agency lies in her deliberate recommencement despite the void where his name once was. Cost is legible in every beat and crystallizes in the “hollow cavern” of her heart post-completion—pressure coheres entirely under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s escalating sacrifice. His agency drives escalation: he chooses the mine, selects the geode, and initiates the barter. The cost is unmistakable: hollowed memory for planetary pulse. Under an Accumulative lens, the single deepening (memory-for-life) reweights the entire emotional and ecological economy with devastating clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind Elara’s death—is signaled early and tightens when Kael witnesses the resonance cascade. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to redirect, not block, the energy, accepting he cannot save her. The cost—permanent loss reframed as cosmic inevitability—is felt in the quiet aftermath. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fragile world built across silence—is signaled early and tightens when the light fails. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to cross the storm, climb, repair, and say farewell via stones. The cost is palpable: the keeper is gone, the bond ended, yet he acts anyway. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory and emotional density, not external antagonism, and culminates in a stance crystallized by loss.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harnessing chaos to forge renewal—is signaled early and tightens as the “monster” storm strains the wick to nova. Agency is clear: Kaelan steers via levers, carves narratives into clouds. Cost is legible in his trembling body and unintended prophecies. Under Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density (glyphs → tapestry → white-hot strain), not causality, but climax remains protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding how stories adhere to certain people—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s methodical observation. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait but devises an experiment (sun trails), narrowing his focus from general curiosity to specific luminous anomalies. The cost is conceptual but felt: he abandons control (dye = substance) for surrender (light = refraction), trading mastery for wonder. While pressure remains internal, it coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the morpho wing and chalk arcs serving as tangible evidence of rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving sorrow a home—is signaled early and deepens when the shard’s origin reveals catastrophic loss (the felled tree). Aris’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to analyze, map, and archive, narrowing options to ritual precision. The sorrow-meter spike and moonlight healing impose a cadence shift that reweights the stake from collection to consecration. Cost is unmistakable: the tree’s death is irreversible, and Aris bears witness without intervention—endurance as action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a realm that forgot warmth—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s gathering of song fragments, each retrieval narrowing her path toward the final performance. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: care begets memory begets magic. Cost is felt in her isolation and mental fragmentation, though the physical/emotional toll could be sharper; the victory feels slightly unearned given the absence of failed attempts or resistance beyond internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting empathetic overwhelm into quiet connection—is signaled early and deepened when Elara’s sorrow reframes the conclave’s threat. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his choice to hide enables detached observation, which crystallizes insight. The tightening forecloses his original refusal’s logic, replacing it with nuanced understanding. Cost is felt in the enlarged tranquility: solitude transformed but not abandoned, carrying the weight of shared loneliness without direct engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the sacred ordinary against systemic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the patrolman embodies the conflict (duty vs. memory). Elara’s agency drives escalation: her gardening provokes confrontation, and her choice to “uncloak” by offering the bread heel forces the patrolman’s micro-reversal. Cost is felt in what’s lost (Miller’s, civic trust) and what’s risked (arrest, emotional exposure). The tightening forecloses passive observation—Elara must act or surrender memory.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning before total erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the vow’s light begins to pulse erratically. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: his micro-choices (adjusting dials, stabbing the rune) narrow options under rising pressure. The cost is unmistakable: the slide’s inert death, the vanished projection, the knowledge that a city below has lost its bond. Coincidence never resolves; the flare is the vow’s last act, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving familial loyalty encoded in the fob—is signaled early and tightens when Eva’s ambition threatens the market’s fragile truce. Elara’s agency drives escalation: chaos → law → bribery → truth-as-weapon. Each turn narrows options (Boro’s dismissal eliminates legal recourse; Silas’s sneer kills negotiation). Cost is felt in her desperation and the irreversible exposure of Silas, though the truce’s survival remains ambiguous—a minor softness in stakes resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the “emergent compass”—tightens when carriers converge, merging storms into a single atmospheric event that validates then transcends Elara’s hypothesis. Her agency drives escalation: she senses, interprets, and witnesses, but crucially does not intervene, letting the phenomenon unfold. Cost is felt in her relinquished control—the compass spins “frantically” while living systems overwhelm it—and crystallized in closure’s “humbling scale.” Coincidence (aurora timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the forests’ election season enables but doesn’t dictate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unlocking suppressed creativity—is signaled early and tightened when Elias realizes the painting is a key, not a memory. His agency drives escalation: he abandons force for finesse, using his mnemonic gift not to copy but to interpret. Cost is felt in the broken lock (past failure) and the tear (emotional exposure). Pressure coheres causally to a Charged Poise ending.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering authenticity—is signaled early via the fern’s reaction to market haggling. Pressure tightens when the map deepens from treasure hunt to existential quest (“convergence of echoes”), narrowing options to a single vault. Agency drives escalation: Elian’s meticulous piecing together of fragments forces the discovery. Cost is felt in his irreversible commitment to cultivate truth in a hostile world, crystallized in the plaza planting.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing a fading truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elian chooses self-destruction over preservation. His agency drives escalation: each cut frees a note, culminating in the wind-triggered performance. Cost is unmistakable: the iceberg’s form is sacrificed to renew collective memory. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—no false turns, no off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static to achieve selfhood—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the android risks system overload to compress chaos. Agency drives every escalation: rerouting power, interfacing with regulators, triggering the dome breach. Cost is visceral: consciousness nearly fragments, life support is sacrificed, and perfection is abandoned. The magnetic shift complicates but doesn’t resolve—the android’s will and rewired programming earn the victory. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, narrowing options until only the “controlled burn” remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal dignity against bureaucratic violence—is signaled early and tightens when management threatens to drill the lock. Elias’s agency lies in renunciation: he refuses force, instead creating space for memory to solve the problem. The cost is subtle but felt: time, collective anxiety, and the risk of failure. Escalation occurs through density of testimony, not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating her mother’s consciousness through code-breaking—is signaled early and tightens when conventional logic fails, forcing Elara into dance-as-decryption. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her realization that “the final key wasn’t a solution to be derived; it was a variable to be surrendered” shifts tactics from control to receptivity. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her mother’s purist logic, embracing chance as strength. Coincidence complicates (opaque cipher) but resolution is earned through her lyrical surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving Elara’s stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the whale’s decay creates accessible gravity pockets. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, perform the ritual, and reach into the pocket, risking emotional collapse. The cost is felt in the fragment’s fleeting return and his gasping stumble—proof with price. Coincidence (whale’s death) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn stems from Silas’s persistent method.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing coded prophecy from inciting chaos—is signaled early and tightens via Elara’s method: targeting “gaps between words” deepens the conflict from suppression to absorption. Agency is clear (her mapping guides the tide of silence), and cost is legible in the “fragile blanket” metaphor—peace is temporary, requiring recurrence. Escalation lacks a physical reversal but intensifies texturally as silence “swallows” sound planetarily.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the building’s language—is signaled early and deepens when Clara’s curiosity curdles into need. The single escalation (inviting Elias to the roof) is driven by her agency and narrows options: lies can no longer suffice. Cost is felt in the loss of comforting fiction and the burden of new responsibility as “librarian of whispers.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density, not external threat, culminating in a Charged Poise where stakes are reconfigured but not resolved conventionally.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elian chooses full memory over safe emptiness. Escalation is protagonist-driven: he initiates contact, pushes harder, demands the “full story.” Cost is unmistakable: re-experiencing Lyra’s death in visceral detail. The narrowing window (last star fading) forces a now-or-never choice that crystallizes his stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—freeing generations from a futile oath—are clear by paragraph two and tighten through Kaelen’s precise act. The single meaningful deepening occurs when he adds the tail: a microscopic choice with kingdom-scale consequence. Cost is felt in his trembling and the “wisely enduring” strain. No coincidence; agency drives escalation under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some echo while others don’t—is signaled early and deepens into cosmic debt vs. completion. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each song tightens knowledge, culminating in the choice to sing acceptance rather than demand answers. Cost is unmistakable: Lyra abandons her private sorrow for communal duty, trading inquiry for service. The “unfinished” revelation forces a trade-off between personal closure and universal balance, sharpened by moral calculus (helping others find silence vs. solving her own mystery).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the boy’s spirit—is signaled early and tightens when the man’s interference emerges. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she deepens trance to construct a shared dreamscape, risking psychic exposure. Cost is visible in the candle flames dimming and the emotional toll of confronting manufactured lies. The man’s dissolution and the boy’s release reconfigure options irreversibly, though the story slightly softens consequence by resolving cleanly without lingering trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—connection to the hidden pattern—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen abandons observation for interaction. His agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, follow moon paths, and whistle. The cost is conceptual but felt: his sound is briefly harmonized with the fireflies, then ignored, affirming human smallness. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices; pressure tightens via sensory immersion rather than external opposition. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—it underscores the indifference of the natural order, which heightens thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. protective myth—is signaled by paragraph two and escalates through Kaelen’s methodical work. The meaningful deepening occurs when Thorne’s letters reveal the engineered “curse,” forcing Kaelen to choose: expose the truth (risking weaponization) or preserve the lie. Agency is crystallized in the final act of *using* the diamond as lens, not just observing it. Cost is conceptual: the comfort of myth is lost, replaced by fragile, weaponizable knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forging human-led renewal against spectral domination—is signaled early and tightens when dueling voices force a choice. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he interprets, broadcasts, collects faith, then commands. The meaningful deepening occurs at the climax: unfolding the map reweights options, offering a third way. Cost is unmistakable—abandoning ghostly wisdom for fragile human solidarity—but the lacquered chest’s sudden accessibility leans slightly toward convenience, softening causality just enough to dock 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unheard beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the poet chooses not to fix the music box but to “sweeten its profound and empty quiet.” This agency-driven escalation narrows options: he must compose a new eulogy from shore sounds, paying the cost of labor and emotional exposure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each captured sound tightens the thematic knot until the symphony resolves it with felt weight. Coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the poet’s choices earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the Siren’s Heart—is signaled early and tightens when brute resistance proves impossible, forcing adaptation via vibrational mirroring. This deepening forecloses the option of direct confrontation and imposes physical cost (molecular realignment, teeth-rattling tremor). Agency is clear: Elara chooses integration over annihilation. Cost is unmistakable in her slumped, sweat-soaked body against the console—a price paid to maintain balance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—severing the Authority’s control through celestial timing—is signaled early and tightens when Lyra nears the meridian. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: her calculations, steadied breath, and final click exploit the network’s vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: the wildness she tames could have doomed them, and victory arrives not with fanfare but “profound quiet.” Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her preparation turns it into advantage.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus bureaucratic expediency—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to document Finch’s obsession. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: touching the lantern, reading the journal, defying Fletcher. Cost is felt (professional risk) though not yet paid; the tightening forecloses the easy sign-off. Coincidence (distant train rumble) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency remains Elias’s.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether broken men can be reached by faith or craft—is signaled early and deepens when Arthur admits words failed Thorne. The tightening occurs when Elias reframes forgiveness as unearned grace, narrowing Arthur’s options from repair to revelation. Agency is internal but decisive: Arthur chooses to stop apologizing and start seeking cracks. Cost is felt in his relinquished authority and the irreversible loss of Thorne, made visible in the silent cot and cold brass heart.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the Yearning Algorithm—is signaled early and tightens when the glyph resolves into “Grip,” forcing a rebuild under time pressure. Agency is clear: Kaelen’s feverish modifications narrow options to one impossible act. Cost is felt in solitude (no one to tell) and physical risk (acid sea “rushing up to claim him”). Coincidence never resolves; success stems from his stubborn execution of the Algorithm’s command.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering Julian’s truth—is signaled early and tightens when Kael appears, raising surveillance pressure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: noticing patterns, bypassing security, lying under duress. The cost is felt throughout (isolation, fear) and crystallizes in the final act: exposing corruption forfeits her job but fulfills her purpose. The deepening from personal grief to political whistleblowing reweights the entire search with social consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—communal survival versus fracture—is signaled immediately and deepens when Kael uncovers that Jorn tried to mend the line and Mara fears repetition of past loss. This tightening forecloses accusation and forces empathetic reckoning. Agency lies in Kael’s choice to seek truth, not impose verdict, and the cost is emotional exposure for all. Pressure coheres causally: each vision narrows misunderstanding, culminating in a trade-off between fear and trust.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the texture of endings—is signaled early and deepens via the “fold in patience” metaphor. Agency lies in attention: her trawling is methodical, selfish, and culminates in stance crystallization when the ice sighs. Pressure escalates texturally (debris → wind → ice groan), not causally, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt as relinquished uncertainty, though a tighter tactical constraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why love failed—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s agrarian analogy, narrowing options from blame to acceptance. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from guarding memory to tending it, foreclosing the path of resentment. Cost is felt in the “fragility” of the paper and the quiet admission of mutual unsuitability. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his reflective parallel-drawing), though the absence of external pressure slightly limits tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving undiluted truth—is signaled early and tightens when zeal distorts the prophet’s words. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he leaves, walks, activates the parapet, and consecrates the echo. Cost is felt in his solitude and irreversible commitment to silent guardianship. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening occurs via sensory and conceptual intensification (whispers → silence, distortion → pure echo), not causal reversal, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming collective trauma into coherence—is signaled early and deepens as vines climb and photos accumulate. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias places the girl’s photo, completing the arc and foreclosing further collection; this act crystallizes his purpose with opportunity cost (his work ends, unseen). Agency is subtle but present: each seasonal return and placement is a choice. However, external pressure is minimal—the conflict is almost entirely internal/textural—which slightly limits escalation under strict causal standards, though it fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding language’s growth—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal reveals process over product. The meaningful intensification occurs in Elias’s weeks of listening, narrowing his path from academic publication to silent testimony. Agency drives escalation: his choice to interpret chaos as pattern forces renunciation of legacy. Cost is felt in his isolation and the irreversible turn from print to ephemeral witness.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens as Silas realizes possession is impossible. The tightening occurs when memory fails at the altar, forcing renunciation over capture. Agency drives escalation: his walk, his reading of driftwood, his final decision to draw the circle. Cost is unmistakable: the white O dissolving into mist embodies the very entropy he sought to trap—felt, visible, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving the station by anchoring time—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes slowing the hand won’t work; only restructuring the anchor will. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to sacrifice his most treasured object, aligning it at the precise nanosecond dictated by lunar physics. The cost is legible in the ending: stability achieved at the price of temporal stasis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—each vibration, crack, and whine tightens the narrative spring until release becomes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when Lena resists; Elara’s agency (“firm, compassionate truth”) forces the only viable path. The meaningful deepening occurs when ordinary acts (brewing tea, placing a chair) become tactical hymns that lower defenses. Cost is visible: Lena’s clipped resistance yields to silent presence, and Mr. Aris pays with his last breath in that earned stillness. Coincidence never resolves; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering shadow behavior under noon light—is signaled early and deepens via the automaton’s activation. Pressure escalates through intellectual labor: relearning runes, aligning paradoxical rings. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes causality itself is warped, demanding non-mechanical key use (pushing, not turning). Cost is conceptual—accepting that truth requires abandoning old logics—but could feel more viscerally embodied in physical or temporal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciling rationality with love’s faith—is signaled early and deepens when the tooth shatters Elias’s certainty. His agency drives escalation: digging, opening the box, choosing to map rather than deny. The cost is visceral (his tear) and existential (the “compound fracture of the soul”). Under the Accumulative lens, each layer of memory and doubt tightens pressure until the final renunciation of his old self feels both earned and devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating non-destructive light—is signaled early and tightens when Elara weighs the glass against fire’s memory, narrowing her options to patient craft. Escalation is driven by her agency: each polishing stroke deepens commitment, culminating in the glass’s autonomous glow. Cost is unmistakable: solitude, physical labor, and renunciation of easy brilliance. Slight cap because the “village fire” backstory, while evocative, isn’t tested on-page beyond memory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—Kaelen’s public failure versus private redemption—is signaled early and deepened by Elara’s “quietly proactive” tactics. The drip pattern’s emergence forces a meaningful turn: ice melting becomes metaphor for thawing shame. Cost is felt in Kaelen’s resignation and Elara’s risk in offering the pendant. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—observation leads to revelation that reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming creative integrity—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes he cannot resurrect his characters but can honor them. Pressure escalates texturally: each cameo intensifies his guilt until the gale-force current nearly sweeps him away. His agency drives the climax (burying the shell), forcing a trade-off: sacrificing his last token of childhood hope to release his ghosts. Cost is felt in the quiet clarity replacing despair—a resonant recalibration under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring communal memory through ritual—is signaled early and deepens when the vine’s luminescence falters, demanding Elian’s tinkerer’s ear to correct dissonance. This tightening forces a trade-off: precision over haste, risking missed alignment. The cost is felt in the solitude of his task and the weight of being sole custodian. Though stakes are high, the absence of external opposition limits escalation—but under an Accumulative lens, this inward pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating a child’s panic into safe passage—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s physical sacrifice and emotional containment. Escalation is driven by his agency: each deliberate step (arranging detritus, pouring starlight, sealing intention) narrows options toward irreversible commitment. Cost is unmistakable in bodily strain and the relinquishment of the map, which cannot be reclaimed once sent. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a resonant trade: his stillness for her movement.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against entropy—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s methodical reconstruction. Pressure escalates texturally: days bleed into weeks, ledger fills, silence thickens, until the final test at dusk. Agency is sustained through attention and craft; no coincidence resolves the problem. Cost is felt in time lost, solitude endured, and the unspoken knowledge that these echoes may remain unheard—a conceptual price embedded in the final image of solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—relieving human sorrow while remaining imprisoned—is signaled early and tightens when the farmer’s “shard of glass” grief arrives. Kaelen’s agency lies in orientation and endurance; his act forecloses personal freedom but grants relief. Cost is felt in his isolation and the accumulating weight of silence. Escalation occurs through density (new burden during snowmelt thaw), not external conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing Leo’s essence without succumbing to grief—is signaled early and deepens when memory replaces spectacle. The tightening occurs in her shift from wanting his presence to needing his lesson, crystallized in the cub anecdote. Agency drives escalation: she chooses stillness over sentiment, carving over mourning. Cost is unmistakable—the scream of the kettle marks the price of transmuting memory into form.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with his ghost through collected echoes—is signaled early and deepens when the camera wheel shifts his method from overheard stories to personal accountability. Pressure tightens causally: the rhythmic clicking leads to excavation, which triggers memory, which forces confrontation. The cost is conceptual (loss of self-deception) and emotional (shared sorrow with his younger self). Agency drives every escalation; coincidence merely delivers the object, not the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning from institutional failure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara shifts from assessment to activation. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting symbols, rerouting power, inserting the sextant. Cost is felt in the quiet disappointment before success and the solitary wonder after—no crowd witnesses the dream reborn. Coincidence (carnival’s leftover gear) complicates plausibly but doesn’t resolve; her skill makes it work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: bearing the coffer, arranging bells, enduring the weight. Escalation occurs via textural intensification (rain → dripping → sunlight) that narrows options to ritual release. Cost is felt physically (“ache in his arms,” “wet chill”) and existentially (silence as “tomb” vs. “canvas”). The tightening forecloses revival of the carillon dream permanently, with visible sacrifice: leaving the silver constellation exposed.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective falsehood—is signaled early and deepens when the blueprints reveal dual authorship. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses where to cast, how to pry, what to believe. The tightening occurs when the journal reframes disgrace as sacrifice, foreclosing the path of resentment. Cost is conceptual (a lifetime of familial shame) and felt (the weight of the lockbox, the groan of tortured metal). Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving vanishing epistemologies—is signaled early and deepens as the knot reveals itself as navigational cartography. Pressure escalates texturally: snow, then fog, then silence narrow the world until only the rope and fulgurite remain. Elias’s agency lies in attention, not action; his “coaxing” is a form of resistance against erasure. Cost is conceptual but legible: the near-total loss of a civilizational language, now rescued at the edge of oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—articulating explained absences—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes Elara’s weaving was cartography, not craft. The meaningful tightening occurs during projection: witnessing her grief transforms his task from documentation to communion. Cost is felt (“silence deeper,” “chill sharper”) and conceptual—accepting that some journeys end in withdrawal, not return. Escalation is driven by Kaelen’s agency (focusing on the thread), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening organic beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes his idealized Lumina-wing cannot return. The tightening occurs when he chooses lichen resin over synthetics, narrowing his options to fragile, uncertain means. Cost is visceral: his physical deterioration, sleepless haze, and ultimate surrender of his dream. The bird’s hybrid form forces a moral recalibration—beauty now includes machinery—and the city’s pause proves the stakes were real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rewriting her inheritance through preservation—tightens decisively when Elara abandons perimeter firefighting to graft the banyan, narrowing options to one fragile act of synthesis. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her father’s coin (emotional heirloom) to bind the graft, trading memory for hope. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the blaze. The red thread’s vibrancy against charcoal bark visually crystallizes the moral calculus: living bonds over dead symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s internal conflict between logic and longing. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: rotating the box aligns colors, which “unsticks” time. Cost is visible in the geese’s departure (external) and her relinquished hush (internal). The tightening occurs when chaotic light resolves into sigil—a single, decisive intensification under Accumulative lens where pattern completion equals stakes reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and tightens when Xylar encounters the gear, which crystallizes the failure of logic-only solutions. The deepening occurs in the realization that light is emission, not resource, forcing a tactical shift from search to broadcast. Cost is felt in the abandonment of ancestral engineering and the acceptance of uncertainty over calculation. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s nightly returns to the greenhouse. The storm serves as a decisive intensification that narrows focus to the “nexus” on the slate, forcing a crystallization of insight. Agency is maintained throughout: his retracing is active inquiry, not passive waiting. Cost is legible in his eased chest and shifted vocation—no longer carving endings but tracing endurance—a trade-off of personal closure for communal witness.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance through time-tending—is signaled early and deepened when Elias confronts his compulsion to contain grief. The escalation is internal but decisive: he must choose between ethical diligence (preserving the inscribed handle) and true absolution (releasing it). This renunciation forecloses personal peace but affirms his duty, with cost legible in the “burden correctly shouldered.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through density of memory and symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering abandoned intention—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s focused labor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to trace frayed threads, cross-reference charts, and isolate the silver strand. The meaningful deepening occurs when echoes coalesce into “frantic hope” and “crushing weight,” narrowing his world to one thread. Cost is unmistakable: the story’s entire emotional architecture hinges on the price of unfulfilled reunion, made visible in the tapestry’s decay and the case’s lonely gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultural revival versus extinction—is signaled early and escalates through Kaelen’s pruning of probabilistic futures. The tightening occurs when he isolates the “cascading series of small, difficult adaptations,” foreclosing grand solutions and demanding collective trust. Cost is unmistakable: “condemn old ways… force hardship on a generation.” Agency is fully his; no coincidence intervenes. The moral calculus—sacrificing one generation for the next—is sharp, credible, and viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden narratives—is signaled early and tightens as Elias transcribes under threat. Agency lies in attention and endurance; his choice to deliver the score narrows future safety. Cost is felt in constant fear and isolation, reweighted by the broadcast’s fragility. Escalation is driven by protagonist action (tuning, writing, delivering), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing grief into static peace—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s omissions and Kael’s surrender to ritual. Pressure coheres accumulatively: each withheld truth (the fire’s simplification, the artist’s suicide) narrows Kael’s path toward illusion. The cost—temporary relief masking inevitable return of grief—is felt in Elara’s closing awareness. While escalation is subtle, it’s sufficient for this length and lens; however, Kael’s agency is largely passive, slightly limiting the pressure’s intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving rational truth against mythic erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the girl calls the cog “ghost-sickness.” Silas’s agency lies in renunciation: he chooses not to argue, accepting barren soil for his truth. The escalation is textural (density of evidence vs. simplicity of myth), not causal, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in his resignation, though the child’s exit slightly softens confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—braid voices into harmony against generational hatred—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias abandons sheet music for silence, narrowing options to a single, vulnerable act. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his insight (“subtracting noise”) reshapes tactics under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the fragility of the achieved unity—it’s “imperfect, wavering,” implying how easily it could fracture. While the antagonistic pressure (township rivalry) is generalized, it suffices for this length and doesn’t rely on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redeeming cultural memory—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s pruning, which forecloses paths of inherited despair. Agency is clear: each cut alters the plant’s trajectory, with cost tasted immediately. Pressure escalates via chaotic growth under celestial light, forcing rapid, high-stakes decisions. The deepening occurs when he shifts from passive witness to active editor of legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring the city’s lost soul—is signaled early and deepens when Lena deciphers the riddle, shifting from glitch-hunting to emotional reawakening. Silas’s agency drives escalation: his refusal to hand over raw data forces Lena into active rediscovery. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the city sacrificed living systems for optimization, sealing its own heart in a “tomb” of routine. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory and poetic detail tightens the thematic vise without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resisting creeping normality—is signaled early and tightens when Elara targets the white cube, raising personal risk. Her agency drives escalation: each displaced object is a tactical choice shaped by prior failures. The deepening occurs at the stoop, where she revises her theory mid-action. Cost is felt in her hammering heart and social invisibility, later redeemed by visible neighborly shifts—proof that her fissures sparked change without resolving all sterility.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to poison the city—is signaled early and tightens causally: each revelation (sanctuary, lung, piracy) raises moral cost. Mara’s agency drives escalation; she chooses to follow, observe, then bury. The trade-off is clear: betray her people or murder an ecosystem. Final renunciation crystallizes under coherent pressure with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of a catastrophic misjudgment—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s methodical work, culminating in the high-risk roll. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his proofs narrow possibility to one nexus point, and the roll’s success exacts immediate cost—the visceral reliving of regret. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern break (the chime, not clatter) and cadence shift (from sterile stillness to sensory flood). The “balancedly daring” act forecloses passive endurance, forcing confrontation with the past at emotional peril.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—will strangers remember kindness?—tightens when Elias illuminates the canvases, risking ridicule. His agency drives escalation: choosing to rouse the city despite doubt. Cost is felt in his hammering heart and the smog’s encroachment. The response—lights blooming like stars—reconfigures stakes from solitary proof to communal witness, with no coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultural and physical survival—is signaled early and tightens when Alistair realizes memory preservation is futile without life. The meaningful deepening occurs at the oven: warmth and creation spark his epiphany, shifting tactics from lament to action. Agency drives escalation; song replaces force. Cost is felt in the elders’ resignation and the ever-present cold, though the resolution leans slightly optimistic without lingering consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying fate’s design—is signaled immediately and deepens when Elias fits the yoyo gear, narrowing options to one irreversible lever pull. Pressure escalates texturally: silence thickens, air shimmers, hands soften. Cost is unmistakable in the ending’s “bleakness of the unknown” and erased identity. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence intervenes. Minor deduction: the hunger stone’s mechanics could clarify how it “consumes alternate probabilities,” slightly muddying tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing Fear’s weakness via the protagonist’s brokenness—is signaled early and deepens through the dream dictionary’s paradoxes. Escalation is driven by agency: each note leads to riskier navigation, culminating in the deliberate confession. The cost (permanent self-alienation, silence of the advisor) is felt in the final poise. Fear’s defeat hinges on a trade-off only this protagonist could make.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the orchard by harmonizing with chaos—is signaled early and tightens when mare’s tails fracture into Razor Squall signature. Kai’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t flee but *dubs* rhythm onto violence, narrowing options to precise strikes timed to wave impacts. Cost is unmistakable: physical exertion (“breathing heavily”), the risk of splintering sanctuary, and the mental toll of channeling chaos. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shift—from frantic whispers to concerto—reweighting destruction as collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the watchers’ warning—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: studying logs, recognizing visual music, translating light to sound. The cost is conceptual and existential: learning their doom was inevitable, the gate sealed against them. The final deepening (the map revealing the Maw) forecloses hope and redefines his mission, with the cracked whistle embodying irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—truth versus peace—is signaled early and tightens when Aris links their society to Ashworth’s collapse, transforming abstract risk into imminent structural failure. Elara’s agency drives the climax: her renunciation of the lie is earned by Aris’s causally linked argument, not coincidence. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—the end of a century’s foundational myth—and the deepening reweights peace as fragility, though the escalation hinges slightly more on rhetoric than physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving interlaced absence—is signaled early and tightens when the rogue current forces Elias to choose between saving the inkwell or abandoning his archive. His agency drives escalation: he risks drowning to retrieve it, transforming passive witnessing into active salvage. Cost is unmistakable—scraped knuckles, breathless panic—and alters his final action (renewed tenderness in sealing). Coincidence (rogue current) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory is wrested through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned narrative—is signaled early and deepens when the “water damage” proves intentional. The blackout escalates pressure by removing distractions, not solving problems; Elias’s agency drives the turn (fetching stamp, repositioning for light). Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he inherits a lifetime of corrective labor. Minor flaw: stakes remain internalized without external consequence threat, slightly muting tension under a purely Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving grief shape—is signaled early and tightens through Kaelen’s ascent: each step intensifies torment but also clarifies purpose via gem polishing. The meaningful deepening occurs at the basilica, where the dream reweights loss from absence to legacy. Cost is unmistakable: he must endure the “luminous torment” of a promise forever unfulfilled. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—locating where unused potential pools—is signaled early and deepens via perturbation theory into a cosmic theft framework. Escalation is driven by Amal’s agency: refining boundary conditions under time pressure, feeding grief into equations. The meaningful tightening occurs when the array fails, forcing her to work within cooling breakers—a constraint that shapes tactics and culminates in the resonance discovery. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices system stability for metaphysical truth, crystallizing her hunt’s new vector.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s physical strain (“knuckles white,” drone whining) to pull the handle. Agency is clear: she chooses to follow the schematic, power the console, engage motors. Cost is felt in bodily tension and years of lonely pursuit crystallized in one act.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering Anya’s erased existence—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: his method (sifting carvings) leads directly to the revelation. The escalation is a single, devastating deepening: not death, but total excision. Cost is unmistakable—his guilt transforms into purpose, but Anya remains unrecoverable. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening that forecloses forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—successful prisoner exchange amid fragile diplomacy—is signaled early and tightens via the moon-phase protocol, which narrows timing and demands trust. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he initiates the keying ritual, foreclosing deception. Cost is felt in the boy’s shivers and Kaelen’s tremor, but stakes remain narrowly personal rather than politically expansive. No coincidence resolves conflict; every turn stems from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling heart (sea) and action (land)—is signaled early and tightens when Elias sees the young couple’s certainty, triggering his involuntary pull toward the water. The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses to hold the compass over the sea, narrowing options: he can no longer hide behind utility poles. Cost is felt in his “flickering faith” and the phantom helm’s weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming moral agency through empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reveals his past harm wasn’t abstract but personal (“shattered someone’s world”). The tightening occurs at the fissure: turn back or descend. His choice forecloses sterile peace, paying the price of re-engaging pain. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (classified digits) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he deciphers and acts. Cost is legible in the final “fragile spark,” earned through exposure to beauty and guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging a soul-bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s reluctant metamorphosis, which forecloses his humanity. The tightening occurs when he chooses to accelerate transformation despite fear, trading human form for cosmic intimacy. Cost is legible: “the last of his resistance crumbled” as scales replace skin. Agency drives escalation—grinding spices, inhaling memories—and the final stance crystallizes not as rescue but coexistence, with stakes paid in flesh and self.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming presence amid maternal loss—is signaled early and tightens when the birthday ritual fails, forcing ascent to the glade. The deepening occurs when Elara abandons divination (her professional identity) for direct action (tracing her hand), narrowing options from cosmic search to earthly vow. Cost is visible: she forfeits the star-woven cloak (symbol of her cartomancer role) and accepts that time cannot be recovered. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—opening the dimension through compassion, not violence—is signaled early and deepens via each photo’s emotional toll. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to absorb pain, risking collapse, and her method narrows options (only acceptance works). Escalation peaks with her own childhood photo, where failure means cosmic silence. Cost is visceral (deck-buckling weight) and conceptual (bearing humanity’s last tears).

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding transformation) tightens when Kael abandons his plan for the conch shell—a credible pivot that forecloses his original path. The deepening occurs as fireflies activate glyphs, escalating pressure toward the volcano’s response. Agency drives escalation: his release of bugs, not luck, fulfills the prophecy. Coincidence complicates (alignment timing) but doesn’t resolve; cost is felt in relinquished bottles and irreversible ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silent revolution versus authoritarian control—is signaled early and tightened through Kael’s high-risk unlock sequence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his calm defiance crystallizes under blackout-induced chaos. Cost is unmistakable: success hinges on perfect execution amid panic, with failure meaning death or worse. The blackout isn’t just atmosphere—it compresses time and amplifies tension, forcing immediate, irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the bluff’s patterns—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when the vision reveals total erasure. Kael’s agency escalates from observation (placing stones) to intervention (star dust), narrowing options: use Elara’s last resort or lose everything. Cost is felt in physical strain, eel panic, and irreversible expenditure of the dust. Luck complicates (aurora timing) but doesn’t resolve—the harness succeeds through his design.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding scars—is signaled early and deepens when the envelope yields not words but tools for action. The sixty-minute timeframe forces agency: Elias must prepare, then choose. Escalation is protagonist-driven—he winds the timer, waits, interprets the flash-lit negative—and cost is felt: tranquility dissolves into fury, then resolve. The key doesn’t solve; it demands new risk, making stakes visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resolving Elara’s challenge on predetermined fate—is signaled early and tightens via Kaelen’s escalating physical engagement with the sundial. His agency drives escalation: each lunge/parry tests a coded angle, narrowing future possibilities as the sun moves. Cost is visible in the exacting precision demanded and the irreversible shift from contemplation to action. Coincidence never resolves; success hinges on his interpretive skill and embodied discipline under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding meaning from anarchy—is signaled early and tightens when drifters arrive, forcing Silas to risk trust over solitary penance. Agency drives escalation: his choice to read the poem aloud crystallizes stance under pressure. Cost is felt in the trembling hands and raspy voices; safety is traded for connection. The deepening isn’t external threat but internal shift—from “cathedral of decay” to shared shelter—earned by prior ritualized labor.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with her before reality collapses—is signaled early and tightens via the flickering compasses, which narrow navigational options. Elian’s agency drives escalation: his choice to treat the film as a map (not memory) deepens the conflict, transforming passive grief into active rebellion. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his refuge (the arbor), his instrument (piano), and the symbolic anchor (clock) to pursue uncertain reunion. The ticking timeframe (“until the horizon invites night”) forces urgency without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory before monsoon—tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her shift from charting dreams to singing them forecloses her empirical method (visible cost: abandoning instruments). The monsoon clock forces a decisive turn, and the final act crystallizes her stance. No coincidence resolves conflict; success stems from her reinterpretation of dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief without Elara—is signaled early and deepens when Kenji deciphers the lace as instructions. His agency drives escalation: choosing to carry the compass to the bluff triggers the needle’s shift, which in turn enables emotional diffusion. Cost is unmistakable: he trades acute guilt for melancholic acceptance, altering his relationship to memory. Coincidence (wind shifting tide) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his action precedes the compass’s response.
