  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening as the dust lens reveals increasingly intimate patterns of decay and renewal. The orchid-to-weed observation creates the decisive tightening that forces Aris's stance crystallization, with clear cost in surrendering his protective detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: from passive sifting to active dawn watching to deliberate path-tracing. The revelation about the smugglers' mistaken observation provides adequate stakes. Cost is legible in her months of lost work and the terror she must transform, though the antagonistic pressure could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from attempting to perceive the flower's bloom to confronting unbidden trauma memories, with the protagonist actively choosing to weave terror and beauty together rather than retreat. The cost manifests in physical exhaustion and emotional toll. One meaningful deepening occurs when past trauma intrudes and must be integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (ending the psychic noise) escalates cleanly from personal torment to active solution, with the lens discovery tightening options to one dangerous path. The cost is legible in "crushing depth," the talent's "immense cost," and the physical pressure manifestation. The resolution directly addresses the established conflict with earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from basic survival through mysterious benefaction to community renewal, with the bell discovery forcing Elara to choose between safety (staying hidden) and growth (public declaration). The final offering of seeds rather than food confirms the donor's approval while raising new stakes of sustainability. Pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens with meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The breathing cycles create escalating pressure through clarity/mystery alternation, with the kwan yin's tear "humming with faint, internal luminescence" marking intensification. Cost is visible in the "shuddering exhalation" and final tears, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to existential threat as memories progressively dissolve—first edges ghosting, then faces blurring, finally complete dissolution threatened. The fragment's consumption of time creates mounting pressure through concrete losses (wife's face becoming "a blur, her voice a wash of static"). Elias's agency drives the climactic choice to weaponize the maze's geometry against the fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from the arrow's arrival through key decoding to the activated defense system, with each beat narrowing Elara's options under time pressure from approaching enforcers. The cost is legible as she trades her potential freedom to buy time for allies, though the enforcers' threat could be more viscerally immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of specific absences ("silence where his father's praise should have been") building toward the forge sequence. The temporal pressure of "cells divide" creates urgency, though the internal nature of the conflict limits external opposition. The cost lands viscerally in the "grinding glass and tearing silk" of heartbreak made audible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from material (stealing a Holbein) to metaphysical (capturing possibility itself), with Silas's agency driving the shift through his interpretation of the flower code. The cost is legible when his entire collection of portraits becomes "flat" and "inert" - a genuine loss of his previous purpose. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds effectively from internal discovery (bookmark) to external crisis (structural failure) that forces immediate choice between completing her art or survival. The irony that melting threatens both renewal and destruction creates genuine tension with visible cost in the abandoned glass sphere.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from identity crisis to survival as Julian arrives to "erase" evidence. The decryption under time pressure with headlights approaching creates meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in Leo's acceptance of his constructed nature to defeat his creator. One clear reversal when Leo chooses not to flee but to trap.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on completing the ritual map before the last star vanishes. Pressure accumulates through the deepening silence descriptions and the star's flickering countdown, appropriate for the textural lens. Limited dramatic escalation—the conflict remains primarily philosophical rather than visceral, with no significant obstacles or reversals to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from ignoring to destroying to interfacing with the violin across loops, with each failed attempt informing the next strategy. The stakes crystallize when Unit 734 risks "system failure and data corruption" for understanding. Cost is visible in the cascade of warnings, though the emotional weight of risking self-destruction could be heightened.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure - each ticket deepens the mystery until Elias must act (leaving his post for the first time in a decade). The cost is visible in his vulnerability and her tear. Pattern-breaking (speaking vs silence) creates the turn effectively under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes crystallize early (tenure vs automation) with meaningful escalation through the statistical tie to butterfly arrival. The cost is legible—Elias risks everything on his method. Minor issue: the butterflies' arrival, while thematically earned, borders on convenient resolution despite being framed as the garden's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build through the narrowing window of planetary stillness and Elias's role as the steady hands Aris needs. The tension peaks at the lever pull with genuine uncertainty, though the resolution's quiet revelation lacks the visceral cost that higher bands demand.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from passive study ("frustratingly incomplete") to active disruption ("too passive, too reverent") to decisive action. The cost is clear—destroying the antique program to receive its message. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes "the spirit wasn't just in the water-damaged paper, it was in the water itself."

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation reads as density increase perfectly suited to the accumulative lens: from physical recovery to approaching the desk to discovering the smudge to recognizing her own complicity. The cost—permanent suspension between two truths—is unmistakable in "she could not bear it."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal confession to confronting spectral accusation ("They thought I was part of the catastrophe"). The valve wheel moment creates genuine pressure where protagonist must act despite fear. Cost lands in both physical exhaustion and emotional transformation - knowing they can carry their burden.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    The pressure builds effectively from general weight to the specific breaking point of Aeridor's "symphony of seawater and screams." The escalation from bearing stories to being unmade by them works under the textural lens. The temporary resolution acknowledges its own insufficiency, maintaining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether Lena can transform sixty years of defining grief into something that includes wonder. The eclipse creates natural escalation through its phases, with pressure tightening as "the world held its breath." The cost is legible when Lena's "desperate" grip becomes "tender, protective"—she hasn't lost the pain but has reconfigured its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the diary discoveries from geological wobble to psychological effects ("My dreams are... thin") to the final revelation about severed archetypal connection. The progression follows the accumulative lens effectively, though agency is limited to discovery rather than decision. The cost becomes clear in Kaelen's realization that he cannot restore imagination, only archive its absence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from receiving the microdot request through orchestrating the exchange to Elias choosing to leave, with each fortune cookie narrowing the path toward the meeting. The "discordant music" needing retuning provides clear pressure. Cost becomes visible when Elias abandons his typewriter and role, though the middle orchestration lacks a complicating reversal that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through rhetorical questioning that systematically unravels the entity's logic. The tightening occurs as Alistair's layered sound creates "glitch in the entity's perfect, monotonous rhythm." Cost appears in Elara's physical release and the entity's philosophical defeat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from practice (fortune cookies) through personal mapping to the final performance's exhaustion deadline. The dawn's arrival creates genuine time pressure, forcing Kaelen to find "the boundless, ignorant optimism" memory with his last strength. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and the foreclosed possibility of future attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through deepening understanding—from seeing the tablet as map to recognizing it as algorithmic codex, then realizing he must retrace not physical but foundational steps. The cost becomes legible when accepting the memory dissolves his fractured selves but removes his defining ability.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as vibrations build from floor to blood to chest, creating shared tactile language that "bypassed the ears entirely." The progression from individual numbness to collective resonance shows clear escalation under textural lens. Cost is visible in the audience's physical responses, though agency reads more as facilitation than decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal unease (being followed) through mystery (impossible weather data) to commitment (abandoning solitude for investigation). The cost—sacrificing his "bastion of solitude"—is legible but could be more viscerally felt. The lateral thinking solution demonstrates agency, though the emotional price of leaving safety deserves sharper dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from cautious entry to UV experiment to flower blooming to scent recognition. The dominant stake—understanding why scents trigger tears—tightens as each revelation narrows his emotional options. The cost manifests physically in tears and emotionally in accepting "the beautiful impact of memories" rather than defending against them.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—choosing between collective consciousness or pruned individuality—is signaled early through Elias's pattern observation. Escalation occurs through the Lumin's appearance and proposition, with Elias's recognition that it's "not a choice at all" providing the key deepening. The cost of remaining "in the doorway" to observe both states is made legible, though the conflict could press harder through more embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation occurs through deepening discovery—from single note to arpeggio to full conversation with the remnants—each step revealing new acoustic possibilities. The cost manifests physically ("played until her arms ached") and emotionally ("heart was full"), though the stakes could intensify more sharply in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build through textural accumulation—from sensing the petal's charge to absorbing both halves of memory to the final separation. The dominant stake (crafting the half-truth) tightens when Kael realizes "to want one without the other was to want a flower without roots," forcing his sacrifice, though escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake - honoring silent contributors - escalates cleanly from curiosity to understanding to action, with Elias's "emotional risk" calculation showing clear agency. The revelation about David transforms abstract appreciation into concrete action with visible cost (the grant fund). One meaningful tightening when Alina's story crystallizes Elias's motivation is perfectly scaled for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of belonging intensifies through the search sequence where Kaelen must risk visibility to participate. His pointing toward the fissure represents agency that "pushed him past his own shyness." The cost manifests in his abandoning personal art for communal service, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between remaining separate versus risking rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal observation to city-wide threat as "the giant's nap was the only thing protecting the Aerie from shattering into ruin." The tightening occurs when Elias realizes he must use the Chronovore's own method, shifting from passive observation to active intervention. Cost is legible in the risk of waking the giant and the dissolution of the Chronovore.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: from silence to tactile tracing to channeling emotion to light projection. The deepening from raw pain's "jagged edges" to "swirling, softer lines" shows genuine transformation with visible cost in accepting the void's permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Elias's routine archaeology to the desperate urgency of preserving Anya's family history, with the outage creating time pressure. His gamble placing the fragment "directly on her closed laptop" demonstrates agency with clear cost—he risks exposure to save her work.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads as density increase from physical struggle with trellis to recognition of vine's adaptation to final decision to clear rather than repair. The cost manifests in surrendering his professional identity as one who "imposes order."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from artistic desperation through physical journey to the charged moment of exchange. The woman's appearance creates genuine pressure—will he keep or surrender the brooch? The "exchange" crystallizes as he trades physical artifact for narrative meaning, with clear cost in relinquishing the tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from protecting the Heartstone through the cave's increasing unpredictability to Lyra's realization of her misunderstood purpose, with cost in her lost clairvoyance. The cave's agency drives pressure through shadow communications and guided paths. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though Kael's minimal resistance slightly weakens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on whether fragments can restore meaning to the shattered city, tested when the woman's recognition validates Kaelen's work. The tightening occurs through her transformation from weariness to resolve, though escalation remains gentle. Cost appears in the "failed heroism" and broken trumpet, but pressure could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from finding the fortress to understanding his role as keeper, with the punch serving as key that demands acceptance of responsibility. The "first lock" moment effectively tightens pressure. However, the fortress section lacks active opposition - truths simply appear rather than requiring struggle or sacrifice to access.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: two days of futile study, then the storm intensifies both whale songs and emotional state, leading to near-destruction of the tile before breakthrough. The dominant stake—completing his grandmother's work to properly memorialize her—faces genuine test when frustration nearly makes him destroy the key. Cost is visible in his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating density—from anticipation through active manipulation to the rift's opening. The amulet's resistance creates genuine opposition, its "cold, possessive energy" fighting back. Cost is visible in leaving behind everything for true unknowing, though the middle lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from abstract debt-balancing to concrete life-saving through corpse impersonation. The pressure tightens when Elara must use her father's dishonest tools, forcing her to become what she opposed. Cost is visible in "the most dishonest thing she had ever done."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving texture against silence—intensifies through the dawn ritual's narrow window where artificial and natural light create the refraction moment. Agency manifests as focused attention and translation skill. The cost is clear: isolation and the weight of being sole cartographer of imagined histories.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering texture of memories through layering—deepens when the woman's grief adds "vibrant color" to the collection. Escalation occurs through accumulation as fragments coalesce with increasing pressure until the ship's horn breaks the construction. The cost is legible in the return to "silence and the quiet slap of water."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake - decoding Thorne's discovery - escalates through precise calibration of the cello's frequency until it "locks in," creating the ephemeral compass. The tightening occurs when Elias must accept a private truth over public validation. Cost is clear: forsaking "grant proposals and television appearances" for an invisible, lifelong pursuit. Agency drives every beat through Elias's experimental choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from whispered threat through secret reorganization to the inspector's confusion, with clear cost at each turn. The dominant stake (preserving the Revel's soul while surviving gentrification) tightens effectively. Minor deduction for the inspector arriving "weeks ahead" feeling slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal rebellion through chemical timing to the irreversible moment when "the first true ray of sunlight sliced across the summit like a blade." The Flora's instant sublimation forecloses any second chance, making Kaelen's vigil and documentation matter absolutely.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through three horn blasts marking time pressure, from "mournful" to "insistent" to "thunderous." The discovery of the hidden stress fracture deepens stakes beyond the visible tear. Cost manifests in the precision required under mounting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from waiting for atmospheric conditions to witnessing the frost map formation to becoming the "sole archivist" of a cosmic event. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens. The cost—realizing his life's work was misguided—lands clearly though could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: empty footfalls gradually summon "ghosts of sound" until "whispers grew into a murmur," with the apparition of the baker marking a clear intensification. The cost manifests as hours of precise walking and tomorrow's obligatory return. Pressure coheres under the textural lens through density increase rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation coheres beautifully under the accumulative lens as psychic density increases from silence to "maelstrom of sensation" to focused extraction. The oxygen countdown provides coherent external pressure while internal pressure builds through the memory-touching phenomenon. Cost is unmistakable (protagonist's life) and the final trade-off between survival and achievement lands with power.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding truth versus being believed—escalates from seeking story through discovering the impossible to accepting disbelief. The suspension discovery deepens pressure by forcing a choice between preserving the miracle or releasing it. Cost is clear in sacrificing credibility. Missing stronger mid-story tightening that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mysterious presence to dangerous beauty to full revelation. The "lovingly venomous" tension between nurturing and harm creates genuine pressure. The final knowledge transfer carries clear cost - Lyra's dissolution and the weight of "their shared promise" that Elian must now bear alone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to communal transformation, with the dust storm providing genuine threat that forces conscious action. The cost is legible (physical bleeding, risk of total erasure) though the middle section's accumulation of threads lacks the urgency that the storm crisis delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: from wandering to finding the displaced sundial to the multi-day excavation work. The stake of restoring faith deepens when the ship carving transforms understanding, though pressure could tighten more dramatically between finding and freeing the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on creating "a lifeline using discarded threads of the past" for someone never met. The escalation from planning (clipboard) through encoding (chalk) to sending (letter) provides meaningful deepening. However, the absence of immediate opposition or complication keeps tension relatively static - coincidence neither complicates nor resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation—guards not looking at sky, General near comms, blackout as test—narrowing to the three-minute transmission window. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through timing and technical skill, though the immediate physical danger could be more palpable during the transmission sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding "the moment before deciding") established early and deepens through the evocation sequence. The escalation from spirits' murmur to "keening hymn" to message formation creates coherent pressure. Kael's final understanding carries visible cost - not regret for the path taken but painful truth about fear over love.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as each translated symbol increases emotional weight, from "house is quiet" to "honey-cakes" to the General's recognition. The dominant stake—bridging the human cost beneath political positions—tightens when Elias chooses to translate vulnerability rather than intelligence. Cost is visible in the General's defensive erosion and Anja's separation from her mother.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—escalates through the light-painting's fragility where "too much desperation, and the image would flare into an indecipherable white." The fresco fragment's resonance creating the "silent, breathtaking snap" provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in accepting the fleeting nature of remembrance rather than permanent recovery of joy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through Elias's increasing mastery—from random coin flicks to deliberate orchestration of "seven specific structures in a sequence he had meticulously memorized." The stakes deepen from escape desire to curiosity embrace, with the cost visible in his final rejection of "finite answers" for "multitudes."

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual danger (wilting sunflower as silenced voice) to city-wide resistance through the cognitive grid disruption. The approaching sirens create time pressure that forces Kaelen's decision. Cost is visible in the risk of "wiping a dozen city blocks of consciousness."

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into connection through art—deepens as Elara's pain shifts from cage to "space held open just for her," leading to the "blossom armistice" and new verse that carries "reef-shadow joy." The escalation from creating poems of sorrow to poems of "intricate beauty sorrow creates" shows meaningful progression. However, the transformation lacks a concrete triggering event beyond "twin moons cast a shimmering path," slightly weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake - preserving Simple Trust before extinction - escalates through the ritual's stages: approaching, remembering, humming, lighting. The "beautiful, toxic sadness" deepens as success means acknowledging permanent loss. Cost is legible in "another feeling archived... another piece of the world below lost forever."

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are immediately clear: "restore trust...their last chance, the fragile moment before paths diverge forever." Escalation builds through the dangerous spell-casting where broken vows would "shatter the spell and likely the caster with it." The cost is legible in blood-ink, the risk of destruction, and Elara's guarded arrival ready for goodbye transformed to tentative hope.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of understanding parental silence escalates through concrete discoveries that narrow interpretations. Each revelation (adhesive analysis → chain calibrations → hidden letters) meaningfully tightens options about his father's character. The cost is emotionally legible when Kaelen's hands tremble holding "brittle paper" filled with sacrificial love.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm creates genuine escalation by threatening Lena's compositions, forcing Elias from meditation to frantic action. Anna's steady hand on his ankle during crisis deepens their connection and enables his later vulnerability. Cost is visible in his "raw" voice and the foreclosed path of solitary grief-guarding.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through pattern recognition: spiral discovery → logbook connection → weather system realization → threshold prediction → crossing decision. The dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) tightens as Elian realizes crossing means accepting permanent distance. Agency drives the progression with visible cost in the final acceptance of separation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding belonging before the transport arrives—creates urgency through the sunrise deadline. The tension builds through Elara's skepticism and the risk of Kaelen's theory failing, culminating in the light-jelly revelation that transforms their isolation. The cost manifests as accepting loss rather than seeking replacement, though the pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - understanding why paths disappear - drives consistent pressure through the ticking clock of fading memory. Escalation occurs through narrowing possibilities (predator→storm→arrival) with Kael's "desperate conjecture" representing genuine urgency. The cost appears in the traveler's transformation, though Kael experiences minimal personal cost beyond professional curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as each precisely calculated element compounds—water channel, coin weight, vibration timing—toward the singular moment of illumination. The dominant stake (creating beauty from monotony) tightens as environmental factors must align perfectly. Cost manifests in the art's immediate dissolution, though agency remains entirely with Kael's orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from external prohibition to internal frustration to cosmic transformation, with clear cost in the permanent marking. The shift from observing gaps to becoming "the garden's unmoving center" represents meaningful deepening that changes Kaelen's fundamental state.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - whether to preserve or release his life's work - intensifies through accumulating sensory signals of coming change. The stone-throwing scene deepens understanding and forecloses the option of preservation. Cost is visible in the final acceptance, though the conflict could benefit from one more concrete pressure point before the divination.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—transmitting the cost of "bargained innocence"—deepens through Elias's revelation about the box's journey from perfect to fractured. The split-second choice during the fall creates genuine pressure with visible cost in permanent scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate clearly from monitoring a dying timeline through the pattern creation to the needle's dramatic plunge before recovery—a meaningful deepening that reweights Elara's method from failure to success. The cost appears in "The equation had been spent" and the prior failed attempt that "consumed itself." The tide's arrival creates natural pressure that forces the experiment's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from acoustic mapping to confronting catastrophic guilt through the diary discoveries. The Prometheus revelation deepens pressure—"not a failed solution; it was an accelerant"—forcing Elara's choice between exposure and preservation. Cost is legible in her deliberate return of evidence, though the tightening could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether the painter can "persuade mirrors to show possibilities." The convergence of conditions creates natural pressure, and the magic's temporary nature provides inherent cost. The vignettes of transformed reflections (musician, baker, old man) demonstrate concrete impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from skepticism through the dust ritual to signing, with the "moment fraying" creating genuine tension. The cost is visible in Vorlag's grunt of "profound surrender" and Kaelen's trembling hand. One meaningful tightening through the ritual that forces the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from "distant thunder" to its "expectant rumble" returning as he commits the act, with the egg's dissolution creating irreversible change. The cost is legible in "An entire lineage...was unwritten," though middle tension could deepen further.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear: Elara must complete her decade-long work by adding the judge's echo. The ritual's complexity creates tension through "impossible delicacy" and the risk inherent in "unwinding spiritual afflictions." However, no real opposition threatens the ritual's success—the escalation is more accumulation than contested pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - artistic responsibility versus interpretive freedom - escalates from Elara's accusation through Kaelen's doubt to his decision. The hollow-eyed man crystallizes the ethical cost. However, the conflict remains largely internal without external complication after Elara's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic: each structure builds toward the "culminating knot" as butterflies arrive in diminishing numbers. The dominant stake (honoring the migration's end) tightens through the "sparse, hesitant trickle" that forces Elias to work faster. Cost is visible in the acceptance of ending: "built a soft place for it to land."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through the weaving process as Elian transforms absence (holes) into presence (braided pattern), with clear cost in accepting light over sound. The "hours bled into one another" shows time pressure. Escalation is measured but meaningful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm's escalation from "low moan" to violent shuddering to water at Kael's ankles creates coherent pressure that narrows options to a single moment. His agency manifests through choosing to consume the seal rather than preserve it, accepting drowning for a moment of true presence. The cost is unmistakable: he gains awareness but loses his protective temporal distance as death approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—exchanging "a piece of his soul for a glimpse of its true face"—establishes early and pays off through the star-cloud revelation. Escalation builds through accumulation of ritual details rather than reversals, appropriate to the textural lens. The cost is visible in spending his "lifetime of thrift" and the permanent, isolating nature of his "untranslatable truth," though the lack of genuine obstacles or resistance limits higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Vale's increasing resistance—"recoiled, its energy flickering violently"—forcing reality's distortions to intensify. The stakes crystallize at "the patient had to choose the cure or perish with the disease," with genuine risk of mutual destruction. Cost manifests physically as dimensions grind and the sanctuary tears, though agency remains somewhat abstract in Vale's non-embodied form.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (recreating the father's vision) deepens through the synchronized breathing sequence, with escalation through the frost's transformation from chaos to geometry. Cost is visible in the shattering and the frozen tear, though the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond the inherent impossibility.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from professional failure to generational reconciliation. The crystal's worsening condition creates time pressure, and Elian's frustration with traditional tools forces adaptation. Cost is visible in abandoning his methods and accepting his daughter's philosophy. One meaningful tightening through the tool failure, though additional pressure points would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen's need to understand versus his mandate not to—escalates from observation to active inquiry to transformative realization. Pressure coheres through accumulating paradoxes that drive him from the orchard to bathroom, where his focused consciousness on the cameo yields the breakthrough. The cost is legible in his final state: moving from "bewilderment" to "terrible clarity" that cannot be undone, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from academic pursuit to "the most urgent of rescue missions" with clear cost in negotiating with the Curators. The pressure builds through weeks of matching "floral cryptology to the catalog's omissions" and culminates in the high-stakes confrontation. The final acceptance resonates but could show more immediate tactical cost beyond the "weight on her shoulders."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation through three swatch applications, each deepening the cost as her memories blur with his ("her own recollection wavered"). The stakes intensify from seeking memories to risking identity dissolution ("before her own identity dissolved completely"). Final confrontation with "Ocean's Heart" forces the ultimate reckoning with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about anomaly to risk of destabilizing reality itself through the weaving. The "meticulous act of translation" carries tension as each knot could fail. However, the resolution lacks sufficient resistance - the integration succeeds too smoothly without meaningful complication or near-failure that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (finding quiet) is signaled immediately and pressure tightens through Kaelen's journey deeper into the caves. The moment of conjuring creates genuine risk ("terrifying second, the hum intensified") before resolution. Cost is legible in the physical toll and the earned repose.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to cosmic validation as the century-only alignment approaches, with Elian's wavering resolve ("For a terrifying second, his resolve wavered") creating genuine tension before the final commitment. The cost of generations of silence and isolation lands tangibly when the beacon produces only "a fragile heartbeat against the infinite dark" rather than the old world's blazing pillar.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from curating memory to confronting a fundamental truth about collective trauma, with the storm's energy amplifying the crystals' discordance as the pressure mechanism. Kael's agency drives the discovery through deliberate investigation, and the final choice between revelation and preservation carries clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from general listening to finding the knot to perceiving the wall's pattern, each discovery narrows Kael's understanding. The cost manifests in his acceptance of the "heavy hush" as creative canvas rather than enemy, foreclosing his previous rebellion-through-escape mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure builds through accumulation: silence descends, memory surfaces, observation deepens, understanding crystallizes. The dominant stake (relationship's future) tightens through Elara's tangential processing that reveals the true shape of loss—not ending but transformation. Cost is legible in accepting the departure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through Elian's battle against "contracted muscles and spirit" during ascent, with gravity inversion creating natural time pressure. The trellis silence as "vast, ancient, utterly hospitable" meaningfully deepens his quest, though more visceral cost during descent would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on the woman's fear of silence versus Elian's need to teach comfort through quiet. Escalation occurs through accumulation as Elian reveals increasingly subtle sounds, forcing her to listen differently. The cost is visible in her physical transformation from white-knuckled clutching to relaxed shoulders and deepened breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the layer-peeling sequence, each revealing a failed predecessor's fate, narrowing her options. The dawn deadline creates genuine pressure. The final revelation that the throne needs memory, not a body, reweights everything. Minor deduction for resolved tension dropping slightly after success.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconnecting to save Liam) is signaled early and tightens through Elara's deliberate breach of the boundary she created. The cost is legible: six months of isolation, the "difficult mercy" of cutting him off, now reversed through vulnerable psychic connection. Escalation works under the Accumulative lens as pressure builds from memory to action to breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from discovering the Promise to Elara volunteering to approaching it despite "every instinct screamed at her to flee." The pressure coheres around her choice to channel rather than contain, with visible cost in her "guttural cry born of old rage and new hope." The transformation of pressure into diamonds literalizes the thematic stake effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the dynasty's decline—escalates through the physical intensification of turning the crank until "the hum rising to a pressure that felt as if it could crack glass." The revelation carries clear cost: generations sacrificed their power and influence for safety, with Elara as the culmination. The conflict is primarily internal discovery rather than external opposition, appropriate for this accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes establish early through the greenhouse's dissolution threatening "all potential into a single, dull certainty." Escalation builds through the dance sequence as "the greenhouse fought him" and culminates in the decisive clasp release. Cost is visible in the physical transformation and loss of the theater program, though the resolution could show more immediate trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative discovery: from cataloging routine to noticing discrepancy to uncovering the button to deciphering the message. Each revelation deepens emotional investment, with the final realization about the clerk's empathy forcing Elara to reconfigure her understanding of both historical tragedy and her own grief.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are established early (network silence signals discovery) and escalate through Elara's journey to the dangerous broadcast. The dominant stake—preserving truth against erasure—remains consistent. The cost is visible in her isolation and the risk she takes, though the immediate consequences of the broadcast remain implied rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear - prevent the prophecy from manifesting. Escalation works through the musical duel between coded drips and saxophone notes. The tension deepens appropriately but lacks a sharp reversal or heightened cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: routine sorting→anomalous leaf discovery→monument construction→the prod decision, with stakes crystallizing around the prophecy's fulfillment. The cost manifests in the arbor's transformation from ash to jade, though the personal stakes for Elian could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity (finding cogs) through archaeological discovery to philosophical confrontation with life's purpose. The makeshift compass pivot shows agency under constraint. However, the physical stakes could be higher - the descent lacks genuine danger or sacrifice beyond the philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through the alchemical process as Kael feeds increasingly personal elements into the furnace, culminating in the coin's transformation. The cost is legible in his physical depletion and the irreversible change to the memorial object. The internal stake (accepting loss versus reversing death) tightens through the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from distorted notes to "painful shriek" when Silas first speaks, then resolve through the spirit's recovered laughter memory that untangles the melody. The dominant stake—helping the spirit move on by confessing joy not just pain—tightens when she initially recoils. Cost is visible in her "decades in gray twilight" and the "luminous ache" of Silas's work.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from survival to understanding as Kaelen realizes he must "solve" rather than escape the forest. The bracing sequence shows agency through physical preparation for revelation. The shift from "desperate grip" to "purposeful" hold on the strap marks genuine transformation, though the resolution leans intellectual over visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build from personal mission through discovery of the deliberately wrong painting to the active unfastening of historical lies. The "wrenching pull, not of thread but of reality itself" shows clear escalation with protagonist agency. Cost registers in the transformation of both painting and lens, though middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from routine decommissioning to spectral encounter to moral choice ("engage" vs. "leave the dead to their secrets"). The power cut creates genuine pressure that forces Leo's decision. Cost is visible in the ghost's release and Leo's acceptance of his "weightless burden." Minor deduction as the conflict could push Leo harder between his professional duty and supernatural calling.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: whisper uncorked → frost patterns forming → books trembling → piercing tone → rupture. The dominant stake of breaking perfection for change tightens as each crystalline pattern undermines the library's "foundational mathematics," with the cost visible in the system's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archaeological dispute with Valerius establishes clear intellectual stakes that deepen when the shard reveals the First Ones' humanity. The temporal storm creates natural escalation, forcing Kaelen from passive observation to active interpretation. Cost registers in his acceptance of being called a "sentimental projection of a failed idealist"—a price he's willing to pay for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear dominant stake (saving the world from entropic decay) with meaningful escalation when the rust's voice attacks Elias's confidence, forcing him to choose between grandiosity and humble truth. The cost is visible when the chip dims and nearly fails. One significant tightening that narrows options to success or total failure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen from collecting a scent to confronting the limits of her practice. The psychometry reading forces a choice between easier paths and following revelation. Her decision to leave everything behind shows clear agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: artistic curiosity → understanding the covenant → survival against the wave. The protagonist's agency drives each escalation, and the cost is visible (she's now bound to remember and rebuild). The wave provides external pressure that forces immediate application of her new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—deepens through the methodical exploration of glass layers. Each filter revelation tightens the mystery toward personal inheritance. The escalation through violet, blue, then white light creates accumulative pressure. Slightly limited by the lack of external opposition or complicating forces.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation occurs through Kaelen's tactical shift from interrogating the past (timeline, protest) to exploring consequence (legacy, peace), which finally provokes the antagonist's first response. The cost accumulates through "searing reverie," physical toll, and weeks of isolation. Stakes could be more visceral—the "truth" remains somewhat abstract despite the coordinate payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to civilizational recreation, with each memory costing physical exhaustion. The progression from one lantern to two shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Kaelen's strain, though the middle section could benefit from one more tangible obstacle or reversal to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate effectively from ambient unease to existential threat through Elian's discovery, with the central conflict between preserving emotion (his oath) versus protecting the city crystallizing at closure. The cost is legible in "starve the silence that was coming for them from the deep."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from static inheritance to active decay requiring intervention, with Elara's method of invitation rather than force creating meaningful tension. The cost is preservation effort and accepting the collective weight of lineage, though the physical/emotional toll could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from routine maintenance through discovery of the pattern to the zero-hour decision where system protocols demand obliterating sound. The cost is legible: Elian chooses potential destruction over certainty, trading safety for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation from detached observation to active empathy, with Kael's decision to "feel" rather than just trace marking the key intensification. The cost manifests in his visceral experience of the star's death, though the stakes could sharpen earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Elias's "curdled" quietude through Lyra's "desperate focus" to the revelation that his silence has "chained her here." The deepening from personal guilt to shared burden ("not his burden alone; it was a shared anchor") meaningfully reweights the conflict's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture before Kael's own runs out—intensifies through his desperate garage sale method and culminates when the traveler's message unlocks the silo's purpose. The cost is legible as Kael trades his anxious pursuit for acceptance of preserved moments, though the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming loss into beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen's witnessing. The kite's loss creates genuine pressure that forces his artistic response. However, Kaelen faces no personal risk or cost; he remains a safe observer whose art costs him nothing, limiting the stakes' intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—creating interspecies connection before death—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's weakening body versus his methodical progress. The cost escalates from physical deterioration to ultimate sacrifice. Agency manifests through deliberate, systematic action despite declining strength.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from initial resistance at the trailhead, through "strange, silent imperative" following ghostly footprints, to "prickle of anticipation" entering the tower, culminating in the choice to place the amber. The dominant stake—understanding versus isolation—tightens as Aris must sacrifice his defining skepticism to gain expanded understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (atonement through restoration) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. The birds' guidance creates genuine pressure that narrows his options—"Three paces west" determines action. Cost accumulates through physical toll and the acknowledgment that he cannot resurrect what was lost, only translate it.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate from disappointment at the cylinder's static, through the days of painstaking decoding, to the two-day wasteland journey "leaving the relative safety." The fissure's initial appearance as "nothing" before revealing the pivotal garden creates earned reversal. Cost manifests in Barrow's exhaustion and the risk of leaving settlement safety.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure accumulates through intensifying temporal distortion ("stretched intensified, pulling taut") leading to the vision, with cost visible in Elara gasping and losing physical control. The dominant stake of finding orientation in temporal chaos coheres, though escalation relies heavily on internal description rather than dramatized obstacles or choices that would strengthen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate through physical risk (climbing), discovery risk (Sylas's presence), and the decisive swap moment. The light distraction creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible in Kael's "calloused hands" and the irreversible nature of planting possibility in Sylas's controlled world.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: SECRET → RELEASE → UNBIND, with the Regent's recognition creating genuine tension ("recognizing a performance but unable to discern its script"). The stakes tighten when Elara knows she has "only one more chance before the Regent's benevolent ruthlessness identified her as a threat." Cost manifests in both Elara's exposed grief and the Regent's cracked composure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through Elara's increasingly "frantic, desperate" nightly worlds fighting her singular focus on the stone. The stakes deepen when touching the stone with the feather transforms her relationship to place, though the middle section could tighten between finding the stone and discovering the feather method.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as Elias decodes each thread, with the labyrinth's clicks marking progression. The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens as he isolates "threads of pride from threads of duty." Cost becomes legible in accepting the "simple, defensive move" over brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: whispered poems → growing resonance → final direct challenge at the precipice. The horn's moan creates time pressure, forcing Elara's climactic choice. Cost is legible as she faces capture, having "already won" through her echoing questions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each scar requires deeper emotional excavation, from "shallow chip" to the heart's "deep, star-shaped crater" where Elara's resolve crumbles. The tightening breath and encroaching leviathan shadow force the final choice between abandoning the work or risking everything, with clear cost in nearly failing before the coral charm anchors her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding a place "beautiful enough to hold their forever"—establishes early and deepens through the wrong turn into the oasis. The cost manifests in releasing the painted shell, a "final transference of heat." While pressure doesn't escalate dramatically, it accumulates through narrowing space into expansive release.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through Elias's internal intensification from holding the cork to channeling "the full, silent force of his spirit." The cost manifests in his physical/emotional expenditure. The opposition between Hemlock's failed method and Elias's untested approach creates genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen effectively as Elias moves from passive grief to active construction, with the bronze foot's placement creating irreversible commitment ("clicked into place with an unnerving finality"). The cost manifests in accepting he "hadn't brought his daughter back" while finding "raw solace" in helping others—a meaningful trade-off that forecloses personal reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from general truthfulness affliction to the specific vulnerability of Lena's memory, then tighten during the storm ritual where Elias must provide "the most painful truth" to attune the relic. The final test with the neighbor crystallizes whether the protection worked. Cost accumulates visibly: isolation, entire season's truffle harvest, accepting damaged but holding orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from curiosity to "profound, aching connection" as memories accumulate, with the ocean/mountain parallel providing thematic pressure. The revelation that the stranger came "to let it drown" effectively tightens options. Cost is felt in Silas's "breath hitched" and his recognition of "one less ghost in the world."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rising creek creates genuine temporal pressure ("a liquid clock ticking away his chance"), and Elias's agency drives him through each choice from following ants to entering the cavern to raising the chip. The glimpsed alternate lives create meaningful cost, though the middle section could tighten further between entering the cavern and reaching the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds causally from dreams to climb to grotto discovery, with the hypnotic light forcing Elara's choice between dissolution and duty. The cost is visceral—"the ultimate escape from her disenchantment at the cost of her very soul"—and Kael's physical intervention adds immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael's confession creates the decisive pressure that forces Elara's methodological transformation. The escalation from sterile perfection to living warmth follows the accumulative lens well, with clear cost in abandoning her "rigid spectrum of disciplined experimentation." The stakes of capturing presence versus losing Kael crystallize effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with temporal fracture—deepens through the jealousy sequence and culminates in the flight that shifts perspective. The internal pressure builds from nostalgia to frustration to transcendent acceptance. Limited by the primarily internal nature of the conflict without external pressures that would force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - finding meaning through fragmented perception - tightens as Elara reads the screw's wear patterns into emotional truth. The old man's transformation from "trembling calm" to "weeping, silent tears" shows visible cost. However, the conflict lacks true resistance or complication; the reading proceeds too smoothly without genuine obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from physical affliction through failed runic attempts to the spreading crystallization ("fresh prickle of anxiety"), forcing Elian's choice between scholarly pride and folk wisdom. The cost manifests as surrendering academic certainty. Could benefit from sharper intermediate pressure between setup and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from needing apology to drowning in raw connection to receiving "imperfect absolution" with the orchard's imminent destruction as temporal pressure. The cost is legible in "fractured and painful absolution" and Julian's physical struggle. One meaningful deepening through the ritual's intensity suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: the spiral journey physically narrows while consciousness expands, the dictionary's warped definition reveals cosmic truth, and the boundary between self and silence progressively thins. The dominant stake—whether to maintain individual witness or dissolve into universal consensus—intensifies through each inward step until the final act of letting the book fall.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding what clocks measure) tightens through the ice discovery that forces Elias to choose between correction and witnessing. The escalation follows accumulative logic as details layer ("glacial melt, ancient and freighted") until the final reweighting. Cost appears in accepting the flaw's persistence rather than maintaining perfect function.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (releasing grief through understanding its physics) escalates from observation to invention to action. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through his device. Cost is visible in the "profound exhaustion" and the permanence of the ghosts' departure, though the middle lacks significant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from solving a cipher to mapping "the city's soul" to confronting her entire life philosophy. The pressure coheres through accumulated discoveries that force Aris to abandon statistical thinking. The final message "The only sure thing is a beautiful risk" crystallizes the choice between certainty and meaningful engagement, though the immediate cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing suicide through reframing—intensifies as Silas loops the caller's words, creating mounting psychological pressure. The glass harmonica's "melodically haunted signal" punctuates the conversation's turns, and the caller's gradual shift from whispered despair to stronger observation shows clear escalation. Cost is visible in both the caller's initial pain and Silas's maintained isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving a forgotten truth—escalates from discovering the damaged photo through the dangerous chemical restoration to the revelation of the founders' love story. The jetty's miraculous blooming provides external pressure that forces both archivists to confront their towns' false history. However, the conflict lacks intermediate resistance; Tomas immediately accepts the revelation without skepticism, and the resolution feels slightly too neat given a century of animosity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—curing societal/personal loneliness—is signaled early and tested through Silas's gambit. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of arrivals and the critical moment where "a crowd either becomes a mob or a community." The cost manifests in Silas abandoning his observer role, though the stakes could tighten further if his intervention risked more tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through the accumulation of musical notes, each discovery narrowing Kaelen's path toward the Stillpoint. The progression from "sorrowful F" to "hopeful A-minor" to "resilient G" mirrors his emotional journey. The final note "in the space between things" represents a meaningful deepening that forces him to dowse emptiness itself.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Kaelen's discovery he can edit history, testing changes that reveal worse disasters, culminating in his choice to add a footnote rather than change the past. The cost is palpable—accepting thousands of deaths rather than creating new catastrophes. One meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of revision with clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mapping ordinary silence to confronting the "aggressive presence" at the ferry landing that "pushed back against the moonlight." The deepening occurs as Elian moves from documentation to "arguing, pleading, demanding that the silence give up its dead." Cost manifests in the physical intensity of his "desperate, beautiful ballet" and the emotional weight of giving voice to the forgotten.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries that deepen Kaelen's connection to his sister, culminating in the revelation that she anticipated and incorporated vandalism into her art. The cost is visible in his transformation from destructive rage to creative purpose, though the final beat could tighten the trade-off between revenge and restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's drumming intensification from "hesitant" to "fingers flew faster," with each rhythmic development deepening the manifestation and emotional cost. The tension between creating their shared dream and confronting Leo's absence drives genuine pressure, culminating in the tear that "broke free" as visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from professional challenge to validation of entire methodology, with Kaelen's arrogance providing coherent pressure. The coin flip represents genuine decision point under uncertainty. Cost materializes in Kaelen's visible defeat and the power dynamics shift. Slightly limited by single-beat resolution without deeper personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on teaching "darkness the value of stars" - established early and maintained. Escalation occurs through the pattern-weaving sequence building to the dental mirror's "single brilliant mote" penetrating the depths. The soft luminescence response creates meaningful exchange with emotional cost (loneliness acknowledged).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from the Authority's creativity-as-dissent proclamation through Maya's doubt to the town's collective curiosity awakening. The synchronized displays create genuine risk with visible defiance. Cost is legible in the exposure of personal meaning against Authority decree. Minor deduction for relatively safe resolution without immediate Authority response.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Kaelen's restlessness through Elara's "I don't want to lose you" to the final separation. The scrimshaw's power to "unlock guarded hearts" forces Elara's admission, tightening pressure. Cost is legible in the siblings' permanent separation and Elara's transformation from "combative" to accepting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: theatrical narration → private whittling → placement in bouquet → dropping the performance. The guilt about Mara crystallizes the moral cost. Minor deduction because the physical stakes could be more immediate—we know the consequences exist but don't feel their proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from aesthetic pilgrimage through methodical dissolution to recognition of the colonnade as blueprint rather than chaos. The pressure coheres through accumulative sensory deepening, though the physical/emotional cost could be more visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from artistic expression to life-or-death as Lyra's condition drives the barter. The pressure tightens when the entity demands "a sound that is perfectly whole" in a broken world, forcing creative problem-solving. Cost is visible: Elian abandons his painting to save a life, recognizing this act as his true masterpiece.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through Elian's methodological shift from passive reverence to active experimentation—"questioning assumptions that had guided his entire life's work." The cost manifests in abandoning sonic tradition for visual connection. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes sound must be seen, not heard, forcing a complete reconceptualization.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation - each origami message raises emotional investment until the final reveal transforms grief into connection. The woman's progression from "listlessness" to designing her own pendant shows meaningful change, though her arc could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as Elara maps "contagion" inch by inch, revealing how "caution was abandoned for hype." Julian's transformation from seeking recovery to understanding patterns shows meaningful deepening. The cost lands conceptually but could be more dramatically embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual pursuit to existential transformation as Elara experiences "atoms of nostalgia" bleeding into her. The cost progresses from "anguished joy" to hosting ghosts to complete identity dissolution. Her agency drives every beat through deliberate, unpatterned actions despite knowing the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preserving Elara's essence without destroying her humanity. Escalation builds through Kael's discovery process - from detecting the blight to identifying its source to choosing integration over deletion. The cost is clear but somewhat abstract; the emotional price could be more immediately felt through embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (restoring self-respect while maintaining compassion) deepens through the prosthetic work, but escalation feels internal rather than pressurized. The chameleon's color change provides the meaningful turn. Missing external pressure or meaningful opposition limits the score—the conflict is primarily past-tense (the con) rather than present-scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the tunneling sequence where Elias discovers the procedure's failure—not healing but "perfect, awful preservation of the break." The ivy's panic and withdrawal represents tangible cost, though the middle section's introspection slightly dilutes active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) deepens through psychometric reading that reveals Arthur's ritualistic documentation. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal. The cost lands in Arthur's perpetual separation and the theater's haunted atmosphere, though the pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding mental quiet versus embracing psychic noise—deepens when the meteor's brightness triggers Elara's revelation. The cost of years of isolation ("fifth major shower since the twin-tailed visitor") is visible, though the transformation occurs through insight rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining archive stability to confronting a memory "too sharp for this soft, broken age" that threatens reality's fabric. The cost is legible in Kaelen's violated dreamlessness and the world's permanent alteration, though the physical threat could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding his condition) escalates through sensory accumulation from disorientation to the "hum of insight" to final comprehension. The cost of accepting his role as witness/balance is legible. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won through genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of finding courage after liberation escalates through the guides' test—not granting passage but "confirming readiness to choose it." The ticket punch moment creates meaningful pressure that forces Elara's realization. Cost is visible in the foreclosed past ("the world behind her was now a country of ghosts") and the solitary forward path.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from Elias's damaged nerves to revealed guilt about the accident, to daily confrontation with the victim, culminating in his decision to reveal the bolt. The cost is legible in "letting the cold...seep into him, a frostbite that felt like clarity." One meaningful deepening that reweights all prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: centuries of preparation → final component needed → rune activation → pretender's unraveling. The "pause of shifting constellations" creates temporal pressure. Cost is clear (Kael's dissolution), though the conflict lacks immediate opposition or complication beyond the methodical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating rhythmic attempts, environmental confluence, and the discovered spiral notation, narrowing to the final successful summoning. The cost (years of isolation, accepting periodic rather than permanent access) is legible. Minor deduction for the convenience of the environmental alignment timing.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the hum layers into "something immense and physical," with clear cost in the transition from personal to planetary stakes. The single meaningful deepening from individual discovery to collective awakening satisfies scope requirements, though agency could be tested more severely.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—introducing resilience versus compliance—is signaled early and tightens as Elara manipulates the environment through increasingly precise actions. The ritual sequence escalates from passive observation to active orchestration, with each step narrowing the path to success. Cost is visible in the irreversible nature of the unsealing, though pressure could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The plane's shadow creates immediate physical paralysis that escalates through memory to the photograph's tactile presence. Anya's grounding technique shows agency through attention rather than action. The cost is viscerally felt in her body's rebellion and the effort required to return to function.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres through the lighthouse's suffocating compression that drives Elias to "descend into necessary darkness," with the broken tarot box catalyzing his shift from passive suffering to active redesign. The transformation from crushing walls to "silent witnesses" demonstrates earned agency, though the middle section could tighten the pressure-to-action causality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering why time slows) escalates from observation to active pursuit through the disappearing ink ritual. Kael's choice to abandon rescue efforts for his hunt shows clear trade-off. The drone's increasing whine and closer approach creates pressure, though more intermediate tightening would strengthen the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from archival duty through moral discovery to active sedition, with the ticking pressure of the Council's impending purge forcing immediate action. The "blink that follows surprise" timeframe creates urgency, and Elara's choice forecloses her entire professional identity with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from tending plants to confronting violent inheritance when the forgotten knife forces choice. The physical weight of the weapon ("unnaturally heavy") and phantom scents create pressure, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through density increase as cosmic chaos intensifies ("constellation Lyra sent a shockwave"), forcing Kaelen to adapt his path through the "frantic zigzag." The cost becomes legible when achieving his goal dissolves the echo "back into the quiet it was born from" - success and loss unified.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through Celeste's three-part logical trap, each question tightening the noose around Davies's false narrative. The dominant stake—exposing truth versus protecting reputation—crystallizes when she reveals the letter. Cost is visible in her father's decades of bearing false guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from internal guilt-hum to discovering letters about Lyra, to confronting her digitized voice crying endlessly. The amber's dual function as memory-object and tool for resolution creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible when "The hum inside him ceased" after the etching ritual completes.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning in collective silence) escalates from personal unease to communal action. The pressure deepens when Elara recognizes the same "lilac unease" in others, forcing her artistic intervention. However, the opposition remains somewhat abstract—no concrete obstacle tests her resolve beyond internal doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing suffering to active intervention to the moral weight of identity erasure, with clear cost in Kaelen's accumulating psychic burden and the Retro's complete loss of self. The tension between mercy and violation creates genuine pressure, though the resolution lacks resistance from the Retro.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as Julian layers increasingly powerful echoes, from gentle warmth to culminating applause that "shattered" Elara's despair. The dominant stake (preventing tragedy/achieving meaningful encore) tightens as Julian expends "all of his spectral energy" in the final push. Cost registers in both Julian's expenditure and Elara's transformation from despair to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from testing a theory to validating their entire relationship's foundation. The two experiments tighten pressure—first matching grief, then proving the static shock connection. Cost is legible when Elias's "skepticism wavered, a hairline crack" leading to full acceptance. Minor deduction for relatively gentle pressure that could push harder toward irrevocable change.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mapping absence to participating in consciousness merger, with clear cost in surrendering analytical control. The deepening from observation to participation drives the accumulative pressure effectively. The physical levitation and consciousness expansion create tangible risk with earned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the prophecy represents inescapable fate or changeable warning—intensifies as the hourglass empties, creating temporal pressure. Kaelen's agency drives the escalation through his methodical cataloging that transforms chaos into clarity, with each button placement extracting clearer voices from the jar. The cost becomes legible when the final button reveals the path not taken, and Kaelen must choose between duty (turning the hourglass) and possibility (delivering new knowledge), with the city's fate hanging in the balance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal redemption to active rescue mission with the revelation "She's alive" creating genuine reversal. The Vienna network closing in adds time pressure. Cost is visible in Elias's transformation but could be more visceral at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the broken promise—signals early and deepens through the palimpsest metaphor. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for this textural approach. The bell announcing the ferry creates a gentle but effective pressure point. However, the conflict remains largely internal without external complication, and the resolution feels perhaps too neat for thirty years of guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to physical commitment as Kaelen abandons sustenance to rebuild the channel. The dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—deepens through each act of care that reveals more of the past. Cost is visible in his exhaustion and the "profound silence" that follows completion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reaching someone in isolation—intensifies through Elara's nightly exhaustion and the risk of her vulnerability going unacknowledged. The window opening by "a fraction of an inch" is a meaningful tightening that forecloses easy connection while affirming her method. Cost is visible in her physical tiredness and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into independence—deepens through the stone circle sequence where memories shift from "brittle shards" to beings that are "simply being." The cost becomes visible when Kael accepts his solitude as preservation rather than punishment. Could benefit from more intermediate pressure between setup and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (connection vs isolation) escalates through witnessing others' contributions, building pressure that forces Elara's choice between keeping her talisman or joining the collective work. The cost is clear: "severing her last link" versus remaining "just an archivist of affection." Minor deduction as the pressure could tighten more actively through the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from passive observation to active intervention, with clear cost: Elara risks exposure and takes on endless vigilance. The "virulent transmission" correlating with the town hall collapse raises urgency, and her decision "settled not with a crash but with the quiet finality of a closing airlock" shows agency forcing the turn. The tricksters' arrogance creates genuine opposition that Elara must outwit.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds effectively from passive disorientation to active spatial rebellion when the organ "enraged" the nexus, forcing Elias to his "precipice" moment. The protagonist's agency drives resolution through deliberate action (aiming the compass point), with clear cost in confronting his deepest fear.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (awakening empathy) escalates through accumulating artistic oppositions until the violent scratch creates the breakthrough moment. Cost is visible in the "sharp, aching sorrow" and the permanence of leaving the painting "to stare into the fog." The tension between methodical process and desperate need creates authentic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal vindication to exposing a century-long conspiracy about a hidden continent. The pressure tightens as each discovery narrows Elias's path toward confronting the Guild. The cost is visible—Eva's erasure from history and the weight of reversing it—though the final confrontation happens off-page via "secure channel" rather than dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing impossibility to choosing whether to pursue it, with the glass shard forcing Elias to confront undeniable evidence. The cost is clear - abandoning his familiar life of "never" for dangerous possibility - though the conflict could benefit from more immediate physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from surveyor intrusion through worker unease to CEO confrontation, with Elias's territorial markers effectively narrowing the startup's options. The psychological warfare deepens from visual (clown mask) to auditory (music box) to symbolic (currency symbols). Cost is visible in the startup's collapse, though Elias's agency in their market downturn feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to resolve generational burden—with meaningful deepening when Elian discovers the glyphs are "a lament" rather than historical record. The cost is legible in his transformation from "frantic energy" to "profound and enveloping calm" as he accepts the burden's true nature. The escalation through stellar observation to dream-state revelation coheres well under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes clear from opening - finding the frozen confession. Escalation through three expanding circles of perception builds pressure effectively. The cost manifests as Elara's fortress walls "trembling" and finally unbending. Minor deduction as the external opposition is static rather than adaptive.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through Kael's warning of the "beautiful trap" forcing Elara to pivot her approach, with the maze clipping becoming "a burning ember of certainty." The stakes tighten from general searching to avoiding a specific false path, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the complication.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds causally from recognition of shadow to panic to resolution through sacrifice. The protagonist's agency drives the turn - offering his academy memory as "balm" rather than bargain. Cost is legible in the permanent loss of his brightest moment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from inventory task to existential question of "anything of value left," with the physical struggle against the snagged cloth operating as external manifestation of internal resistance. The tightening occurs when pulling the cloth free causes his "facts as shield" to crumble, forcing confrontation with suppressed memory.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—proving their shared belief in "an ordered, knowable existence"—escalates from passive grief to active inquiry through the seed-planting decision. The tightening occurs when Elara shifts from seeking Kael's return to understanding "the principle he had become," foreclosing the path of simple resurrection. Cost is visible in the transformation from "agonizing torment" to measured anticipation, though the resolution could benefit from one more beat of active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative intensification as tide rises and Kaelan transforms, with the smelting act as meaningful deepening. The internal conflict between rigid order and transformative fire creates authentic tension. Cost is legible in the pain accepted during smelting, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: silence→discovery→understanding→hesitation→decisive action. The dominant stake (connection vs isolation) tightens when Elias must choose between his oath and "the desperate, foolish dream of a world made whole again." Cost is legible but the middle lacks active pressure - mostly contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early with meaningful deepening through the graffiti discovery that reweights his understanding. The accordion's wheezing notes represent acceptance rather than resolution. Cost is legible in abandoning the father's instrument, though the graffiti's arrival lacks causal buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of decoded phrases building toward the central chamber's revelation. The time pressure between letters creates urgency. Slight deduction because the "second letter" threat remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear escalation from comfortable complicity to moral crisis through the vine's memory and coffee prophecy convergence. The stake of "authenticating these elegant brutalities" tightens when Elias must choose between prestige and truth, with visible cost in abandoning his career. The "fertile pang of planting something true" shows the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of capturing "one last spark before the end" is signaled early and tightens through Elara's focused search for "the one true note" amid cosmic static. The pressure deepens as she narrows focus to extract the specific memory, with visible cost in the soul's complete dissolution, though additional complication could strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Heart-Bloom's failing cycle creates genuine pressure that forces Elara from observation to intervention. The stakes deepen when she must choose between traditional non-interference and active participation. Cost is visible in abandoning old methods, though the resolution feels slightly smooth without stronger resistance or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from internal tremor to brass chimes' "sharp metallic clang" (certainty fighting back) to the decisive cloak removal. The wind chime system externalizes and intensifies internal pressure effectively. Cost is visible in Kaelen's shivering vulnerability and the image of his wealth "fallen king's banner" on the rocks below.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through Kael's frustration with Elara's teaching method to the trance sequence where his desire to find his sister is revealed as the very thing preventing him from learning. The ripples reversing creates meaningful escalation, and the cost—releasing his desperate grip on his goal—is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - learning to navigate without moving - deepens when the discordant pulse threatens the canyon's harmony. Escalation occurs through discovery, bird-reading, and harmonic resolution, each narrowing Kaelan's options toward intervention. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative diagnostic failures, each overload tightening pressure until the pack's removal. The dominant stake—finding value in simplicity versus automated complexity—manifests through tool failure forcing methodology change. Cost becomes visible when Kael abandons his "advanced education" literally and figuratively.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: surface ritual→descent→navigation→deliberate darkness, with each stage narrowing options toward the singular act of floating in silence. The cost is legible in "exhausted and calm" and "for the first time in ten years, it was not empty." Agency manifests as deliberate renunciation of light to find sound's color.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from interpreting static to risking total sensor burnout on the stubborn pulse. The coin ritual creates genuine decision point with consequences. Cost manifests in dissolving "stellar doubt" and accepting his transformed purpose—years of forward-seeking work recontextualized as backward-looking.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief into bearable form—intensifies through the replay of Elara's voice and the pressure of sunset's deadline. The deepening occurs as abstract need becomes concrete action through the prism. Cost is visible in accepting permanent heartbreak rather than healing: "a scar given form."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation occurs through the accumulative weight of 97 days building to the moment of understanding—"something shifted." The cost is legible in Kael's depleted magic and the time invested. The shift from adjusting drip speed to understanding the silence between drops creates meaningful deepening that changes his approach and succeeds where repetition failed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from measuring drought to recovering family honor, with each photograph discovery narrowing Elias's options toward confronting the false narrative. The final choice to correct the record carries real risk to his position as levee warden. The accumulative pressure builds effectively though one middle beat feels slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear escalation from analytical frustration through desperate observation to transformative action. The stake (harmonizing logic and intuition) tightens when the starlings point to the overlooked tree. Cost becomes visible in releasing analytical control. However, the final transformation lacks immediate dramatic tension - the vapor's effect feels predetermined rather than risky.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from pattern detection to the realization of colony danger to the trembling hand threatening to shatter the crystal dial. The muscle memory solution is earned through prior setup, and agency drives the resolution. Cost is visible in physical tension and the "hollow ache" aftermath, though the immediate external consequences remain implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The clone custody battle escalates from verbal disagreement to Jin's attempted interference to Kael's decisive action, with clear cost in draining sensation and new responsibility. Kael's agency drives the vivification against Jin's opposition. The stakes tighten once as Jin moves to physically intervene, forcing immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mystery deepens through orthogonal investigation approaches, creating intellectual tension. The revelation about Finch and the "patience is the lock and the key" callback provides meaningful tightening. However, the stakes remain primarily cerebral without visceral pressure; Elias faces no real opposition or cost beyond time commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes clear from opening: breaking the "silence so dense it felt like a physical weight." The ghost's struggle to start the leaf blower (three pulls with increasing desperation) provides meaningful escalation under the textural lens. Cost is legible in both the ghost's depleted state and the family's pained recognition—particularly the wife's "pained, fragile smile."

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pendant's temptation escalates from "cold weight" to "humming temptation" to the portal's violent opening, effectively tightening pressure. Lyel's agency drives the resolution when he actively pours his longing into the pendant to close the portal. The cost is legible in his acceptance of continued exile, though the stakes could be sharpened by showing what specifically the library protects.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation of failures (72 attempts) with each destroying irreplaceable relic fragments, raising cost. The final stake—using the shepherd's crook itself—represents ultimate commitment. The reversal from forcing to surrendering emerges from protagonist insight with visible price paid (entire crozier dissolved), though middle attempts could vary more distinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - finding the shard of hush - escalates through methodical pressure as Elara discards three assumptions sequentially, each raising the risk ("tower groaned...threatening to overwhelm her system"). The cost manifests in the dangerous energy levels during perigee's zenith, though the resolution feels somewhat predetermined once she commits to the new method.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds causally: discovery of displacement → recognition of patterns → understanding of parallel timelines → active merger attempt. The dominant stake (escaping the temporal rift) tightens as Finn realizes he must merge timelines rather than simply escape. Cost is visible in his permanent awareness burden.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to existential trap as the memory shift "sent a tremor through his work," forcing adaptation. The final cost—permanent entrapment in his own creation—lands with force, though middle pressure could tighten further through more concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear dominant stake: remaining anchored versus reaching for the stars. Escalation follows causal logic from private obsession to public revelation. The conflict between Director Valerius's pragmatism and Kaelen's vision creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible in the choice between safety and expansion, though the personal price Kaelen pays could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear escalation from detecting faint pulses to finding Leo to delivering the message. The stake - Leo's despair versus his grandmother's peace - tightens when Elias recognizes the photograph. Cost is visible in Leo's emotional transformation, though the conflict could have more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal deadline creates urgency, the collapse forces the phase-transition choice, and completing the circuit releases the ghosts - clear escalation under causal lens. However, the resolution feels somewhat mechanical; the ghosts' release lacks struggle or meaningful resistance that would deepen the cost beyond "peaceful" acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build through the hours of failed patterns before the breakthrough, with Elara's pulse counting creating tension. The revelation about darkness between stars meaningfully reweights her own existence, though the physical struggle could intensify more.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake - saving the Old Tongue from being "spoken all at once by a million phantom voices" - creates steady pressure. Escalation builds through the discovery of the starlings' pattern as living syntax. The moment of alignment carries risk ("hands trembled") though the success feels slightly inevitable once the pattern is recognized.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to Clara—escalates through discovery of the grotto, witnessing the transformation, and Julian's final choice to protect rather than expose. The man's metamorphosis provides the key tightening that forces Julian to reconsider his entire mission. Cost is visible in Julian abandoning his organization's goals and accepting permanent separation from the Clara he knew.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal desire to direct confrontation with the Wardens, with clear cost when vines reclaim the statues. The protagonist's agency drives the transformation through her chosen method, though the Wardens' response could show more adaptive pressure before their absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal mission to execution under surveillance threat. The thirty-second window creates genuine pressure with "an eternity in the brittle hush." The cost manifests in the risk taken and the "enforced separation" being challenged. One meaningful tightening through the time constraint effectively narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds effectively through the fragment's discovery, the days of preparation, and the crescendo of bells leading to song. The dominant stake—transforming silence into possibility—deepens through each beat. The cost of breaking a decade of silence is palpable. Minor deduction because the middle section's pacing could tighten between discovery and placement.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding where stories live) intensifies through the ritual's progression from arrangement to manifestation to dissolution. The tension between Elias's grand quest and the mundane library shift creates effective pressure, with clear cost when the vision vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) drives consistent pressure through accumulation. The fog-diffused morning provides the key escalation that enables closure. Cost is visible in "years" of failed attempts and the "aching void" that gets filled, though the middle lacks a distinct tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (freeing the trapped music) is signaled early and escalates through the ritual's progression from waiting to humming to dissolution. The "guardian of the secret" (fear) provides coherent opposition that must be confused rather than confronted directly. Cost is visible in the physical dissolution of the son's remnant, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from passive observation to active intervention as the "violent fracture of light" breaks Elias's thirty-year pattern of non-interference. The tension between his academic caution and desperate need for memory creates genuine pressure. The cost lands clearly—decades of work yield only a fragment, reframing his quest as "finally beginning" rather than concluding.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from learning the knot lesson through the tea-reading revelation about forgetting her mother's face to Elara's final choice. The cost of staying versus attempting return is legible, though the middle lacks a sharper pressure point that would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) is signaled early and pressure coheres through the ritual's escalating stages. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance or complication - Elian succeeds without meaningful obstacle or reversal. The tightening comes through deepening description rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from sensing spirits to working a specific knot to releasing the sailor's rage. The "wave of profound cold" marks clear intensification. Stakes remain focused on one knot/spirit, appropriate for this length, with thousands more establishing ongoing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional curiosity through the tear's mystery to the revelation of deliberate concealment, with each discovery narrowing options—the lichen disruption forces recognition of human intervention. The final choice between repair and acknowledgment carries professional and ethical weight, though the external pressure remains primarily intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: transmission source → strongbox → snow globe → father's note → conceptual understanding. Each revelation deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for the textural lens. The cost becomes legible in the father's infinite energy expenditure and the narrator's decision to leave the monument undisturbed.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (connection with Lyra's consciousness) faces genuine pressure through the time constraint and uncertainty of response. The "heart-stopping second" of potential failure provides the necessary tightening, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once achieved. Cost is visible in the temporary nature of communion and Lyra's entropic decay.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from duty-bound curiosity through encrypted barrier to the revelation of hidden motherhood, with Kael's agency driving each discovery. The cost lands in his commitment to guard this secret "just as she had." Escalation could be stronger if the discovery created more immediate pressure on Kael's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—drives the methodical cloud categorization toward the climactic discovery. Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: from "Tendrils of First Hesitation" through "The Great Sadness" to the explosive noctilucent cloud. The cost manifests in Elias's transformation from seeking to accepting, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment typical of higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: silence → machinery cessation → coin reading → lock opening → building groans → final transformation. The "limit of her time closing in" creates genuine urgency. Cost is visible in the imminent destruction framing the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping the stranded luminance as "his life's work"—is signaled early. Escalation builds through accumulation: frustration → pattern recognition in hopscotch → applying patterns to starlings → discovering the luminance. The cost of his isolation is palpable: "filled with the ghosts of forgotten conversations." One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the board maps time sequences, not space.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from general repair obsession through the mirror's psychological pressure ("silent screams trapped") to the decisive moment of uncapping the irreplaceable eclipse essence. The "last true eclipse" creates genuine scarcity and cost. The blinding light that "refracts possibilities into an unbearable, overlapping cascade of failure" effectively raises pressure through environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reaching the nebula of respite) is clear from opening with meaningful escalation through discovered resources leading to the synchronized climb. The collective effort required for the final ascent forces visible trade-offs and physical risk. Agency manifests through following cryptic instructions despite doubt, culminating in Anya's desperate strike of the bell—a choice with immediate, irreversible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (granting peace before dissolution) established early and deepens through the translation sequence where Elias expends his essence. The cost is legible as he "slumped against the crystal, his breath coming in ragged, satisfied sighs." Agency manifests through deliberate action rather than external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through frost's approach creating a tightening deadline, with the beacon assembly under time pressure and the birds' increasing aggression. The cost lands in the spent nut and Elias's weary return to his cursed duty. Minor deduction because the traveler's escape happens too easily once the beacon activates—no final complication tests the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding what he broke with Lena) deepens through the foam observation that forces Aris to confront his rigid worldview. The escalation from seeing "chaotic froth" to recognizing "beautiful chains" narrows his options to either maintaining rigidity or accepting fluidity. Cost is visible in the loosening grief and the acceptance of separation as valid.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories begin—intensifies through Elian's systematic measurement of absence, building toward his discovery of the virgin tree. The deepening occurs when he realizes creation requires wounding perfection, a meaningful cost. While agency is clear, the emotional price of this violation could be more palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from analyzing puddles to discovering the pavilion to voluntary subsumption of millennia of grief. The pressure coheres through accumulation: personal grief → Warlord's specific loss → collective sorrow requiring total surrender. Cost is unmistakable in the scouring agony that transforms Kaelen.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the linguistic layering method, with the critical moment of the weight trembling marking genuine risk. The transformation from "screeching dissonant roar" to "polyphonic chorus" shows clear pressure resolution with earned cost (his exhaustion, temporary nature of fix).

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds effectively from preparation through neural modification to integration, with the "tide of sorrow and failure threatening to pull her under" creating genuine jeopardy. The dominant stake - preserving human dreams from erasure - faces concrete test through physical and mental cost. Agency drives the entire sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    The gravity inversion creates genuine time pressure and physical stakes that escalate naturally. The cost is visible in Kael's scrambling escape and the "deadly rain" of stones. Stakes tighten effectively from contemplation to action to urgent escape.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: single note (C) → perfect fifth (G) → shifting chord → full breathing symphony, with each addition narrowing Elara's path toward releasing rather than imposing sound. The cost manifests in "filling the hollow space the silence had carved" - her deafness transformed into conducting ability. One meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of imposed melody.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Kaelan decodes increasingly complex silence patterns, moving from simple chess piece analogies to recognizing the full symphonic structure. The "next phase" deadline creates temporal pressure. Cost is clear in his exile and isolation, though the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off moment.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing his grandmother's specific silence before the fireworks begin—creates time pressure that escalates through failed frequency attempts. Each wrong frequency ("sharp, metallic anger," "mournful blue") narrows options until Elias's memory-driven insight provides the solution. The cost is legible when he chooses not to read the diary, preserving the silence at the price of never knowing its contents.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through sensory accumulation—from detecting the seed's "nutty aroma" to the overwhelming "riot of smells" that threatens her peace. The tightening occurs when the new winds force her to choose between fleeing or finding her "still point within." Cost is visible in the physical pain and risk to her careful cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The time-limited Inversion creates genuine pressure—"only minutes" as gravity returns. Stakes escalate from navigating dangerous arches to discovering the crystal's power through the seed pod demonstration. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; Elara obtains the shard without meaningful opposition or sacrifice beyond the inherent danger of navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of the catastrophe—escalates through the patch discovery that forces Kaelen to "pivot from the ground to the sky," fundamentally narrowing his investigative options. The cost manifests in his final realization that perfect foresight arrives only in aftermath, though the middle section could show more resistance before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (certifying wonder as essential) develops through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. While pressure builds through sensory intensification, the lack of opposition or complication limits dramatic tension - Kael faces no meaningful obstacles to completing his task.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding his failure) progresses through concrete steps: arrangement, uncasing, playing differently, receiving insight. The pressure builds appropriately under the accumulative lens through density increase. Cost is visible in the "crushing insight" and sustained grief. However, lacks a strong tightening that forecloses options - the insight arrives without significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: borrowing personality → focusing halo fragment → pulling lever → experiencing grief as equation. The transformation imposes clear cost (Anya's disorientation), though the conflict lacks a meaningful resistance point or complication that would deepen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation operates through textural density: the pendant's dormancy breaking into vibration, time warping to reveal phantom travelers, then Elara's memory appearing, culminating in the impossible garden. The cost is legible in Kael's transformation from routine courier to myth-keeper, his old self explicitly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking communion to confronting mechanical truth. The dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) is tested and transformed when proven true but emotionally devastating. Cost is legible in Elias's physical collapse and worldview shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative loss—each thread woven costs specific memories, building to the final sacrifice of the amber bead and complete severance. The moment of faltering when his name vanishes creates meaningful pressure. Cost is unmistakable: she trades her entire emotional history for the message's delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from understanding the silk's purpose to descending the shaft to the actual barter of memories, each step narrows options. The cost is unmistakable: trading lived experience for planetary healing. Minor deduction as the magician's initial harm could be more directly connected to Elian's solution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal quest to preventing dimensional catastrophe. The pressure tightens when Kael realizes the cascade is about to repeat, forcing immediate action. Cost is legible: accepting he cannot save Elara, only redirect consequences. One meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from routine supply run to desperate rescue when the light fails, with the storm amplifying physical danger. Silas's agency drives every beat from choosing to cross dangerous seas to fixing the mechanism. Cost is visible in the keeper's absence and Silas's acceptance of the watch.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the storm's approach, Kaelan's increasingly manic manipulation, and the lighthouse shuddering "from resonance" as pressure peaks. The dominant stake—shaping reality through storm manipulation—tightens as unintended prophetic consequences emerge. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and the realization of reciprocal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some people magnetize stories—deepens through Kaelen's methodical light-tracking experiments, with escalation occurring through accumulation rather than reversal. The woman's gravitational effect on light creates tangible pressure, though the resolution relies somewhat on her external revelation rather than Kaelen's earned discovery, slightly weakening agency at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from routine work to the mysterious *tink*, to analyzing the tree's centuries of life, to the spike in sorrow-meter readings. The storm's crescendo aligning with moonlight creates meaningful deepening that enables transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes intensify through the accumulation of song fragments, each requiring careful tending that deepens Elara's connection to the dying ecosystem. The pressure peaks when she must wrap the nascent sun in sound itself, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth after such buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to understand his fear-driven refusal—escalates through Elara's arrival, forcing him to test his new technique and discover that connection doesn't require "braving the storm." The cost is visible in his renunciation of complete solitude and acknowledgment of shared purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—from private hoarding (bread) to public action (planting) to witnessed defiance (confrontation)—with cost visible in Elara's "stiff joints" and isolation. The patrolman's arrival raises stakes appropriately, though his quick transformation from threat to understanding slightly softens the pressure at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning before complete erasure—intensifies through the vow's "failing heartbeat" and Kaelen's desperate precision work. The escalation from steady work to frantic capture ("His fingers flew across the controls") creates genuine pressure. However, the conflict lacks a true reversal or complication; the capture succeeds on first attempt, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through three failed attempts (chaos, appeal to law, direct bribe) before the decisive lie. Each failure narrows options and raises urgency against sunrise deadline. The cost is legible in the destroyed trust and Silas's humiliation, though the personal cost to Elara could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from individual investigation to witnessing collective phenomenon, with pressure building through sensory cacophony and weather system merger. The convergence creates genuine tension about what will happen when storms combine. Cost is visible in Elara's transformed understanding, though the personal risk to her beyond intellectual humbling could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Central conflict between commercial success and artistic authenticity escalates through the lock-picking sequence where each color represents a step toward creative freedom. The cost is legible in years of "bankrupt" artistry and the "scraped raw" feeling from patrons' laughter. Could strengthen with more immediate pressure during the unlocking.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal dissatisfaction through map discovery to the vault revelation, with clear deepening when Elian understands the seeds' purpose. The cost of abandoning his traditional role for cultivation is legible. One meaningful tightening through discovery suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes accumulate through the sculpture's construction toward the singular moment of wind activation. The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a grey world—faces its test when the sculpture must destroy itself to release its truth. Cost is legible: "the music literally costing the ice its form" shows beauty traded for meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the android's increasing power draw: life support diversion → geothermal surge → structural breach, each raising stakes as "emergency lights paint the scene in strokes of blood-red." The chaos actively resists "with the full weight of a child's terror," forcing the android to risk fragmentation. Cost is legible in the destroyed dome and abandoned purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from threatened drill to community preservation through accumulated storytelling pressure. Each neighbor's fragment tightens the solution path toward the locket-as-key revelation, with visible cost in the community garden funding that honors Mrs. Gable's memory.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: failed conventional attacks → dance as translation → recognition that control must yield to chance. The stakes deepen when Elara realizes she must encrypt her own vulnerability as the key. Cost is visible in surrendering the control her mother couldn't release.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering Elara's deleted memories—intensifies through the ritual sequence as Silas moves from observation (coffee grounds) to action (reaching into the gravitational pocket). The cost is legible: he risks everything for a fragment, and the fleeting nature of the recovered memory ("Then it was gone") shows the price of his method. The whale's influence creating temporary access adds urgency without feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear - the prophecy threatens societal order through "insidious rustle of contagion." The conflict escalates through the mapping and channeling sequence, with tension in whether Elara can complete the silencing. Cost is present but somewhat abstract in the "fragile" nature of the solution rather than personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from borrowing sugar through weekly lessons to Clara's need for truth, with the seal amplifying building whispers as the pressure mechanism. The rooftop confrontation crystallizes the choice between comfortable illusion and difficult truth. Cost is visible in Clara accepting her role, though the middle section could tighten pressure more distinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear escalation from initial contact with the spire through memory fragments to full revelation, with Elian's choice to "push harder" marking the decisive turn. The dominant stake (reclaiming identity vs. safe isolation) tightens effectively as dawn approaches. The cost manifests in experiencing the traumatic memory fully - "the ghost of her hand slipping from his."

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear - breaking an unwinnable seven-century war through "calibrated treason." The tension builds through the precision required ("steadiness of his hand") with kingdom-level consequences. The tightening occurs when thorn touches parchment. Missing a stronger sense of immediate opposition or complication during the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through progressive disclosure from initial question ("why some echo") through personal grief (mother's silence) to cosmic understanding. The dominant stake - understanding echoes as "resonances of cosmic debt" - tightens when Lyra must actively complete songs rather than just listen. Cost is visible in accepting this burden. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding shifts from intellectual to embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from detecting the boy's appearances to exposing the man's obstruction to achieving the boy's release. Elara's agency drives the progression through creating the shared dreamscape. The confrontation carries weight but resolution comes somewhat easily once truth is revealed—more resistance from the man would strengthen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from distant observation to descent into the firefly field to the whistling attempt. The "demure audacity" stirring within drives his choice to participate rather than observe, with clear emotional cost when the moment breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds from surface observation to document reconstruction to the final alignment test, each step narrowing the truth. The dominant stake—exposing truth versus preserving protective myth—tightens when Kaelen must intuit the final step, though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly from isolated prophet to fulcrum of nascent world. The Great Storm forces choice between "absolute order" and "total anarchy," with Elian's agency creating the third path. Pressure coheres through mounting follower expectations and warring shadow demands. Cost is legible in abandoning supernatural allegiance. Minor deduction for somewhat abstract articulation of the shadow-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from discovering the silent music box to the poet's deliberate choice to create rather than restore, with pressure building through the "heavier than any sound" silence that demands response. The accumulation of captured sounds represents agency through attention and curation, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external complication testing the poet's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from initial detection through intensifying threat ("entire tower shuddered") to the climactic frequency battle. The protagonist's agency drives resolution through specific technical choices. Cost is visible in the "excruciating process" and molecular-level transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from patient observation through the moon's alignment to the single decisive action. The "harmonic key turning a cosmic lock" represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, though the resolution lacks immediate personal cost beyond the release of long-held tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's professional autonomy versus Fletcher's control—escalates through the entangled memory experience that forces him beyond empirical limits. The cost is clear: defying Fletcher risks professional consequences. However, the external pressure remains static (Fletcher's initial directive), and the conflict resolution feels somewhat predetermined once the journal appears.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding how to reach the unreachable—tightens through the clockwork heart revelation from "replacement for a soul" to "lockbox." The cost (Thorne's suicide, Arthur's failure) is clear, though the conflict could push harder against Arthur's initial certainties.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to life-risking test flight, with the acid sea as lethal consequence. The "Grip" discovery creates a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Agency drives the climax—Kaelen chooses to test his theory despite mortal danger. The cost is legible (potential death) though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: personal search → pattern discovery → security breach → supervisor confrontation → whistleblowing decision. Kael's appearance forces immediate tactical shift (lying) with palpable tension. Cost becomes visible when Elara chooses truth over safety, though the specific professional consequences could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows causal progression from accusation to investigation to revelation, with stakes tightening as visions reveal deeper truths. The dominant stake of community cohesion faces real threat with visible cost in Mara's past loss. Agency operates through Kael's choice to seek deeper truth rather than declare verdict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the sound of approaching endings"—tightens when the fold in patience appears, creating tension between waiting for comprehension versus waiting for death. The ice-calving provides meaningful deepening that resolves her search. Cost is visible in her acknowledged selfishness and the volunteers giving her "wide berth."

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding past heartbreak—deepens through the vineyard parallel, forcing Elias to reconfigure his memory from "spiteful act" to "act of preservation." Cost is visible in accepting they were "planted in the wrong garden." One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds from verbal distortion to physical journey to psychic consecration, with the "staggering mental weight" providing clear cost at closure. The stakes deepen as Kael moves from witnessing corruption to actively preserving truth through the ancient machine. One meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into healing—develops through accumulation rather than dramatic escalation, appropriate for the textural lens. Each photograph adds weight: "weeping by a silent conveyor belt," "walking away from the factory gates for the last time." The final photograph of the girl releasing the paper boat provides meaningful deepening that reweights all prior images, though the lack of immediate pressure or resistance keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsolescence to choosing between documentation and testimony. The pressure builds through acoustic accumulation, forcing Elias's final renunciation. Cost is visible in abandoning publication, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through the deepening fog path, forgotten memories, and rising hum that becomes "palpable thrum," forcing Silas from desperate pursuit to acceptance. The cost is legible in his kneeling surrender and the "profound echo still ringing in his soul," though the stakes could tighten more sharply in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from vibrations to structural threat to the moment of lens insertion with "violent crescendo" and cracking portal window. The trade-off is explicit: sacrifice the lens (and memory) to save the station. Agency drives the resolution through Elias's trained perception and decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of achieving the "flawless goodbye" drives escalation through Elara's investigation, difficult call, and orchestration. The resistance from Lena creates genuine pressure that tightens when she arrives. Cost is visible in the tear and death. Slightly mechanical resolution once Lena arrives reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from abstract question to concrete discovery as Elara progresses from studying the key to achieving the "sealed awakening." The dominant stake—understanding shadow behavior in warped reality—tightens through the methodical closing of logical loops. Cost appears in weeks of painstaking work and the foreclosed simplicity of pre-spoon reality, though immediate pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to reconcile his rationalism with evidence of the supernatural—escalates through the physical discovery that forces "a compound fracture of the soul." The tooth's impossibility creates irreversible pressure that forecloses his skeptical worldview. Cost is visible in accepting he dismissed his wife's truth, though the conflict could benefit from more active resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (creating light without fire) established early and deepens through patient accumulation. The glass's transformation from opaque to "reflectively vibrant" to self-luminescent represents meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost manifests in time ("hours bled"), physical effort (repetitive polishing), and emotional weight of fire memory. Minor deduction: the final transformation relies partially on coincidental twilight rather than pure protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: Elara's patient tending, the emerging ice pattern, then her decisive choice to offer the pendant with its reframed meaning. The cost is legible in Kaelen's response and the "fertile ground" that replaces his isolation. The single meaningful deepening (pattern recognition to action) fits the 600-word scope well.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each ghostly encounter intensifies Elias's recognition of creative betrayal, culminating in the "gale threatening to sweep him into nothingness." The burial choice forecloses his role as author in favor of keeper, with clear cost in accepting his failures. The physical current's transformation from opposition to "gentle nudge" marks earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the song's progression: initial trembling to confident surge, simple hum to full chant, single vine glow to entire canopy transformation. The pressure coheres around restoring practices with the fleeting lunar alignment as deadline. Cost is visible in the "lifetime" of teaching work ahead, though the village's specific need could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving a lost child through alchemical cartography—escalates through the accumulation of ritual steps (listening→gathering→arranging→pouring starlight→sealing) with visible physical cost. The pressure deepens when Kaelen pours his "own stillness into the design," though the absence of competing options or failure risk slightly limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation—from studying reflections to understanding the timer's logic to reconstruction. The dominant stake (preserving wonder) faces genuine pressure from the "wounded season's oppressive calm" and the broken mechanism. Cost is visible in weeks of patient observation and the weight of dormant memories waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming burdens into peaceful silence—escalates through the ritual's precise steps: drawing the wisp, aligning with starlight, crystallizing the grief. The farmer's "feather-light touch of gratitude" shows immediate consequence. Cost is visible in both the transformed pain and Kaelen's ongoing imprisonment. The accumulative pressure deepens as each stone makes the silence "infinitesimally heavier."

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the kettle's rising simmer to shriek, paralleling Elara's journey from containment to release, with the dominant stake being whether she can transform loss into usable wisdom. The memory of Leo's stillness with the cub deepens understanding and enables her decisive carving action, with cost visible in the "newly scarred block" that represents both damage and creation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from collecting echoes to confronting specific memory to accepting fault, with the camera wheel discovery tightening options from general negotiation to specific reckoning. The ghost's "It wasn't our fault" creates genuine opposition. Cost is visible in "monument to his own eroded ambitions" though the middle could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through discovery (sextant piece) → investigation (hidden grid) → active problem-solving (rewiring) → revelation (star chart), with each phase narrowing Elara's focus. The cost manifests as her three-hour solitary labor and the poignant contrast between the terminal's magnificent purpose and its demolition fate, though the stakes could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of making peace with abandoned dreams escalates through the physical burden of carrying the coffer, the ritual placement, and the sunrise transformation. Cost is visible in twenty years of silence and the final acceptance. However, no active opposition or complication deepens the pressure beyond the protagonist's internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to family vindication as the grappling hook's "dead, unyielding weight" signals discovery. The radio's static creates a functional deadline that pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on preserving ancient maritime knowledge before it vanishes.

The three-day investment creates temporal pressure, though more visceral cost could strengthen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from understanding a single absence to experiencing the full weight of Elara's grief-mapping project. The projection's intensification from seeing to feeling ("phantom ache in her shoulders") raises cost, though agency remains primarily observational until Kaelen's final act of writing transforms understanding into testament.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes intensify from assembling fragments to the creature's emergence, with Kaelen growing "thinner, more bedraggled" as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—rewriting an inherited legacy of destruction—escalates from contemplation at the lagoon through active firefighting to the intimate grafting scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from following architectural breadcrumbs to the final alignment requiring "sidereal patience." The stakes crystallize when starlight hits the box and Elara must rotate it precisely—one wrong move wastes years of calculation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring communal balance through ritual remembrance—is signaled early and deepens through the imagined release sequence. Escalation occurs through the intensification of memory and the difficulty of "letting go." However, the conflict remains largely internal without external complication, limiting the pressure's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative detail: from general obsession to specific decoding method to the final silver thread that "snapped into focus."

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from survival to cultural revival through the accumulation of modeling details and the weight of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving forbidden stories—is clear, with escalation through the risk Elias takes and the "clenching fear" he endures. The tension between state-sanctioned work and secret preservation creates genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can find peace through Elara's ritual—escalates through accumulating symbolic weight: portrait becomes ash, ash awaits perfect stillness, stillness enables release. The tightening occurs as Kael moves from fragile hope ("You are the one who can… preserve her?") through mesmerized participation to final commitment with "knuckles white." Cost is visible in the temporary nature of the peace achieved: "for now, in the quiet of the stilled chair, he had this one beautiful, fleeting illusion."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - preserving truth versus accepting erasure - intensifies through the girl's appearance, forcing Silas to confront his mission's futility.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from observing deadness to actively placing the orris root at the source house, with "heart hammered a frantic, muffled rhythm."

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through cascading revelations that progressively narrow Mara's options: sanctuary not tomb → poison not purifier → lung not weakness.

However, the absence of immediate external pressure or time constraint slightly dampens urgency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from mapping impossible physics to risking self-unraveling ("prodding a sleeping god"), with the seven-roll creating genuine rupture that delivers the sought texture at agonizing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—transcending causality—escalates through the assembly of the final component, with cost signaled in "either liberate him or erase him from existence entirely." The tension builds through textural accumulation: from the settling foundations to the tide's nadir to the lever pull. The "bleak exhilaration" and "tremor in his soul" embody the risk. Minor deduction as the conflict is primarily internal without external opposition, though this suits the piece's meditative nature.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fear's attempt to "capture me in my brokenness" creates genuine stakes that escalate from finding the clasp to the mirror confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through pattern discovery: from seeking communication to understanding the warning to facing extinction.

The escalation under accumulative lens works through density increase rather than reversal, though the physical stakes could heighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from sensing dissonance to finding the stamp to confirming the match to understanding theft.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (processing grief through the dream-gem) escalates through physical ascent paired with emotional descent, with gem-polishing as active resistance against being consumed.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moon-phase protocol creates escalating pressure through its rigid stages, with the exchange moment crystallizing as "that space between apology and forgiveness."

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake of reconciling with the sea after navigation failure is clear, with one meaningful deepening as Elias moves from avoidance to facing water.

    Under the Hybrid lens, pressure coheres and escalates through the countdown of the cooling breakers, forcing a tactical race against time. The dominant stake (finding the reservoir) is narrowed by this live clock, and the cost of her pursuit is legible in the final, charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are signaled early ("missing pieces") and escalate through a single, meaningful tightening: the drone's physical struggle to pull the handle. This action narrows options and imposes a clear cost of strain and effort, driving the protagonist toward the climax under the causal lens. The pressure is coherent and the resolution is earned entirely through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to a cosmic horror of erased existence, driven by Elias's agency in discovering the driftwood. The cost is unmistakable: the "terrifying, structured absence" forces a trade-off, narrowing his options to one path. The tightening is causal and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, adhering to the rigid protocol. The stake—exchanging lives to recycle past mistakes—tightens meaningfully with the unlocking of the box. The cost is legible in the "weary distrust" and the final, solitary image of Elias holding the warm brass.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under the causal lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the choice to follow coordinates, to descend, to read the letter. Each step narrows options and raises emotional stakes. The cost is legible in the final spark—a felt price for the journey that reweights his entire purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, building through the ritual's progression. The cost—the irreversible loss of his human form—is legible on the page. A minor deduction for a slight softening of pressure mid-ritual; the resistance tremor is potent but could be more deeply leveraged to narrow options further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation reads as a decisive cadence shift and density increase—the realization that reweights the dominant stake. The protagonist's agency (the choice to unfasten the cloak, trace her hand) drives the escalation under pressure. The cost of relinquishing her search is felt on the page, charging the final image of promise.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalate through each photograph's emotional weight, culminating in the protagonist's own profound pain. Agency is demonstrated through her method of acceptance, and the cost is legible in the physical pressure she endures and the ship's sympathetic reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift driven by Kael's agency in releasing the fireflies. The dominant stake (understanding transformation) is reweighted with a visible, felt cost—the mountain's sigh of release and its new heartbeat. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully through the protagonist's actions, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (control of the fort) is signaled early and tightens through his precise, risky action at the sundial. The cost is the palpable tension of discovery, legible in his "white knuckles" and held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (protecting the nexus) is signaled early and escalates through the vision of the climbing tide. The pressure coheres under the hybrid lens, forcing Kael's stance crystallization to use the forbidden star dust. The cost is visible in the diverted wave and his exhaustion. A minor deduction as the escalation from vision to action feels slightly rapid, though the high stakes justify the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by the timer's mechanical heartbeat, a coherent pressure that crystallizes Elias's stance. The dominant stake (understanding scars) tightens through the hour, foreclosing passive reflection and forcing active confrontation. The cost is legible in the "absolute" silence after the ping and his "finally, honestly trembling" hands, which alter tactics from waiting to acting.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes are signaled early (decoding the challenge) and escalate through Kaelen's agency under the causal lens. Each fencing move is a tactical choice that narrows options based on the needle card's code. The cost is the intense focus and physical precision required, legible in the final, successful strike.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift: the arrival of the two figures at the entrance. This deepens the dominant stake (rebuilding) from a private act to a communal one, introducing the risk and potential of trust. The cost is the vulnerability of their hidden operation, made legible by Elara's "calming hand" and the newcomers' tentative approach.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (collapse of pathways) escalates under hybrid lens via time pressure and the tactical use of the film reel. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, culminating in a costly choice. The felt price of abandoning his post is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (cultural memory loss) is signaled early and escalates through the monsoon's approach, forcing a leap of faith. The tightening is driven by time pressure and dream interpretation, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost is legible in the panic before the breakthrough and the rain's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)

== Grader: GPT-5 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether he will stay in filtered observation or engage with messy decay; the middle deepening (seeing resource transfer from orchid to weed) narrows options by reframing loss. The final action pays a visible price (relinquishing the protective filter) and aligns internal and external stakes. Quiet but decisive escalation fits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal (trauma vs. purpose) with an external pressure (smugglers’ menace) shadowing choices. Escalation tightens via the dawn routine and discovery of the cave; refusing to enter and then firing the kiln registers as a trade-off with risk. Quiet but firm pressure under the chosen lens; no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (restoring joy/creating music from silence) is signaled early and tightened when the capsize flashback nearly overwhelms the flower’s “song.” The key deepening is her choice to weave terror into beauty, not erase it, narrowing options and exacting effort. The price (physical depletion; emotional exposure) reads in the aftermath. Tension escalates coherently without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ending psychic cacophony—tightens through one decisive deepening: traversing the “impossible space” to install the heart. The pressure sequence and inert astrolabe focus tension effectively. The fit‑perfectly key moment borders on convenience, and the ongoing price is lightly sketched. Still, agency drives the turn and the cost is felt in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (from consumption to cultivation) is signaled and tightened by the bell’s revelation and Elara’s decision to declare rather than ambush. The reversal from secrecy to public vow narrows options and invites risk. Consequence arrives next dawn with communal buy-in and donor’s shifted offering. On‑page cost is tasteful but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and coherent (can she transform the ache by finding where love goes), and escalation occurs through the inhale/exhale cadence culminating in the motes. The tightening is modest but clear: clarity fails to yield the answer; surrender to mystery does. The cost is primarily internal—relinquishing a storage‑place fantasy—rather than externally constraining. Still, the on‑page method-driven deepening earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (save his memories/self) is clear from the outset. Escalation tightens through the “impossible center” and the decision to focus the maze’s angles to sever the shard’s hold. The price is unmistakable—complete erasure—reweighting the premise. Slightly limited by a single, clean turn rather than layered reversals, but fully sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (impede enforcers long enough to save the vault) is signaled early and escalates with the wall’s collapse and the onrushing enforcers. The decisive tightening comes from her decoding and triggering a multi‑layered, nonlethal gauntlet that forecloses direct confrontation and trades freedom for time. The cost is plain: she chooses endurance over escape, accepting likely capture. Tension scales at sentence and beat levels without artificial reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: capture and contain betrayal’s sound before it hardens in him. Escalation tightens as jars are opened, the aurora intensifies, and the forge compresses absences, culminating in the painful sonic break. The price is paid in enduring that sound and in the years of curation, and the final choice (wearing the crystal, accepting silence as boundary) forecloses further pursuit. Pressure remains coherent and grows under the ritual’s demands.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure deepens rather than reverses: the bizarre bouquet forces reinterpretation, shifting the job from theft to pilgrimage. The meaningful tightening is the decision to pursue an unknown, higher-stakes object and then to take it, forfeiting his prior anchoring. Cost is conceptual but legible in the identity loss. Limited external antagonism keeps tension mostly internal, but it sustains under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (finish the lens vs. survive) is signaled early and tightens under the warning and tilt. The meaningful turn is Elara’s renunciation of the piece, which forecloses a path and exacts a visible price. Internal and external pressures intertwine (artistic purpose vs. structural failure). Slightly linear escalation, but clean and sufficiently charged for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (survival/agency vs. erasure), and escalation tightens with Julian’s arrival and the choice not to flee but to trigger containment. The refusal to engage in a fight scene forecloses an option and redefines the conflict on the protagonist’s terms. Cost is primarily internal (risk, exposure), felt in the tremor at the end. Stakes remain coherent and rise under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular and clear: complete tonight’s retelling before the star disappears. Escalation reads via density—hush deepens, the star flickers twice then dissolves—narrowing options to now or never. The price is primarily endurance and restraint (refusing to look at the star or heed the storm), not a sharper trade‑off, keeping pressure elegant but gentle. One solid tightening lands, but no hard reversal or loss alters tactics mid‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the prison/origin of thought—is clear early; pressure tightens when the strategy shifts from physical to conceptual interfacing. The warnings and accumulated loop debt give the choice felt cost. Escalation is primarily internal, but the decisive act credibly forecloses prior approaches. Slightly low friction: success meets little resistance once the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—bridging mistrust—tightens through a decisive choice (to eavesdrop) that risks job and moral standing. The discovery at the cenotaph reweights opposition (accusation vs. confession) and forces a new tactic (silent admission via lens/box). Cost is legible and ongoing; mistrust does not vanish, preserving consequence. Tension is internal but sustained and escalates cleanly under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: setup of the contest → precise, sterile success of automata → apparent loss (tablet’s edge to machines) → reversal via butterflies. Agency is steady endurance rather than a sharp late decision, but the marble crack is a paid, personal cost that seals stance. Pressure remains coherent, with one meaningful beat of tightening (the near‑dismissal) before the turn. Luck does not resolve the problem; Elias’s cultivated ecology does.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Aris’s proof—remains coherent, and the lever provides the one meaningful tightening. Pressure derives from a rare timing window and the risk of null results, but the cost remains largely reputational/psychic, not contested on the page. The outcome, while resonant, arrives without a counterforce beyond time’s hush. Strong for a quiet piece but limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake—decoding the ghost’s message—tightens into a single high‑leverage decision: risk the artifact to break the stasis. The cost is tangible and thematically apt, and the pressure coheres under the chosen lens. Tension operates quietly but escalates via the stillness/disruption contrast. A touch more resistance or risk signal in the beat-up to submerge the program could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes center on whether to fix Liam’s legacy or live with paradox; pressure tightens as “found” versus “failed” becomes mutually exclusive. The decisive deepening is the recognition that she needed the smudge’s ambiguity, which narrows options to a costed refusal. No antagonist is needed; internal/external pressures (cold, instruments, memory) braid coherently. The price—living inside unresolved possibility—is legible and carried into the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens when the unseen “shift” focuses blame on him, narrowing choices to intervention. The external stakes (haunting machinery crisis) and internal stakes (paralyzed guilt) interlock at the valve. The price—physical strain and acceptance of ongoing burden—is legible and scaled to the length. Escalation is clean and protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are unified (mental integrity vs duty) and escalate via a density break: Aeridor’s noise compels the burrow. The tightening forecloses continuing to endure in place and forces the trade‑off of temporary abdication. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of return. It’s a quiet arc, but the pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear early (reframing grief), and pressure coheres as the light diminishes and Lena opens the box. The decisive tightening is the timed “linking” during totality, which tests endurance and attention rather than force. Cost is felt via embodied grief rather than argued. A slightly guided feel reduces the sense of risk at the peak but doesn’t undercut escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates via density and revelation rather than reversal: “The wobble is worse” to “The dragons are dying” tightens the conceptual stakes. The decisive internal move is a renunciation of saviorhood, with the cost of ache and futility. Stakes remain largely internal, but the cadence shift at the burned confession and final union of objects is a real deepening. The piece avoids empty intensifiers; each discovery raises the existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (orchestrating a covert handoff) is clear and resolved; internal stake (control vs. release) culminates in leaving. However, the exchange unfolds without real obstruction or reversal, so tension plateaus rather than tightens. The personal cost is meaningful, but the operational risk stays largely notional. One concrete snag would have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are signaled early (save Elara before completion), and pressure tightens via pattern intensification and a decisive cadence break. The agency is Alistair’s throughout; each choice complicates or narrows options, culminating in the vacuum switch. The cost is primarily conceptual with modest embodied impact; still, the narrowing reads. A single, clean escalation suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (achieve resonant alignment before energy fails) tightens effectively with the approaching dawn and the “one missing bridge.” The visible cost is his last reserve spent and a renunciation of domination for attunement. Escalation is internal but coherent; the lavender line and vibrating light sharpen the pinch. While external opposition is minimal, the clock and exhaustion provide credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (escape the loop by facing the origin memory) is set early; escalation occurs as he shifts from treating the tablet as map to codex and chooses acceptance rather than avoidance. The pressure is internal but coherent, and the “seed” mechanism narrows options to one painful act. Cost is felt but quiet, not harrowing; still, it forecloses the prior coping strategy. No antagonist is needed; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (defeating numbness) is clear and tightens as the inverted song swells and elicits embodied responses. Escalation is a deepening of density and shared resonance rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is an acceptance of silence’s terms and a refusal of old sound, felt in the final earned stasis. Slight softness remains in explicit trade‑off articulation, but the charge is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving integrity/solitude while confronting a coherent threat—tightens through the pigeon’s arrival and the data’s impossible implications. The key escalation is the re-interpretation of the coordinates as a map, narrowing options to a covert route. The on-page cost is mainly a renunciation (no authorities, no confrontation), not a concrete loss. Tension is steady and cohesive, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can he face and metabolize the scent/memory) is clear from the outset. Escalation tightens via the UV inscription reveal and the irreversible bloom, narrowing options to endurance or flight; he chooses endurance with cost. The coincidence of timing is framed as planned (“scheduled to bloom”), keeping pressure coherent. The resolution feels earned by his agency in staying and breathing it in.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and clear: subsume into the whole or remain singular—with Elias forging a third stance by reframing. The pressure coheres and deepens when the Lumin arrives and when Elias decodes the pattern. Escalation is intellectual rather than visceral but still narrows options toward a consequential refusal. The price is signaled (loss of collective omnitemporality versus continued mortal narrowing) though not felt physically.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure deepens via pattern: tentative offering → sensed reply → conversation with remnants; the meaningful tightening is her refusal to “violate” the hush. The visible price (physical fatigue, self‑restraint) scales to length and charges the ending. Stakes remain internal/artistic but coherent. No antagonist is needed under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (produce joy without sorrow) is established early and tightened as he must first endure the full contradictory emotion. The major turn is his acceptance of personal cost to fulfill the client’s request, which forecloses an easier, less ethical path. Tension deepens from approach to contact to separation, with a concrete price at the end. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal but coherent and escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elias initiate and how will Alina receive it—is coherent and carried to completion. Escalation is gentle: the locket reveal tightens and greenlights his risk, but there’s minimal counterpressure or loss. The emotional price (vulnerability, reputational/financial risk) is present but not tested on the page. Tension is steady rather than ratcheting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (belonging) are legible early and tighten with the communal search, which forces Kaelen into a risk of exposure and potential rejection. The key deepening is the reframing of Echo from vandal to collaborator, which compels Kaelen’s costly, proactive offering. Pressure is gentle but coherent under a causal/accumulative mode, culminating in a public test (his mats) and a communal response. A touch more friction or possible refusal on the page might have heightened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (prevent giant waking/shattering city) is clear and pressures choices; the tightening occurs at the primary nest where failure would cascade. Elias’s agency drives the turn (choosing a surgical beat rather than “fighting” the creature), consistent with the Causal lens. The price is mainly conceptual—delicacy under catastrophic risk—without a concrete loss, keeping this shy of higher bands. Tension scales well across beats without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (reconfiguring ambiguous loss) is legible early and tightens when the chosen method either will resonate or fail. The single deepening—projection of the living theorem and its “dovetail”—reweights options and produces a felt price (acceptance without relief of absence). Pressure is internal and textural rather than adversarial, consistent with the lens. Slightly more risk of failure or cost pre‑projection would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (salvaging a singular oral history, restoring hope) are clear and felt. Pressure deepens via the outage’s wipe, the narrow dawn window, and the uncertainty of Anya’s reaction. Escalation is gentle but coherent; the key tightening is his choice to surface and place the tape where detection is possible. The on‑page price remains subtle, limiting peak torque.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (how to respond to collapse) and tightened by the irreparable break and the failed morning repair. The observable turn (from hammer/nails to saw/pry bar) forecloses a live option with emotional cost. Internal and external conflicts braid (identity/retirement versus trellis collapse). Stakes remain personal but weighty, with pressure growing coherently to the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tightening arrives when the woman claims the brooch, forcing a trade‑off between possession and meaning. Stakes remain human‑scale but consequential for Elias’s aim; cost is felt and alters tactics (he relinquishes object, seeks narrative). Escalation is quiet yet coherent under a causal lens. One deepening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens as the cave’s music destabilizes Lyra’s power, culminating at the threshold choice. The cost is not only symbolic; Lyra forfeits her defining ability and remit. External opposition is minimal, making tension primarily internal, but cadence and pressure do escalate under the chosen lens. A slight softness remains in the ease of post‑decision logistics, though the emotional price carries.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on reclaiming a shared narrative/hope; escalation arrives when the object intersects with a survivor, converting abstract purpose into immediate consequence. The tightening is a knowledge deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate for the accumulative mode. The price—confrontation with loss and the burden of custodianship—is felt but understated. A slightly sharper on‑page test of Kaelen’s stance would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reaching and understanding the fortress—tightens from navigation to a dead end to an otherworldly vault to guardianship. The meaningful turn is the recognition that the dare is succession, not mere location. However, pressure is mostly inward and accepting the role meets little on‑page resistance, making the price feel light. Tension is elegant but could use one test or trade‑off beat to sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—completing the grandmother’s project as a true memorial—tightens under the storm and the impulse to discard the tile. The decisive act (transcribing) narrows options and leads to a transformative outcome. The price is internal: risking self-delusion and surrendering a protective skepticism. Escalation is clean if quiet, fitting this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is focused: risk obliteration to break the curse. Pressure coheres and tightens once—when space “refuses” and the amulet floods him with all lived moments, forcing his decisive embrace and reconfiguration. The price is clear, though escalation lacks a substantive reversal beyond the amulet’s pushback. The final crossing is protagonist‑driven and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (Silus’s life and Elara’s moral ledger), and one tightening arrives with the 72-hour forgery window and pre-dawn loading. Pressure remains coherent but glides—no explicit snag or near-miss escalates cost on the page. The price is primarily ethical and procedural, not dramatized through a reversal. Effective, but it leaves intensity on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—successfully isolating the Aquacade texture—tightens at the dawn inflection. The escalation is subtle but real: the hum’s waver is the beat where options narrow and precision matters. Cost remains mostly implied (ongoing solitude and ritual discipline), so pressure never quite bites. Resolution is earned by her agency without reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres through density and cadence: incoming tide → maximal layering → horn rupture → quiet retreat. The dominant stake (touching memory) tightens as the narrator stacks grief over the label and pays the price when it fragments. Agency is primarily attentional and curatorial rather than confrontational, which slightly mutes perceived risk. Still, the turn is unmistakable and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: reproduce and interpret Thorne’s last observation. Escalation arrives when the tone “locks in,” the shell glows, and the dust forms a needle, then collapses to silence. Agency drives the turn, but the price feels largely conceptual rather than materially narrowing options. The tightening is real but gentle for elite‑market tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—surviving privatization on their terms—is signaled early and tested by the inspector’s visit. The meaningful tightening arrives with her early inspection, narrowing options and validating the stealth strategy. The visible price is mainly risk and restraint (renouncing open resistance), not a concrete loss, keeping tension credible but not scalding. Resolution flows from Kael’s agency without coincidence solving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the last bloom before dawn—tightens through the timed chemical lure and the approaching sunrise. The key turn is the ray of light that erases the subject, sharpening the felt price. Escalation is coherent but gentle; external resistance remains environmental rather than adversarial. Still, endurance and timing credibly narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (repair before departure) is clear and escalates via horn blasts and the discovery of a deeper fracture. The meaningful tightening is the hidden micro‑strut damage that forces a combined tactic (patch + reinforcement) under a live clock. Resolution is earned by her method and poise, not coincidence. The price is chiefly time and focus, credible at this length if modest in magnitude.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—witness and record the convergence—stays coherent, with pressure mounting through sensory intensification. Agency is quiet but present: he kills the lamp, commits to the method, and arms himself with the spectrograph. The meaningful tightening is the frost-map’s appearance as herald, forcing a revaluation of his mission. Cost is intellectual/identity, not physical, but it’s legible at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular and legible: re‑animating a town’s pulse. Escalation occurs via density increase—footfalls → ghost steps → market apparitions—culminating in an anchoring act at dawn. Pressure remains gentle; no option is foreclosed beyond time and stamina, so cost reads as devotion rather than sacrifice. Still, the cadence shift at the square is a credible tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (capture vs. survival) is signaled early and tightens when the hush “lunges,” escalating to the oxygen alarm and the near-drop of the vial. The key turn is the refusal to abort by overriding instinct, narrowing options to a single high-cost path. The cost lands: power flatlines and isolation intensifies. Tension sustains at sentence and beat levels without gimmickry.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—claiming truth at personal reputational cost—is established early and tightens with the discovery and then the decision to break the seal. The act forecloses a path (keeping the impossibility intact) and incurs cost (disbelief, destroyed evidence of the miracle). Pressure coheres without needing multiple reversals. A touch more in‑scene resistance or hesitation at the door would heighten escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accrues through density and pattern breaks (longer apparitions, the bud’s approach to bloom), culminating in the transference with Lyra’s explicit release. The dominant stake—receiving/fulfilling a legacy—tightens, but Elian’s agency is mostly acceptance rather than an active trade‑off. Cost (her dissolution; toxic nurture) is legible and charges the ending. A sharper on‑page choice for Elian would raise tension.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear early (salvaging a nascent, communal art) and escalate with the dust storm into a single urgent choice. The tightening is protagonist-driven: shifting from passive, dreamlike creation to active, technical anchoring under threat. Prices are visible (blood, exhaustion), and the wind’s aftermath validates the risk. A secondary antagonistic pressure (community skepticism or competing path) could have sharpened the turn further.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on recovering faith through reconstruction; escalation deepens with the discovery, the slow freeing, and the final placement revealing the carving. Pressure remains coherent and grows in a quiet register appropriate to the lens. The visible price is endurance and the relinquishing of tidy answers rather than a sharper trade-off. One meaningful tightening is present and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—transmit a fabricated identity without digital surveillance—is present and tightens from planning to chalk deployment to sealing the letter. The pressure is conceptual and one‑way; no active counterforce arrives, so escalation remains subtle rather than contested. The cost is clear (risk, uncertainty, time) but largely inferred. The final commitment narrows options plausibly, though with limited on‑page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (thwarting a coup) is clear and tightened by the three‑minute window, with a genuine timing squeeze and a momentary lag creating a credible pinch. Agency drives the turn: synchronizing her burst with the alignment handshake. The visible price is mostly implied (risk of discovery, the foreclosed path of safety), and on‑page resistance is light beyond the lag. Still, pressure coheres and grows appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular: clarity at the genesis of regret. Pressure coheres as the spirits’ song intensifies and the condensation text accumulates to the crucial dissolution of “sorry,” with visible costs (Elara’s depletion, Kael’s rupture of understanding). Agency is largely Elara’s endurance and method rather than a contested choice, but the tightening is real. The refusal to “fix” functions as an earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (humanizing the General to enable peace) is signaled early and tightens through the act of decoding and the decision to share a vulnerable truth. The escalation is quiet but coherent: from private deciphering to public exposure of Anja’s fear, narrowing options for Varin’s emotional posture. The on‑page price is subtle—risking trust by revealing “secrets”—and could be sharper, but it reads. The final beat locks a new, cost‑tinged poise between father and mediator.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are simple but focused: recover joy without destroying the delicate memory. Escalation arrives via the fragility of the “exposed film” logic and the turn when the fragment is employed, narrowing options and solving the wobble without removing cost. The price—acceptance of impermanence—is felt in the dissolve. Pressure is quiet but coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates through a pattern of trial‑and‑refinement toward the seven‑strike “masterpiece” that collapses options and returns him changed. Stakes are intimate—certainty vs curiosity—so the tightening is a deepening rather than a hard squeeze. The decisive act comes from his agency and learned constraints. The price is mostly conceptual, so tension is elegant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear early and escalate coherently: surveillance evolves (“active probes”), sirens approach, and the plan’s ethical risk sharpens choice. The decisive act forecloses safer paths and generates a palpable, if temporary, reprieve. The price is felt conceptually more than viscerally; we don’t witness immediate fallout beyond silence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to live with relentless wakefulness/loneliness—tightens when pain’s “texture shifts,” pushing a redefinition of practice. The decisive move (enshrining the postcard and changing how the songs go out) forecloses an old path (hiding poems in other shells). Pressure escalates texturally rather than through plot reversals, in line with the chosen lens. The price is enduring insomnia and embracing visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are stated early (save Simple Trust before it vanishes), and escalation arrives via the search for resonance, pitch adjustments, and the final breath. Pressure remains internal and art‑driven; there is no external opposition, so the test reads as delicate rather than perilous. The cost is felt in the aftermath—archiving equals loss—but the on‑page risk of failure remains mostly conceptual. The single tightening suffices for the length but never truly forecloses a live option beyond delay.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and clear: last chance to repair trust. Escalation occurs via the risky clause modification, the loop‑closing act, and the symphony’s manifestation, culminating in Elara’s entrance. The peril (cascading promises might shatter him) tightens pressure, though the on-page price is more signaled than exacted. The outcome remains appropriately tentative, preserving cost in the charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling duty and love—tightens through discovery steps that narrow ambiguity into proof. The meaningful deepening is the ciphered chain leading to the cache, culminating in the letters that force a stance shift. Cost is internal and legible (the loss of a long‑held story about his father). Pressure is coherent though relatively gentle; one minor beat of resistance would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving Lena’s music vs. risking self by telling the truth—is tested under real pressure. The storm provides a credible escalation that narrows options and forces a choice; Anna’s stabilizing hand focuses the internal conflict. The cost of vulnerability is explicit and reorients the relationship. Tension operates at sentence and beat scales without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—choosing irrevocable separation to honor the sacred threshold—tightens from discovery to commitment. The formation of the white gateway is a credible pressure point; the north‑edge constraint narrows options. Cost is visible and conceptually sharp. A brief beat of counter‑pull (the temptation not to cross) could have heightened the final squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (prove the pattern to break isolation before departure) is clear, and escalation arrives through the density and synchronization of lights. Kaelen’s agency (dim lights, choose the Dome) drives the turn; Elara’s shift validates the risk. The price paid is primarily internal, not situational, so the tightening feels gentle rather than knife‑edge. Still, the cadence shift is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear early (finish before the memory fades), and pressure tightens when the vine map stops and then begins to recede. Kael’s final choice is agency‑driven and time‑bound, creating an effective single escalation. The price is largely procedural (risk of permanent loss) rather than moral or relational, so the felt cost is modest. Still, the narrowing of options is legible and coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from monotony—is clear, and pressure coheres around the incoming tide as a live clock. Escalation is a single tightening sequence rather than contested struggle; success feels largely pre‑secured by competence. The “because/therefore” chain works, but cost and risk are muted. The couple’s reaction provides a small external validation spike.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—write the cosmic verse—tightens from failure to a focused inward tactic that catalyzes a shift. The decisive deepening (choosing the inner “gaps”) leads to anchoring and success. Prices and foreclosed options are lightly gestured (risk of the ban, permanence of inscription) rather than felt through a concrete consequence. Tension is real but primarily contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular and legible: the atrium’s future versus fidelity to a new reality. Pressure escalates via the pond’s interference lesson, narrowing options and making “do nothing/save nothing” an earned, costly stance. The cost is felt: he forecloses the path of preservation in favor of principle. Slight softness in external jeopardy (no immediate physical dismantling) is offset by clear internal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (can Elias meaningfully pass on the cost calculus) is signaled early and deepens via the fire choice. Escalation is quiet but present: the naming of “bargained innocence” crystallizes the pressure and reconfigures Kaelen’s stance. Cost is unmistakable (scar, surrendered perfection), though external pressure remains low. The final acceptance gesture functions as earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake: whether the trial will stabilize a dying timeline’s vitality. Escalation concentrates at the needle’s plunge—a meaningful tightening that tests her method and resolve—before the controlled ascent. The price is primarily risk and expended resources; no external antagonist or hard trade‑off appears. Nevertheless, the turn is earned and legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are ethically scaled: whether to claim, expose, or leave the burden. Pressure coheres and tightens through the discovery sequence toward a single renunciation that forecloses a path. The price is felt but subtle; we don’t see tangible fallout beyond the chosen restraint. Even so, escalation reads as a decisive intensification appropriate to the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the pre‑bell window; escalation stems from the lullaby intensifying into city‑wide reflections. The single tightening is the clock; when the bell strikes, the option closes. Stakes remain intimate and aesthetic, not existential, so cost feels refined rather than visceral. Still, the methodical buildup to the chime provides a clean hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit and pressure coheres: exhaustion versus habitual war. The beat where consensus frays and Elias must “muster something more” is a genuine tightening that forces a new tactic. The cost is palpable though mostly implied (loss of warrior identity, humility). Tension escalates cleanly to the twin signatures without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: committing a final, irrevocable act as penance. Escalation is subtle—thunder’s lull to return, the tactile handling to release—more deepening than reversal. The visible price (destroying the last egg) is unmistakable, though resistance in the moment is muted. The tightening suffices for this length under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (free the echoes to disrupt conformity) and tightens toward the judge’s knot. The escalation is primarily textural via the dance’s sequence, with the keystone providing a single meaningful intensification. Price is muted—little sense of risk or sacrifice beyond exertion and the conceptual shock delivered to the city. The resolution is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ethical responsibility vs artistic method—is clear early and tightens with the remembered audience member and Elara’s accusation. The meaningful turn is the vow to answer the prior show, not retract, which reweights risk. Cost is felt but subtle (no tidy absolution, acceptance of possible harm). Slight softening from limited external opposition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (commemoration) is clear and tightens when the migration proves a trickle and he races to finish the culminating knot. Pressure escalates via density and timing rather than antagonist; the last male’s pass converts the tension. The price—accepting extinction without intervening—reads on the page. Slight limitation: conflict remains quiet, with one primary deepening rather than layered turns.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (recover/honor Lyra’s name) and the meaningful tightening comes when he locks the final strand, triggering the rope. Pressure remains mostly internal and textural, with limited explicit risk or jeopardy beyond failure to realize sound. The trade-off—light not sound—registers, but the escalation is intentionally quiet rather than sharpened by competing options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early (unlocking/understanding before collapse), with a meaningful tightening when the ceiling cracks and water pours in. The dream‑won reframe creates the crucial narrowing from “break” to “ingest,” and the act forecloses retreat. Cost is immediate and felt; his transcendence does not rescue him from the physical price. No extraneous reversals; pressure coheres under the storm clock.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncloaking a secret—stays clear, with a meaningful tightening at the alignment moment and the tile’s placement. Pressure is largely internal and procedural; there’s little counterforce beyond time and precision. The price (solitary knowledge; renunciation of worldly stakes) is legible but soft. Tension works at a quiet, sentence‑scale cadence rather than through hard reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: Vale’s violent recoil escalates to the sanctuary tearing, forcing a cure‑or‑perish decision. The dominant stake—a universe stabilized through convincing Vale—remains legible and narrows options at the peak. Cost is felt in the risk of collapse and Elara’s fading. The catalyst’s arrival is a slight softener, though Elara’s decision to “press it into the memory” sustains agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is tight: remake the dream on her terms. Pressure coheres through a single deepening—the breath‑guided crystallization—culminating in a shattering that tests her intent. Agency is continuous and the price (ephemerality, relinquishing possession) is legible. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—saving the Heartwood and reconciling with Lyra’s ethos—tightens from failed force to a risky reframe. The rummage-to-seed pivot is the meaningful deepening that changes options and knowledge. The cost is internal but legible (abandoning an identity-bound method), and the resolution is protagonist-driven. Pressure is steady rather than punishing, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around the need to reconcile paradox with the proscription against understanding, escalating into a focused inquiry decision that cannot be undone. The tightening manifests as a shift from awe-struck overwhelm to disciplined mental inquiry, culminating in accepting a conduit role. The price—relinquishing the fantasy of authorship—reads, though not dramatically punished in-scene. Stakes remain internal but clear and grow coherently under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent and early: access the forbidden library to avert a warned future. Pressure tightens when the trail ends at a silenced wall, forcing renegotiation with superior powers. The on-page price is mostly reputational/existential, but the turn is protagonist-driven and closure is earned. A sharper on-page consequence would elevate intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and legible early (find the Garden/reclaim him), and the pressure deepens as her own memories are rewritten, narrowing the emotional path forward. The choice to deploy the final, darkest swatch is a credible escalation driven by her agency. The cost is unmistakable: when the wave of sensation recedes, what remains is loneliness and foreclosed solace. The tightening is sufficient at this length, with no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (integrate the anomaly without breaking reality), and there is one meaningful tightening when he commits to reconfiguring the rope within the clockwork. Pressure remains low: no counterforce, time limit, or real risk surfaces on the page. The resolution is earned but pays little visible price. Tension is more ceremonial than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: wrest silence from invasive noise. Pressure coheres and tightens as he moves deeper, the hum sharpens, and the ritual risks collapse (stone flares, cave shudders). The price is felt but not harrowing; consequences are primarily somatic and environmental, not moral or relational. Still, the decisive narrowing at the ritual beat is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: break the silence to signal others. Pressure tightens via the rare alignment and the internal crisis at the keystone beat; the “hush” threatens to reaffirm isolation. Escalation is modest but coherent and driven by his agency. The price is primarily emotional rather than material, but it’s felt in the risk of losing his meaning structure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering the core memory vs. safeguarding collective survivability—tightens through the lightning‑driven measurement to the unified chime and revelation. The ethical calculus at the end is a clear costed renunciation. Pressure is coherent and grows under the causal lens; no luck resolution beyond the taught lightning constraint. Slightly internalized conflict, but it integrates with the external task.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding a cure/answer to the hush) is present early and tightens when hours of searching fail, then turns on the rag knot insight which reframes tactics. Escalation is textural rather than antagonistic, yet pressure deepens credibly from discouragement to pattern recognition. Costs are more conceptual than visceral; no strong foreclosed alternative beyond relinquishing the “single magical formula.” Still, the tightening beat is clear and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear early (terms of their bond) and pressure coheres through the live pause. Escalation reads as a density increase culminating in the conceptual turn; the cost is moving from closeness to a diffuse continuity. The tightening is quiet but real: choosing a reframed bond forecloses the path of confrontation or clinging. A slightly sharper external counter‑pressure from Kael could have intensified the crunch.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a silence that won’t suffocate—tightens under a live clock and the physical/emotional exposure of open sky. The ascent tests commitment (fight the instinct to curl), and the return carries a new interior resource that changes the cost of rooms. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the meaningful tightening is the lurch as gravity returns. The price remains primarily internal, but it’s legible and carried forward.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the passenger can endure and reframe the hush—appears early and remains coherent. Escalation is a deepening via guided attention, culminating in her physiologic and verbal shift; it’s persuasive if gentle. The price is inward (relinquishing panic’s shield), but options aren’t meaningfully narrowed beyond that. A single, subtle tightening lands rather than a true reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake and ticking clock are established early and tighten as dawn approaches; peeling successive layers provides progressive pressure. The meaningful turn is the reveal that the throne is a system keyed by the shard, not a seat for a person. Escalation is steady rather than surprising, with minimal setback or counterpressure beyond time. The price (foregoing the crown and risking failure under a deadline) reads, but could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (reopen a path to breath/connection) are clear; pressure tightens when she decides “It was time to encroach” and channels feeling rather than words. The escalation is primarily internal and textural, culminating in Liam’s breath and the conduit image. Costs are present but gentle; the piece avoids a harder trade‑off or foreclosed option on the page. Quiet, coherent tension without a major reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (stabilize or contain an unstable Promise) and escalates coherently as she approaches and engages the flaw. The tightening is a single, meaningful turn at the lattice node; agency drives the outcome. Cost is primarily psychic with little visible price or complication after commitment, keeping tension strong but not punishing. No reversal beyond internal temptation reduces bite.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (truth) is clear; escalation is the hum’s mounting pressure and her insistence in turning. The meaningful deepening is the emotional transmission that forecloses the old path of power and the search itself. Cost is conceptual (accepting dismantlement as protection) and legible; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (prevent dissolution/capture possibility) tightens as the orchard destabilizes and the dance demands precision. The marked asterisk step and timed unsnapping create a clear narrowing of options with real risk. The price—severing a sustaining tether—reads on the page and reconfigures his status. A touch more resistance or a failed attempt before the peak could heighten escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can translate private grief into meaningful custodianship—tightens through the physical act of unfurling and the ethical choice to conspire with historical empathy. The reveal escalates pressure from curiosity to responsibility, producing a clear change in options (to officially reunite object and meaning). The cost is subtle but legible (continuing ache, duty assumed). Quiet, but coherent and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—seeding truth against a revisionist regime while avoiding detection—is clear and narrows through the off-grid route and causeway approach. Escalation is quiet but coherent: leaving monitored corridors for abandoned marshes raises risk and forecloses retreat. The final act (activating the node) is Elara’s, with consequences rippling citywide. A sharper on-page price (e.g., immediate trace or sacrifice) would heighten felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit early; escalation occurs as the random drip resolves into code, and he adapts by framing silence. The sympathetic resonance and light shift mark a meaningful tightening that undercuts the prophecy’s pattern. Prices are stamina and solitude rather than a tangible sacrifice; no major reversal beyond the falter. Tension stays coherent and deepens within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (unlocking the message) tightens when the anomalous leaf appears and the moonstone is placed; the prod is a clear agency point. Escalation is more tonal than perilous; risk and trade‑off are implied rather than tested. The payoff is decisive but achieved with little resistance. Pressure coheres, but the felt price is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: puzzle-solving tightens into a single significant turn (aligning the rose to open the passage) and deepens into the cavern’s revelation. The dominant stake—seeking the true purpose beyond broken clocks—tightens once rather than escalating through multiple reversals, which fits the scope. Cost is present but quiet, landing as renunciation. Tension remains more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (redeem/understand, not resurrect) is set early and tightens as the ritual demands perfect balance under intensifying pressure. The fracture‑to‑light surge is a meaningful turn with a real price (energy depletion, acceptance over impossible desire). Stakes remain internal but are rendered viscerally enough to read as consequential. No contrived antagonism or coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (help the spirit move on through reframing) is clear, and pressure coheres as the harp’s discord spikes into a shriek when confronted. The meaningful tightening occurs when Silas demands a joyful confession; that shifts options and unlocks release. The price remains modest—no visible loss beyond endurance—so escalation feels controlled rather than harrowing. Agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—endure and derive meaning vs. be dissolved by the crucible—is signaled early and tightens at the clearing. The bracing act and ensuing revelation function as the key deepening that narrows options toward acceptance. Cost is implied (remaining in the experiment’s frame) rather than dramatized as a tangible loss. One visible sacrifice would heighten the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (liberate a suppressed history) is clear, and pressure tightens from discovery to an active, strenuous unfastening. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn and resolution. The price is primarily psychic/energetic (the “silent, wrenching pull”), credible but not harrowing. Still, the deepening from seeing to altering reality is a meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres and tightens after the power cut, with a clear choice that alters outcomes. The primary stake is whether Leo engages and risks stepping into the liminal pressure to resolve the tethered spirit. Escalation is quiet but real, culminating in the ladder ascent and reach into the ceiling. The on‑page price remains understated, keeping the ceiling of intensity just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberate/change a perfect system—tightens through the controlled frost ritual into the rupture. Agency drives escalation; the whisper is used deliberately, not coincidentally, and the hum-to-rupture sequence is a decisive intensification. Cost is made plain (loss of perfect stasis, disintegration into information) with a consequential new status quo. Internal friction is muted, so felt risk is more conceptual than visceral, but the pressure still coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reframing the First Ones) tightens as the storm turns the shard from artifact to witness, altering Kaelen’s options. The on‑page reversal is discovery‑driven rather than agonistic; pressure coheres but remains mostly conceptual. The choice to leave only the shard uncovered reads as a tactical risk that earns the reveal. The price is implied (mental peril, academic backlash) more than felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and early: the world’s frequency against the covenant of rust. Escalation centers on the rust’s psychological strike—his slip and the chip’s dimming—narrowing options to an internal recommitment that enables the final turn. The cost is primarily psychic (overcoming self-doubt), but it is dramatized and alters the outcome. The tightening is clean and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes cohere around discovery versus capture, tightening at the maze (compass fails), the psychometry decision, and the hinge reveal. The final choice forecloses a live path—bottling the scent—and sacrifices the compass. Pressure deepens rather than multiplies, in line with the chosen lens. Slight lack of physical jeopardy keeps the escalation just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake (survive/protect the archway) escalates from hum to imminent obliteration with a decisive narrowing of options. The lantern’s last layer forces a trade: time and effort under a live clock to shape the bulwark, paying physical cost and risking failure. Agency drives the outcome; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The wave’s division provides a crisp, earned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the night bloom truth—tightens through the layered glass method; the filter sequence provides a decisive deepening. Escalation is agency‑driven (returning at night with tools), culminating in the portrait reveal. The price is subtle (time, solitude, inherited burden) and could be sharper on the page. Still, pressure coheres and grows within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake (unlocking the diary via parley); the meaningful tightening is the shift from asking about conflict to meaning/aftermath. The phantom’s slight nod is a subtle but effective reversal, leading to new knowledge. Costs are mostly psychic/endurance rather than a foreclosed option, which keeps the intensity just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—authenticity versus despair/false comfort—are signaled early and escalate via the first and second successful creations and the felt cost. The tightening arrives as a practical limit (working memory strain) that narrows pace and scope, sharpening the choice to continue. While there’s no hard reversal, the cadence shift from observation to creation to vowed endurance suffices at this length. Cost is legible and integrated with the method.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stake (protect the city from emotion‑eaters) coheres and tightens through the whispered revelation. The reversal—foghorn as ward, archive as lure—forces a costly stance: renounce his purpose to save people. Pressure is largely internal but credible for this length and lens. A concrete external impediment is absent, keeping escalation a hair shy of severe.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (save the pocket reality) is explicit and the escalation is a steady cadence shift from chaos to thrum, driven by her chosen method. There’s one meaningful tightening as the acorn draws heat and the vortex slows. The conflict remains largely unopposed internally or externally; no reversal or explicit trade‑off is forced. Cost and risk are implied rather than dramatized, which limits peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (drown the sky vs hear it) is signaled early and narrows via the countdown and power spool-up. The tightening is credible and driven by Elian’s agency (diversion, manual tuning). The visible price at the moment is subdued; consequences are implied more than felt. Tension still operates at beat and sentence levels toward a resonant resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (find strength in vulnerability) escalates when he chooses to shift from tracing to empathizing, accepting the star’s terror. The cost is legible—he submits to fear and reconfiguration to earn the “overwhelming glory.” Pressure coheres without contrivance, culminating in a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, apt for the length. A minor added resistance pre‑turn could further sharpen the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (freeing Lyra/ending the punitive silence) is stated early and tightens through Lyra’s pointed cue. The key turn is the decision to open the box, which forecloses his protective misbelief. The price is legible—surrendering his sacred silence and releasing her; tension is maintained through pressure rather than reversals. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear early (recover time’s felt texture) and tightens with the arrival of the glass‑shard message. Escalation is internal and method‑driven rather than adversarial, but the cadence shift is meaningful when he risks belief by pressing the shard to the panel. The resolution is earned by his prior tactics (garage‑sale messages) rather than luck alone. The price—trading anxiety for stasis—reads more as relief than sacrifice, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: how to respond to a small grief without platitude. Pressure deepens via a textural escalation—the snap, the search, the find—culminating in a chosen stance of tending aftermath rather than mending. The cost is subtle (foregoing direct comfort and accepting irretrievability), appropriate to scope. No hard reversal, but the cadence shift suffices for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—achieve communion before time runs out—tightens through bodily weakening, the web’s gradual completion, and the last conductive insertion. Escalation is quiet but legible: from method to orchestration to ignition. Cost is present (spent stamina, acceptance of end), though antagonistic push is minimal. The final act reads as a decisive, self-imposed test rather than a foregone ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the footprints’ pull, the social stillness in the tower, and the internal wager on skepticism narrow toward a single charged act. The cost is clear (letting go of the protective isolation symbol), and the decision forecloses a path. Escalation arrives as density increase rather than external obstruction, fitting the chosen lens. A slight lack of external antagonism keeps the stakes intimate rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the dead sea’s edge—remains coherent and grows via the birds’ instructions and the practical constraints of rock and salt. The tightening is primarily textural: selecting sites and seeds under time (twilight) and scarcity (limited soil, satchel contents). Cost is present but soft; there’s little direct opposition or reversal. Resulting cadence is compelling yet low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes consolidate early (will she translate absence into presence?) and tighten through a meaningful turn when the audio “failure” becomes a groove‑riddle. Escalation is steady—decoding labor, two‑day trek, fissure that looks like “nothing,” and the hinged reveal—culminating in a reweighted aim. The price (abandoning safety, time, stamina) is felt though not catastrophic. A touch more friction or risk on the journey could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding a viable stance toward time’s distortion—tightens as the sensory pattern breaks (pulsar pulse lag), culminating in the glimpse. While largely internal, escalation is coherent and the final choice (embracing exploratory agency over fixed direction) forecloses the comfort of inherited certainty. Price is more conceptual than visceral, but it reads on the page. No antagonist needed; pressure comes from the environment and her altered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early (amend the paradox’s confinement by changing Sylas’s stance), and the light‑show swap is a solid tightening beat. Pressure, however, remains gentle; Sylas is distracted easily and there’s little tangible risk or setback. The price is implied (relinquishing control) more than felt on the page, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (freeing the hidden prisoner/altering the Regent’s stance) tightens through patterned attempts and a culminating risk-laden performance. The escalation from “SECRET” to “RELEASE” to “UNBIND” constitutes a clear deepening. Cost is felt (exposure to excision; moral rupture for the Regent). Slight neatness in the Regent’s compliance keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—can she stop fleeing and find a livable definition of home—are signaled early and cohere. Escalation is gentle but real: the inciting touch, prolonged search under internal pressure, the inert stone setback, then the feather method as a tightening choice. The price is emotional exposure and abandoning the coping pattern of nightly substitution, visible in the trembling/precipice beat. The resolution grows from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens as the tapestry’s frayed cipher reframes the fatal game, forcing a trade-off between brilliance and safety. The deepening occurs when he maps threads to moves and recognizes the “cowardly” defense. The price (ego surrender) is clear and the external consequence heightens it. Escalation is measured rather than volatile, but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: resist the Absolution’s monolithic truth at personal cost. Pressure coheres and deepens via the horn and the imminent ritual, forcing a last performance that forecloses safety. The cost is on‑page, and the refracted cacophony materially alters the field of meaning. A single, well‑timed tightening beat is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes are clear and tighten: the clock of a single breath, doubt cresting at the heart crater, and the leviathan’s shadow escalate pressure. The turn is Elara’s refusal to narrate annihilation and choice to narrate dignity; it forecloses the path of collapse. Costs are visible (risk of suffocation, loss of certainty) and paid before the release. Resolution arises from her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and clear: find a place worthy of “forever” and enact the parting. The wrong turn is a meaningful tightening that reweights options rather than resolving by luck; he accepts it and commits. The price—relinquishing the object and fixing the memory in a specific place—lands, though pressure remains gently lyrical. No antagonist is needed; internal and environmental pressures suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (guiding the Stellaria) are clear and the pressure tightens through his sustained act of will against time and fog. The meaningful turn is Elias choosing intention over loudness; minutes stretch until the ship appears—an accumulative escalation. The visible price is more spiritual than material, and no option is foreclosed beyond abandoning the foghorn approach. Tension remains coherent, if gentle, with a decisive deepening rather than a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can he build a beacon that offers a path home) is clear; pressure coheres through the ticking midnight call and moon‑limited opportunity. The tightening arrives with the instruction and the irreversible placement, foreclosing the fantasy of personal retrieval in favor of communal solace. Escalation is modest but real; the price is internal and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting a private truth—tightens through the storm ritual and is tested by the neighbor. The meaningful turn is the mental “click” under peak turmoil, narrowing his options thereafter. Cost is present but subtle; the piece hints at an ongoing price in that “severance” and the season’s barter. Tension operates at sentence and scene scale without needing reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (to decode the final gesture) is clear and tightens through the ritualized nightly sessions. The escalation is primarily textural, culminating in the interpretive click and the museuming of the flower. Cost is felt but internal; little is foreclosed beyond an emotional stance shift. Tension is continuous but gentle, befitting the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (fulfilling Elara’s promise/what to do at the doorway) tightens as the creek rises and the archway manifests. The key deepening is the vision of alternate lives, which forces a tradeoff and a refusal with cost. Pressure remains coherent without an antagonist. Stakes are felt more internally than physically, but the price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape into oblivion versus duty—tightens as the grotto reveals the exact price of touch. The escalation is clean: prophecy pressure → ascent → immersion in the peril → hand poised → Kael’s intervention → renunciation. The cost is unmistakable and persists beyond the page. A single, sharp tightening at the brink provides sufficient pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central pressure tightens when Kael announces he’s leaving, forcing a real trade-off: perfection vs presence. Elara’s agency escalates the scene—she discards her talisman and alters method, paying a visible price. Stakes remain coherent and intimate, and the new sun doesn’t erase the loss. The conflict is internal/external braid done cleanly at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—regain narrative coherence vs psychic consumption—is clear and tightens through the trance to the flight, which functions as the decisive deepening. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn and the resolution (choosing to write). The cost is internal (renouncing a defining resentment), which reads but isn’t deeply taxing on the page. Tension operates more lyrically than oppositional but sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: can Elara translate an object into human meaning. The tightening comes as she takes the screw and commits to an interpretive risk, culminating in the old man’s realization and her own internal repricing. Costs are quiet but felt (risk of failure; living with loss). Escalation is primarily deepening rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around the held breath and the spreading crystal; the meaningful tightening occurs when anxiety spikes and ink fails, pushing a tactical pivot. Stakes remain intimate but real: bodily harm versus identity as a scholar. The price—abandoning sanctioned methods and naming painful sources—reads on the page. Escalation is more internal than external, but it stays legible and purposeful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates with the device’s activation into a visceral, high-cost beat that narrows options to endurance and apology. The deluge forces a trade: relinquish ideal reconnection in favor of acceptance. Pressure coheres from external clock to internal flood. Slightly limited by the absence of a second tightening turn beyond the main surge.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—selfhood vs. dissolution—escalates via the spiral approach and the reinterpreted definition that narrows options toward merger. The decisive tightening is the move from witnessing to becoming. Stakes stay internal yet coherent; the cost is legible. Slightly limited by a lack of a mid‑scene reversal beyond deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—maintain pure precision versus heed the machine’s message—tightens through the anomaly’s emergence and the shard’s reveal. The counting ritual escalates attention; the discovery deepens stakes and reweights options. The renunciation provides resolution with a felt conceptual price. Pressure remains quiet; a hint more immediate operational risk would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—release—tightens toward the press and release of the button. Agency drives the turn; the price is letting the familiar stranger pass with no reunion. Pressure is quiet but coherent, with a single decisive intensification at the permeable opening. A hint more on‑page wavering could have amplified tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on whether Aris will relinquish pure probabilistic control for a lived risk; pressure coheres as the weeks‑long quest narrows to a final statement. The meaningful tightening is the move from circulating trains to the off‑map maintenance stairwell and balcony. Cost is primarily internal; we don’t see a tangible sacrifice beyond stance, which slightly limits intensity. Still, the final act (lighting the lantern) is a decisive acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are focused: reframing a crisis call without offering comfort. Pressure deepens through iterative looping, culminating in the caller’s own restated realization; the cadence shift is meaningful under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible (Silas’s chosen solitude; the caller’s acceptance of a different grammar rather than hope). Escalation is subtle but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes cohere around revealing and reweighting the founders’ truth to heal a feud; escalation tightens via the restoration gamble and the decision to go to the boundary. Agency drives the turn (the steep, the walk, the reveal), though pressure feels gentle rather than coercive. The miraculous blooming functions as intensification rather than a solution. Felt price is primarily conceptual and historical, not personally risky.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—loneliness versus the risk of engagement—are signaled early and tightened at the “point of polite anarchy.” The key turn is Silas declining the easy myth and stepping into the circle, which narrows options and sets a price. Pressure is quiet but coherent, with social hesitation replacing overt antagonism. One sharper on‑page obstacle could have intensified the cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres through accumulation: each found note tightens the quest and quiets internal chaos. The penultimate-to-final note beat is a meaningful deepening as he dowses “the space between things,” narrowing options. Cost is borne as endurance under sonic pressure and the acceptance that grief persists. Stakes remain single and focused without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: fix the colony’s past or learn to live with the cost. Escalation tightens as each attempted “edit” produces a different disaster, narrowing viable options toward an ethically loaded refusal. The renunciation is active agency with a felt price. Pressure is coherent and grows to a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—disrupt the harbor’s crushing stillness—tightens credibly when Lyra pushes him to the “place where the forgetting is total” and at “Now.” The escalation is a clear density increase culminating in his most complex verse. Cost is mostly emotional and conceptual (expenditure of self, Lyra’s dissipation) rather than materially constraining, but it is legible on the page. Tension is sustained through cadence and choice rather than antagonist mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering and honoring Elara’s truth—tightens with the vandal’s initials (rage spike) and the reveal that destruction has been integrated into the art. The key turn is Kaelen choosing creation over retaliation, foreclosing the prior path of arsonous vengeance. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but coherent under the causal lens. The price is primarily internal and credible for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure mounts via density and pattern: the hush, the sneaking, the ramping rhythm that forces the lagoon to surface. Stakes are single and coherent (make the dream real despite captivity), and the visible price is loneliness. External opposition is muted, but the scene still tightens credibly under the accumulative lens. The bridge section functions as a meaningful deepening that tests commitment and extracts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (find XB-734’s manifest under time/tech pressure) is clear. Escalation occurs through navigation choice and puzzle-solve, but obstacles never bite back; no meaningful trade-off or lost option. The coin flip is intriguing but low-cost, and success arrives at first attempt beats. Earned, but with limited tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent and focused (soothe or instruct the darkness), and pressure tightens through the patterning and the single bright mote. The brief wait after the light descends credibly escalates tension; the bloom-and-fade reply is a quiet reversal. The price is subtle—ongoing watch and a crack left open—but not deeply felt as a sacrifice. Still, the decisive tactic emerges from character and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—resisting homogeny via quiet, collective display—is signaled early and coherently escalates toward the synchronized reveal. The ninth bell serves as a real tightening. Pressure remains mostly atmospheric; no direct pushback or explicit price is paid on the page, keeping the stakes conceptual rather than visceral. Nevertheless, the shift in the town’s stance and Maya’s activated agency provide a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (freedom vs. home) and escalates from argument to transgressive ritual to irrevocable departure. The night act narrows options and forecloses a path, with Elara’s plea sharpening the choice. Cost is legible in the separation and her acceptance. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres through desire, taboo, and the island’s awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: protect a private grief under a punitive regime, with guilt as secondary pressure. Escalation is a tonal tightening (from performed levity to private making to consecration). The clear turn is the choice to stop narrating and engage in the riskier, more intimate act. Costs—complicity and danger—are legible, though the external threat remains ambient rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes cohere (understand without being unmoored) and escalate via a deepening of method (dissolution) toward a reweighting of options. The meaningful tightening is the choice to let go of identity boundaries, risking the edicts’ “madness.” Pressure remains largely internal and aesthetic, so the felt price is moderate rather than acute. Still, the final stance is clearly earned by Kael’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (Lyra’s awakening) are clear early, and pressure coheres through one meaningful tightening: from deciphering “a sound perfectly whole” to executing the flawless build and breath. Agency drives the turns; coincidence doesn’t solve anything. Still, the path is relatively smooth—no failed attempt, sacrifice, or explicit risk—and cost remains soft, keeping tension on the gentle side. The success reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (restoring connection) are signaled early, and escalation comes via the interpretive turn to vision and the consequent technical adaptation. The pressure reads as internal and procedural rather than adversarial; it builds, but conflict is low-friction once the new tactic is chosen. The decisive tightening is the retune-to-photons choice that forecloses the prior path. A sharper on-page cost or failed iteration would have deepened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can redirect grief into guidance—tightens through the origami sequence toward the risk of spending the stencil in public. The final escalation is a deliberate reveal that forecloses hoarding his pain and invites shared sight, with a visible emotional price. Pressure is coherent but intentionally soft; there’s no hard reversal, just a decisive deepening, which suits the lens. A slight lack of on‑page jeopardy keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (understanding “why”) are clear, and pressure coheres toward Elara’s confiding. Escalation is a deepening rather than a sharp narrowing; the key tightening is the reveal of her father’s project and the inherited mission. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than a foreclosed option, which softens impact. Still, the cadence shift reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—knowing vs. self‑erasure—tightens as the ritual succeeds, memories flood, and the civilization’s fate reframes the risk. Agency drives escalation; her adherence to unpredictability and choice to complete the ritual foreclose retreat. The price (identity dilution, permanent vesselhood) is felt on the page. No antagonist needed; pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (preserving Elara’s true self) are clear early; escalation tightens as observation becomes intervention. The decisive turn is Kael’s integration choice that forecloses deletion and embraces cost. The process runs without overt resistance or a counterbeat testing his resolve, which tempers intensity. Nonetheless, the price (enshrining sorrow) is unmistakable and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: heal the animal and salvage self‑respect through compassionate practice. Pressure coheres and tightens at the prosthetic fitting, with a credible risk (the chameleon’s fear) and the need for perfect calm to avoid harm. The internal shedding sequence functions as a trade‑off: relinquishing justified anger to preserve care. The escalation is quiet but decisive, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—achieve closure without re-injury—tightens via the tunnel’s deepening and the plant empathy amplifying the cost. The key turn is the revelation that the procedure preserved the break, foreclosing the hoped-for path. Agency manifests as a refusal/endurance choice with a visible price (reopened pain; lost illusion). Pressure is coherent and scales within this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is focused early: find the repository of unused love. Escalation is a purposeful deepening—touch, incubation, embodiment as Arthur, then following the light into the theater’s fabric—culminating in an answer. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (the pressure of yearning, breathlessness), which keeps it lower-temperature but still felt. One clear tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular—finding rest/creative freedom—and escalate through density: from chronic psychic static to the meteor’s catalytic revaluation. The tightening is internal but decisive: she ceases using the instrument as a buffer and accepts the cost of hearing, turning it into art. Pressure remains coherent under the chosen lens, though the price is more tender than sharp. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her agency seals the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve the world’s fragile equilibrium without betraying the mission) is signaled and tested. Pressure tightens when the pine-memory begins to tear the dune; agency escalates to the overlapping wave‑function tactic. The synthesis forecloses the path of simple erasure or full restoration. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional, not materially dramatized, which keeps it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes remain internal—understanding or acceptance of his condition—and escalate via the intensifying “hum” and the move toward the cathedral tree. The single tightening is clear: new crystalline wind dialect forces deeper engagement and culminates in reweighted knowledge. However, the price of acceptance is scarcely dramatized, so tension softens after the insight. Still, resolution is earned by his chosen attention and surrender to the sound.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on whether she will claim agency after severance; pressure coheres as the guides escort her only to the brink and then withdraw. The tightening occurs when the ticket “confirms readiness” yet denies automatic passage, forcing a choice. The visible price is solitude and uncertainty. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length, consistent with the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (is safety worth silence’s cost?) is signaled and coherently escalates: the staircase stain tightens pressure, the manager’s offer poses a live fork, and Elias forecloses escape. The final act risks rupture with 313 and ends the protective denial. No antagonist needed; internal and situational pressures braid effectively. Cost is felt in his continued exposure to shared, “unbreathable” quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is established and tightened by the “one final component” clock and the frozen constellations. The decisive act narrows options irreversibly and exacts a clear price (self‑erasure). Pressure is more ritualistic than contested, limiting visceral escalation but fitting the chosen lens. The graceful, non‑explosive collapse maintains tension through inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stake is focused—unlocking Lena’s “Aethelburg”/the reef’s memory—and pressure tightens with the rare environmental alignment and a failed attempt. The pivotal adjustment (adding the heartbeat) is agentive and costly in that success is fleeting, not triumphant. A slightly clearer articulation of what is risked beyond time and sanity would push pressure higher.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ending the lull by reactivating the network—is established early and tightened through the precise alignment and the time constraint. Escalation is a single intensification: the hum blooms, stones answer, then the remote receivers respond. The price of the attempt isn’t strongly tested (no significant opposition or sacrifice on the page), keeping tension elegant but gentler than peak. Resolution is earned by her method, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—successfully unsealing the embryo to seed an alternative destiny—is clear and escalates through precise environmental orchestration. The meaningful tightening arrives at the frequency‑channeling moment where success or failure concentrates. Yet antagonistic pressure is ambient rather than immediate, and the price of success is not palpably paid in scene. As a result, tension is strong but never quite harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she navigate a trigger without losing her capacity to care—is legible from the first paragraph. The tightening arrives with the shadow/thrum and bodily lock; options narrow until she executes her practiced grounding. The price and recovery cadence are clear, culminating in a deliberate, measured act (“just enough”). Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding an ordering method to survive psychic collapse) is signaled early and tightens when he refuses to mend and commits to redesign. Escalation is interior but tangible through labor (“worked for hours,” walls’ pressure receding) and a visible map as outcome. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through a hard trade-off; still, the renunciation of repair and acceptance of pain carry weight. The cadence shift is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (pursuit of the drone’s source/time mystery), and escalation tightens from observation to ritual to disappearance. The drone’s pressure is observational rather than actively resisting, which keeps tension cool rather than acute. The renunciation of rescue efforts is a credible price. A touch more friction at the threshold would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—truth versus stability—is signaled early and tightened by the imminent “purity purge.” Escalation proceeds from discovery to irrevocable action, narrowing options and raising cost. The moral calculus sharpens credibly at the keyboard choice. The resolution is earned by her agency, with consequences poised rather than hand‑waved.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reject or admit violent legacy) is clear early and tightens when she lifts the knife and the father’s world “presses against the dome.” The decisive turn is the sheathing, which entails accepting lineage while denying its power—an on‑page trade‑off. Tension scales at beat and sentence levels without requiring external antagonism. Slight softness remains in the absence of a secondary complication testing the choice after sheathing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressured by an unstable environment and a live constraint (the breaking‑patterns night). Escalation tightens at the hollow of absolute quiet, forcing the “voice silence” method with emotional cost. Still, the path to success features few tests that truly imperil the goal; he adapts fluidly with limited setbacks. The price paid is felt but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake and tightens through Celeste’s structured dismantling of the journalist’s premise. The reversal comes via Davies’s pivot when confronted with the contradictions. The price—risking family exposure and relinquishing the safety of silence—is legible but understated. Stakes are intellectual/emotional rather than visceral, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—hushing Lyra’s digitized distress and ending his hum—is clear early and tightens toward the etching act. Escalation is primarily one decisive deepening at the lab; the price is emotional rather than a hard trade-off. The technician’s presence doesn’t do heavy pressure work, but the pressure remains coherent and culminates in a singular, earned turn. A touch more on-the-page friction or risk would raise the band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—creating meaning without words—is established early and tightens as the mandala grows and onlookers gather. The key deepening beat is placing the tile at the center, which reweights the hush. Pressure rises coherently, but opposition is largely ambient; no real trade‑off beyond effort and risk of nothing happening. The price is felt but quiet, keeping escalation effective but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around the ethical and functional risk of erasing identity to end suffering, tightening as the humming intensifies and the man goes rigid. The decisive act (renaming) narrows options and carries cost. However, opposition is largely unresisted—no real chance of failure appears on the page—so escalation feels controlled rather than perilous. The stakes remain intimate and focused, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether despair hardens or yields to possibility, signaled early by the rust‑colored “note” and the tarot coin. Escalation is a clean build—light, scent, memory—culminating in the bone‑felt applause that triggers Elara’s decisive act. The price is underarticulated: agency wins without an explicit sacrifice beyond rejecting the coin’s arbitration. One sharper consequence (for Julian or Elara) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (can they forge/verify connection?) is signaled early and tightened through the “real test” of the static shock. Escalation is protagonist‑driven—he chooses to risk belief and vulnerability—leading to a narrowing of options as he relinquishes debunking. The cost is emotional and credible for this scope. Tension is continuous at sentence and beat levels without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure grows via density: from faint echoes to overwhelming consciousness, culminating in the surrender to float. The meaningful tightening is her decision to participate rather than observe, foreclosing safety and control. Stakes are primarily internal/epistemic, but the bodily risk provides concrete edges. The price is legible though not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reset the doom-clock or reject it—emerges early and tightens as the sand dwindles and the voices cohere into a single alternative. The decisive turn (placing the final toggle; the whispers resolve; the last grain falls) narrows options and demands a trade-off. The cost is clear in role-renunciation rather than in direct external opposition, which keeps pressure internal but coherent. A sharper on-page consequence or counterforce could heighten the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (rescue/atonement) is signaled early and tightens when “she’s alive” reweights everything and the hunters close in. The meaningful narrowing comes with the coordinates and his choice to erase the code and go—foreclosing hesitation. Internal and external pressures interlock; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. The cost is clear and ongoing rather than neatly spent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure deepens coherently under the accumulative lens: from metallic heartbeat to hammer punctuations to immense silence forcing a stance. The dominant stake—what to do with the broken promise—tightens into an earned renunciation that forecloses a path (“coming back”). The cost is legible as enduring loss transmuted into ongoing obligation. Quiet, but the cadence shift and final readiness render the escalation unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around whether care will reveal and restore the oasis; watering the rose creates a decisive intensification and the repair is a clear tactical commitment. The tightening is credible but gentle, with little external opposition or risk. The felt price is mainly time, effort, and surrender to purpose, not a wrenching trade-off. Still, agency drives the turn and the ending reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (can a seed of light reach Mr. Henderson?) focus early and tighten via the repetitive labor under cold and silence. The escalation is a density increase consistent with the chosen lens, culminating in the blinds’ fractional opening as the earned turn. The price—time, stamina, exposure—is clear on the page. No antagonist is needed; endurance serves as the agency that forecloses the path of inaction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (coexist with returned life) tightens when he enters the forbidden center, triggering the menagerie and panic beat. The hum-enabled steadiness is a clear deepening that alters options and leads to a renunciation choice. Cost is legible: the acceptance of aloneness as preservation rather than escape. It’s internal conflict, but the beats escalate coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (belonging vs. separation) is clear from the outset and tightens when the sun refracts through the installation, reweighting the cost of keeping vs. giving. The decisive action forecloses a path with felt loss. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and escalating under the chosen lens. A single, clean tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (countering divisive influence) is signaled early and tightens at the moment of engagement and the tense wait for effect. The slight de‑escalation in the quad functions as a meaningful shift in options. The price is primarily ongoing exposure and strain rather than a concrete loss, keeping the ceiling just below the highest band. Still, escalation reads cleanly under the causal design.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes are survival versus retrieval of legacy knowledge, tightened when the organ enrages the space and the walls “breathe,” foreclosing retreat. Escalation is coherent; the apparent solution (play the chord) backfires, forcing a higher-stakes, precise action. Agency drives the turn and resolution; the cost is immediate and visceral if not permanently scarring. The narrowing of options is legible at the precipice beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—summoning empathy—tightened by the worsening cold/mist and the disciplined process that corners him into the scratch. The pivotal act is protagonist‑driven and forecloses an alternative path (mere depiction) in favor of wounding the canvas. External opposition is minimal, but the internal tension escalates credibly under the chosen lens. Cost is felt, not just stated, in the post‑act shudder and ache.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the expedition and unlocking sequence. The key tightening is Elias choosing to leave the station into hostile weather and commit the nail—no easy out once pressed. Prices (physical risk, institutional danger) are present but lightly felt at the peak; the aftermath moves briskly to resolution. Still, agency drives each turn without coincidence solving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes concentrate on whether he will accept the “door” and act; escalation occurs through decoding the mesh into language and committing via music. The tightening is clear but quiet; the felt price is mostly internal. The conflict is coherent and interwoven with his identity, though an external counterpressure is light. The final act credibly narrows his path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (keep the sanctuary intact without becoming his father) are signaled early; pressure coheres through eerie markers to a face‑off with the CEO. Escalation is credible and internally driven, with one meaningful tightening when the CEO’s poise fractures. The cost is largely conceptual and interior, not a concrete loss, which keeps the tension just shy of peak sharpness. The market downturn as an exit note slightly softens the on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake (decoding the temple) is pressured by exhaustion and last-resort method, then deepens into a thematic price (accepting lament over solution). The key tightening is the surrender to witnessing and the realization that “not solved” is the point. Escalation is primarily internal and cadence-driven; it works but never quite bites with a hard trade-off in-scene. Still, the cost—relinquishing a generational frame—registers.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently: outer circles to inner maelstrom, then the resisting branch that demands a life-force expenditure. The decisive act (unbending) exacts cost and yields new knowledge (his fear), which reweights the stake. The seed planting is an added price and commitment rather than a convenience. Stakes remain singular and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (avoid the false intersection, find a true vector). Escalation hinges on agency: she refuses the siren spiral, applies the clipping’s logic, and transmits the new path. The cost is felt but modestly scaled; the piece avoids soft resets. Pressure coheres without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure tightens when the void tendril “trammels” the root, and Aris must choose a non‑violent, personally costly tactic. The price is clear: he parts with a cherished, identity‑defining memory and accepts an ongoing debt (“He would return tomorrow…”). The escalation is coherent and internal/external conflicts interlock. Only one main turn, but at this length it’s sufficient and well earned.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—can he face what remains after failure—and tightens through the cloth snag/wrest/rip progression. The physical escalation catalyzes the emotional cost; the final choice not to catalog the cloth forecloses a path of pure insulation. Stakes remain intimate but felt; the deepening is sufficient for this length and mode. A touch more on-page risk or competing pull in the final beat could heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (can understanding reconfigure loss?) is signaled early and deepens via the decision to plant at the central node and the hum’s subtle shift. Pressure accrues through ritual and patience, culminating in the luminous sprout that reweights options. Costs are mostly internal and conceptual, but clear enough under the chosen lens. The absence of external antagonism is felt but not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through ritual transformation—is clear and tightens with the rising tide and identity migration. The cost is borne in the empathetic heat and the surrender of one persona to another. Escalation reads as a decisive intensification rather than reversal, fitting the lens. Lack of a credible alternative path keeps pressure from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve isolation vs. broadcast connection—tightens from discovery to a single, costly act. The hesitation beat is a clear escalation that forces stance crystallization; want conflicts credibly with fear/duty. Cost is felt rather than tallied, but its consequence is legible in the forfeiture of role and system intent. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early; pressure coheres as the search narrows into the lavatory’s message, then the instrument choice. The meaningful tightening arrives at the graffiti and culminates in the act of leaving the accordion, a visible price. Internal and external tracks interweave cleanly without artificial antagonists. Stakes feel intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and present early: extract the essential unspoken before the second letter arrives. Escalation accrues via density and constraint—cycles tighten, repositioning narrows options, phrases grow more intimate until “Stay.” The library’s dissolution closes paths with consequence. While conflict is primarily internal/procedural, the pressure remains coherent and paid with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—sanctify a lie or plant a living truth—is signaled early and tightens via two converging proofs (vine memory and coffee fissures). The cut of the vine and the counter‑narrative report are decisive acts that foreclose status and safety. Pressure remains coherent and grows without gimmickry. Consequences are not enumerated exhaustively but are felt and reconfigure his future.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve a spark before dissolution) is clear and time‑pressured by the soul’s fray. Tension tightens when she isolates the single “true note” and must commit to the infuse. However, pressure remains largely unopposed and success is smooth, with no reversal or exigent trade‑off on the page. The cost lands conceptually rather than through a tested risk.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: the Heart‑Bloom’s dimming and what it means for Elara’s search. Escalation is gentle but real—observation gives way to intervention, foreclosing the old stance. The visible price is modest, centered on violating custom; still, the choice narrows her options. No antagonist, but agency drives the turn cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early: whether to proceed with “righteous” ruin or accept doubt’s shield. Pressure tightens via the brass clang (conviction) versus shells (others’ whispers), the mirror shard confrontation, and the physical unhooking that forecloses a path. The cost is felt, though external consequences remain implied rather than dramatized. The escalation is coherent and agency-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (learn to “appear”) tightens via the trance: impatience → frustration → ripple reversal → renunciation insight. Agency is attention and letting go; the narrowing is a credible deepening rather than a reversal for its own sake. The cost is internal but present, tied to the anchor of his sister. A touch more friction after the insight would heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (guide a wandering pulse; prove a form of navigation), and pressure tightens through the discovery and the flock’s chaotic scatter. The key deepening—seeing the hunter’s regret—reweights the task. Yet resistance is mild and there’s little jeopardy or sacrifice beyond attention and restraint. The resolution is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (recovering the sacred beyond automation) cohere and tighten as tools fail, pushing a real trade‑off: institutional craft vs. intuitive contact. The decisive tightening is the unstrapping—foreclosing a sanctioned path to risk a vulnerable one. Cost reads in the relinquishment and isolation. Tension is quiet but present at sentence, beat, and story scales.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake—keeping the vow—and escalates through a decisive deepening: surrendering sight to pursue listening in utter darkness. The cost is a relinquishing of the safer, “factual” posture for vulnerable devotion, with time/pressure as ambient constraints. No antagonist, but the internal conflict between physics and grief credibly tightens. Slight softness in overt risk prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—risking destruction of sensors/true isolation for a contested signal—is established and tightened by the all-in recalibration. The hours of aggressive static and near-abort escalate pressure; the pattern break reverses expectation without feeling lucky, since it follows his commitment. The final stance crystallization (curator over prophet) is a credible resolution. The price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the ceiling just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—giving form to grief—tightens under the dusk deadline and the escalating pressure of the crystallization. The primary turn is protagonist‑driven: choosing to anchor an echo rather than sever a soul. The cost (accepting an unhealed scar) is explicit and informs the Earned Stasis. Slightly soft on overt reversals, but the pressure deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—waking the world—and escalates via the realization about silence between drips, narrowing options to a precise, costly attempt. The price is exhaustion and the acceptance of a small victory against vast absence. The conflict is primarily internal/technical but converts cleanly into an external effect. No antagonist is needed; the tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—repairing collective memory—tightens as Elias moves from discovery to public accountability. The ledger correction is a clear, costly choice, trading filial comfort for civic integrity. However, opposition remains largely abstract; no on‑page pushback or obstacle tests his resolve beyond interior calculus. Still, the escalation is coherent and ends with a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (achieving the synthesis) is clear from the outset, with a meaningful tightening when he abandons analysis to attend to starlings. Escalation is accumulative: tension concentrates around the choice to warm the crystal, creating a specific, irreversible moment. The price—a surrender of control and the identity built on pure reason—registers but remains gentle. No antagonist is needed; internal pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and concentrated: avert panic while protecting colonies by retuning the network. Escalation tightens credibly from pattern anomaly to high-risk calibration with a live failure mode (shattering the only hope). The tremor creates the key narrowing, and the buckle solution is earned. The price is mostly internal; a secondary concrete loss (e.g., lasting sensor blind spot) could have heightened felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early (custody of the duplicate and Kael’s quest to feel) and pressure coheres around Jin’s attempt to stop him. Escalation arrives as Kael commits to the paradox method, risking self-drain to achieve creation. The act forecloses the option of returning the jar and reconfigures the relationship with Jin. Cost is present in the drain and the burden of responsibility that replaces numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (whether to accept a long, uncertain invitation to creation), and escalation tightens from forensic to symbolic to ritual. The cost remains mostly implied; we don’t see competing obligations or a real trade‑off tested on the page beyond time/patience. No antagonist or sharp reversal, but the one meaningful turn (choosing to plant) reads. A touch more friction or visible price would heighten the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightened by constraint: he can’t touch or speak, only roar and layer a lullaby under it. Escalation is cleanly staged via the three pulls and the amplified corridor, culminating in the wife’s approach and recognition. The price is primarily internal and situational, but pressure coheres and grows to a meaningful cadence shift. No soft resets or coincidence resolutions undercut it.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are legible early (duty vs. home) and tighten decisively when the portal becomes a “wound” demanding a stance. The escalation is coherent and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses a high‑value path. Cost is unmistakable: he suppresses the vision of home and accepts continued ache. The pressure is protagonist‑driven at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—interrupting a stifling destiny—tightens through failures to the high‑cost choice of relinquishment. The meaningful turn is the “penny drops” shift from command to surrender, which forecloses continued destruction-by‑force and risks total loss. Internal and external conflicts braid cleanly without spectacle. Price is visible: the relic’s final dissolution and the abandonment of his old tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (capturing the “shard of hush”) is signaled and pressure escalates as she opens every channel and the system threatens to fail. The decisive tightening is the inversion to seek a structured null, which reweights options. The price feels modest—no tool failure or loss forces a trade‑off—so the climax leans elegant rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: repair the seam or remain unmoored. Pressure coheres through a single tightening (from distress call to composed signal) with a clean agency pivot. Escalation is largely smooth; no significant setback or tradeoff beyond endurance and isolation. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than physical, but it registers at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—codify connection—tightens when the mother’s memory shifts and the pattern grows “more dangerous.” The escalation is coherent and driven by his agency (he incorporates the coldness and ties the final knot), and the price is unmistakable at the end. While pressure rises convincingly, a single additional tactical adjustment under strain could have sharpened the narrowing of options. Still, the decisive intensification before the eruption satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—convince a risk‑averse polity to chart the “new ocean”—is clear and tightens from private obsession to public argument. The meaningful tightening is the move from discovery to presentation; opposition is present but not dramatized into direct confrontation. Cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, which tempers intensity. Still, agency drives the deepening and the ending holds pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around locating the right recipient and translating urgency into assurance. Escalation is a cadence shift—frantic to steady—rather than obstacle-driven; it’s apt for the lens but keeps the price small. Elias’s agency is clear in initiating and delivering the assurance that changes the outcome. A harder trade-off or risk would have lifted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible: free the trapped consciousnesses despite the tide and claustrophobia. The blocked corridor is a true tightening that forecloses a path and demands a costly adaptation (phasing through rock). Resolution is earned by his choice to complete the system and accept their absence. Stakes could press harder mid‑scene with a tangible time loss or additional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early (contact/defragment to glean wisdom), with a meaningful deepening when the ink finally coheres. Escalation is accumulative/textural—hours of failure then a distinct break—rather than adversarial. Price reads as stamina/attention and an existential tilt rather than a concrete loss. Earned and coherent, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—extract a true word from the hurricane of echoes—is signaled early and tightens when the flock forms the creation spiral, forcing immediate alignment. The reversal (ceaseless noise to absolute silence to single tone) is clean and earned. Pressure is primarily conceptual and sensory rather than peril-based, with limited explicit price paid. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes clarify early (expose the “monster” vs. understand/accept) and tighten decisively at the moment he holds the tools of metamorphosis. The witnessed transformation raises cost and narrows options; his refusal is a true foreclosure, not a pause. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence. A single, well‑placed deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates when the Wardens switch from patrol to charge, narrowing options and forcing her to pour “more of herself” into the music. The tightening is clear and the cost (risk and exhaustion) shows on the page. While compelling, the price remains mostly physical and immediate, with limited lingering consequence. Still, the reversal from control to reclamation is earned by her method and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible and tight: ferry a consciousness across a hostile net. Escalation arrives via the live clock and a manufactured void; the return of the drones’ hum narrows the window and raises tension. Agency drives every turn (uncorking, jacking in, recorking), with the price mostly in exposure risk and one‑shot resource burn. A slightly deeper on‑page consequence would elevate the cost, but the pressure reads.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he transform static hush into living quiet—tightens as he commits to crowning the mare and accepts the risk of breaking his long silence. The wind’s surge escalates pressure into a single decisive intensification; his agency drives the turn. The price is felt: surrendering the protective stillness he has curated for a decade. It’s a subtle arc, but the cadence shift reads unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—piercing the “place where stories live”—is clear and tightens through one decisive intensification (the window opens, pulses the room, then shuts). Agency drives the turn; the elderly patron’s flicker underscores risk and boundary. Cost is modest but present: he fails to capture, pays in restraint, and re‑embraces waiting. The pressure arc is coherent if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering the runaway dream) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the prismatic fog appears. Escalation is mostly density/pattern-based rather than adversarial, fitting the lens. The pressure feels serene rather than perilous, so cost and narrowing of options are mild. Still, the final act requires a committed, irreversible release of the collected light.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: liberate a trapped composition. Escalation occurs via a tight clock (first star) and a tactical deepening (disorient fear through pattern rather than forcing a key). The price is the release into the solar winds rather than a personal reclamation. It’s a graceful tightening rather than a reversal, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates coherently: anomaly intensifies pressure, forcing a trade-off between method and need. The decisive action (touching the mushroom) is protagonist-driven, with a visible price (rule breach, ache, and a future of work rather than instant relief). Cadence tightens effectively without excess reversals. A small added complication (risk to the mushroom or tool) could have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—escape versus resilience—tightens via the tea geometry, the cube’s warning, and the requirement to “forget the face of your mother.” Pressure grows through Kael’s agitation and the explicit risks of returning too soon. The reversal is quiet but real: she rejects the map’s implied urgency and pays with delay and loss. Internal and external conflict interlace effectively at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared early (“preserve the color of wonder”), and the meaningful tightening is the choice to treat a spiritual ailment with essence, not water. Yet there’s no resistance, setback, or trade‑off; success is immediate once the method is invoked. Pressure grows by density, not narrowing options, and the price of the act remains abstract. The result is lovely but low‑tension escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—grounding unrest before it unravels creation—is translated into a concrete test: one sailor’s knot. Escalation arrives as density and focus rather than reversals, culminating in the precise, risky untying; cost surfaces as physical/psychic depletion and the scale of remaining work. Stakes skirt abstraction early but get localized credibly in the release beat. The final handoff sustains pressure by foreclosing respite.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose or preserve the hidden chamber—tightens via the lichen seam discovery. Agency surfaces in the choice to “reopen” by interpretation rather than by force, which narrows future options with a principled refusal. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens. The price of restraint is implied rather than sharply dramatized, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding/letting go) tightens as knowledge deepens; the note reweights options, culminating in the refusal to extract the globe. The cost is quiet but legible; the choice forecloses a tempting path. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, appropriate for the lens, but the on‑page pressure remains contemplative rather than acute. Still, the cadence shift at the note and the final renunciation are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (reach Lyra before the window closes) tightens as static builds and thunder approaches, with a small reversal (moment of nothing, then the reply). Agency is clear: he chooses symbols culminating in the bolt-plate glyph under clock pressure. Cost is present but gentle—the connection is temporary, consciousness decays. Strong escalation for a quiet piece, though not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres under a quiet, internal stake: to uncover a hidden joy without violating the dead captain’s dignity. Escalation is a steady tightening—the chimes, the decoding, the concealed vellum—and culminates in a discovery that forces a stance. The cost is the self‑imposed burden and the renunciation of disclosure, which reweights his promotion. It’s strong but remains gentle, with minimal friction beyond conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—achieving proof/memorial—tightens via the search culminating in the fractal signature. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through direct jeopardy; the noctilucent “quietly explosive” image functions as the decisive intensification. Cost is understated; little is foreclosed beyond the quiet acceptance that the task ends. Still, the deepening reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finish the guild’s task before demolition—tightens through time pressure and the intricate lock sequence. The meaningful deepening is the successful opening and the instruction to press stone to the heartwood, which reweights options and urgency. The felt price is the imminent loss of the sanctuary, though a sharper on-page trade-off (e.g., risk to her life) would heighten escalation. Tension scales cleanly without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—locate and chart the luminance—is signaled early and tightened by the fading light and initial failure. The hopscotch discovery and starling translation are meaningful deepening beats under the Causal lens. Still, cost is gentle and largely unstated; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond prior time and solitude already paid. The resolution is earned by attention and synthesis rather than a pressured trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure coheres around the hostile glare and the hall’s failure-echoes, tightening when the vial’s seal breaks and options narrow to a single shot. Stakes remain personal but palpable: restore the frozen heart or remain trapped in stasis. Escalation is primarily one decisive intensification rather than a series of tests, and success comes swiftly once the keyhole appears. The implied cost of spending the eclipse essence helps charge the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (escape through a chaotic magnetosphere) is clear, with a meaningful tightening via the eclipse window and the “impossible” ascent. Agency drives turns (choosing to trust the messages; rigging, hoisting, striking). Costs are tangible in effort and risk, though internal moral calculus is relatively light. The escalation coheres under a causal lens without coincidence solving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—imprinting peace at the cost of self—arrives early and tightens when the final ripple hits and his essence drains. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals, fitting the lens; the cost is unmistakable at the end. Agency is endurance and renunciation, credibly foreclosing life. A small beat of jeopardized failure could have heightened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is established early and coherently tightened by the approaching frost and the birds’ patterning. The meaningful turn occurs at activation: birds falter, path appears, with the cost immediately following (spent nut). Pressure remains situationally consistent; one more on‑page complication mid‑assembly could have sharpened the squeeze. Still, the price paid at the end is unmistakable and alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can he reconfigure his stance toward Lena—tightens through the foam’s pattern recognition, turning perception into altered option (a letter that celebrates, not apologizes). The cost is internal: relinquishing a rigid design for her life. Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative lens. No external pressure, but the internal pressure deepens convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via density shifts: mapping voids → locating the absolute tree → deciding to wound it. The tightening works, but opposition is internal and gentle; no counterforce tests him beyond the conceptual taboo of scarring perfection. The visible price is the loss of pristine purity. Strong deepening, modest pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether Kaelen will remain a buffer or become a conduit; escalation peaks when he opens himself fully to the motes. The cost is unmistakable and alters options; the pavilion’s collapse forecloses retreat. The path is straightforward but not simplistic, with internal and external stakes interwoven. One clean tightening beats the length well.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (rehabilitate the network before fracture), and escalation is legible as the cacophony fights back and the armature trembles violently. The tightening centers on a single, decisive calibration with a small but present risk. Agency resolves the conflict; coincidence doesn’t intrude. The on‑page price is primarily exertional/empathic rather than a sharper trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving a dream at risk to self—tightens when the “entangled memories” fight back and the system strains. The escalation is internal but credible, culminating in a stabilization that could have broken her. A visible price is present (risk, pain), though consequences beyond the moment are not deeply etched. Agency drives the turn: she chooses, focuses, and endures rather than being saved by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: secure the hidden synthesis before gravity returns. Pressure tightens through the perspective key at the obsidian wall and the time limit as pebbles begin to “stir,” culminating in a risky exit. Agency drives each turn, and the escape has consequences, though the price paid is more anticipatory than scarring. A sharper on-page sacrifice would elevate the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates through density and orchestration rather than opposition, appropriate for the selected lens. The key turn is methodological: from imposing melody to releasing the grove’s stored tension, enabling the symphonic moment. Stakes remain intimate but clear; cost is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than materially foreclosing options. A touch more resistance or risk would heighten the tightening, but the accumulative deepening still reads.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—wresting pattern/beauty from chaos—is signaled and tightened by the approaching “next phase.” Escalation is a density increase rather than adversarial conflict, but the cadence shift at the alignment is decisive. The on‑page price is subtle (renunciation of the past via the stone), not visceral, which keeps tension refined rather than gripping. Still, the deepening reweights options and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture a specific silence before the fireworks break it. Pressure escalates via wrong frequencies, ticking clock, and the intuitive leap past increments, narrowing options toward risk. The price is subtle (foregoing words, trusting feeling under time), fitting an accumulative piece. Stakes remain intimate rather than sharp-edged, keeping it just shy of higher intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early; escalation arrives with the wind’s assault that intensifies cost and narrows options. Her agency is endurance/attention, and the decision to hold the seed’s scent forecloses the easier path (shutting down/fleeing). The price—physical pain and near‑overwhelm—is legible. A single, coherent tightening suffices and resolves credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (secure planetary resilience) is clear, with pressure cohering around the one‑hour inversion and the narrowing path through the geode. Escalation is credible (river entry, mounting hum, crystal center, gravity’s return), and the extraction beat forces a time‑bound decision. The visible price is mainly risk and potential damage to the source, not a tradeoff that bites on the page. Still, the tightening cadence reads earned and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (solve the silence) tightens meaningfully when the patch forces a skyward pivot, narrowing options and accelerating toward the epicenter. The escalation is knowledge‑driven rather than combative, appropriate for the lens, and the cost (hollow victory) is legible. Pressure remains coherent though largely unopposed; it’s a cerebral ratchet rather than a contest. Effective within length, if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—undo the manufactured hush—and escalation is handled through intensifying sensory density as the song swells. The key tightening is the moment the hush “dissolved,” moving from pressure to transformation. Yet resistance is externalized and offers little friction; Kael faces no on-page cost or credible risk. The pressure is cohesive but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is internal comprehension, tightened by a single decisive tactic shift (play a question, not a ward). Pressure coheres through the hush → shimmer → insight sequence, with a visible price (pain, acceptance of prior misreading). Stakes remain intimate but never abstract. No antagonist needed; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: Anya seeks alteration of grief; Elias seeks comprehension/data. Pressure coheres and tightens with the lever pull and the room’s transformation; the price is that pain remains, reframed. Agency skews to Elias, with Anya mostly enduring, but the escalation still reads earned under the chosen lens. One decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around an internal stake—fear vs. wonder—escalated by the aurora’s break and the pendant’s activation. The tightening is a single decisive intensification that changes knowledge rather than forcing a difficult trade. The price (relinquishing the “routine” safety and accepting the mythic unknown) is felt but remains largely conceptual. Slight external stakes (being followed) are raised then not tested, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (what truth will the world yield: love vs. mechanism) is signaled early and tightens toward dawn. His agency builds and triggers the test; the reversal (schematic not sentiment) carries a visible emotional price. Pressure is coherent and escalates through a single decisive intensification rather than multiple turns, fitting the length. Slightly low friction mid-scene—success feels inevitable once conditions align.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (send message vs. self‑erasure) is legible from the outset and tightens at “recommence” and the “locking threads.” The decisive act forecloses a path: she cannot remember the beloved, even as the message departs. Cost is unmistakable in the name’s void and the clean, contextless longing at the end. Quiet pressure escalates credibly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible from the start and tightens at the barter: the price of revival will be personal memory. The escalation is primarily internal-to-ritual, with one meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns. Cost is unmistakable, though external opposition is minimal. The earned result reframes options (he will return diminished yet resolute).

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (truth and preventing further bleed‑through), and pressure coheres as the “tide” rises toward the peak. The decisive turn—redirecting the energy into uninhabited realities—forecloses a path and exacts a cost (loss of access to Elara’s echoes). Escalation is mostly conceptual rather than combative, fitting the lens, but the solution unfolds with minimal resistance on the page. A beat of friction or price paid in the act would strengthen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are singular and legible: safeguard the light (and by extension the fragile bond). Pressure escalates coherently from the blackout to the storm crossing to the mechanical repair, with the discovery of the keeper’s departure deepening the cost. Resolution stems from Silas’s agency and culminates in a renunciation (the circle/farewell). The only slight limitation is that physical hazard resolves swiftly, but it remains sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (shape the storm/dawn) is signaled early; escalation tracks via density: the storm swells, beam sculpts, wick nears failure. The tightening shows in the white‑hot strain and tower shudder, with his stamina as a visible price. Conflict remains primarily situational and procedural rather than morally compounded. Still, resolution is earned by his sustained agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (to understand the woman) is clear and escalates through disciplined observation to the risk of direct engagement. The meaningful tightening is his approach with the wing and articulation of the refractive thesis; this narrows the ambiguity and tests his hypothesis. The price is modest—exposure and potential rejection—so the tension remains lyrical rather than acute. Still, the cadence shift at the conversation is earned and reweights the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding and properly housing the shard’s sorrow) tightens through the precise sound and the unprecedented sorrow‑meter spike. The storm peak and sudden moonshaft provide a single decisive intensification that changes options. Cost is mostly conceptual and quiet; there’s little foreclosed path beyond his acceptance of archivist over savior. Still, escalation is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are early and dominant: without a dawn, the tree and realm die. Escalation arrives via accumulation—fragments gathered through care, then the ritual and the final “swaddling” choice—producing one clear tightening. The price is more atmospheric than punishing, and there’s little threat of failure once the song is complete. Still, the narrowing to the delicate, no‑touch solution feels like a genuine test.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (understanding his refusal and finding a survivable mode of connection) are clear and tighten when Elara arrives, forcing a tactic (“staying while leaving”) that leads to a knowledge shift. The primary turn is internal but consequential, and the invitation’s treatment provides visible action tied to cost. Pressure is coherent though quiet; the price is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the escalation reads as a decisive deepening rather than static mood.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (risk of censure vs. preserving memory/life) is clear early and tightens with the patrolman’s arrival. Elara’s choice to uncloak and offer the bread raises cost and narrows options; his memory line turns the beat. Resolution is an earned endurance with altered social terrain. Stakes remain intimate but felt, appropriate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the vow’s frequency before it dies—is signaled early and tightens as the projection frays and the light pulses like a “failing heartbeat.” Agency drives the escalation (tuning, searching for the carrier wave, decisive capture). The last flare and single tone provide a clear pinch and price. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than physical, but it’s legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (“burn their whole fragile ecosystem down” by sunrise) and escalates through a series of false starts. The meaningful tightening arrives when she abandons bids and appeals to authority and chooses deception that targets Eva’s mistrust. Prices are present (moral compromise, social risk to Elara, Silas’s loss of standing), though not deeply lingered on. Tension is coherent and sentence‑level pressure supports the peak exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates convincingly as multiple carriers arrive, weather fields merge, and the aurora tightens. The dominant stake (proof via emergent compass) deepens through sensory escalation and the celestial “intervention.” Agency is light—Elara doesn’t take a decisive act at the peak—so the cost feels more contemplative than hard‑priced. Still, the tightening reweights knowledge and options effectively under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around rectifying the failed lock and unlocking a truer practice. The tightening is the shift from brute force (past) to precision (present), with the tactile safecracking as the concrete test. Stakes are primarily internal but legible; the cost is implied more than dramatized, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recover authenticity) is legible, and pressure coheres through the map’s deepening to vault discovery. Escalation is exploratory rather than adversarial; options narrow via the plate/key beat. The final act (planting) reflects agency but the immediate price remains implied, keeping the tension moderate. A credible tightening, not a severe trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: release the fading truth at the right moment despite the price. Escalation arrives as a cadence shift when the wind begins and the structure activates, culminating in the melt. Agency is chiefly craft, attention, and endurance rather than a contested decision under duress. The cost is unmistakable but the path to it is smooth, with little complication en route.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight: resolve inner static and escape the enclosure. Pressure escalates from controlled opening to overload warnings to a will‑and‑furnace contest, then to the precision breach. The price is legible: risking system failure, diverting life support, and leaving the curated safety of the garden. One decisive tightening suffices at this length and is protagonist‑driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: open 7B without violating the community’s fabric. Pressure escalates modestly via management’s drilling threat and the accumulating clues, culminating in the key discovery. The resolution is earned by Elias’s chosen method, but the price is minimal and the path largely frictionless. Still, there is a credible tightening from ambient frustration to decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (liberation) is signaled early and tightened by the realization that chance must be embraced. The meaningful turn is the surrender to randomness; it forecloses the path of pure control. Pressure escalates primarily internally; external stakes remain atmospheric rather than biting. Effective but not bracingly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early, and pressure coheres as the coffee spiral tightens into the dense core, then the resistance of thickened air. The storm‑flash success followed by immediate loss credibly raises cost and narrows options (the pocket fluctuates away). Agency drives the turn; luck doesn’t rescue him. Stakes remain personal but visceral, with a felt price in partial recovery and physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: quell an infectious, coded prophecy. Escalation reads as a widening hush network rather than reversal; it tightens once and resolves without a sharp trade‑off or loss beyond effort. The “fragile blanket” line hints at cost and future risk, but the on‑page pressure remains gentle. Effective, not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus the comfort of denial—is signaled early and tightened when Clara changes venue to force the conversation. The interrogation is an agentive move, and the cost is clear: ending the protective fiction and taking on duty. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The lack of external jeopardy limits ceiling but does not blunt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (owning traumatic memory vs. remaining “safe”) is explicit early and tightens via time pressure and the peak choice to endure the full memory. Cost is legible—he relives the searing accident—and a path is foreclosed (curated peace). Escalation is protagonist-driven, not coincidental, and culminates in a consequential act.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (undo a war‑binding oath without detection) is established early and deepens toward the precise act. The tightening is a single, focused escalation—the hover, the dot, the tail—where error would mean ruin. The price reads as risk and moral trespass rather than a loss paid on the page. Quiet, but tension sustains through the act’s irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is focused—understand echoes—and tightens as each clue demands deeper commitment, culminating in the completion act. The turn from question to answer is the key escalation, with a felt internal price rather than external jeopardy. While the pressure is more elegiac than perilous, agency drives the resolution. The cost registers, if quietly, in renouncing the search for her mother’s echo.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (freeing the lingering soul by uncovering truth) are signaled early and escalate as Elara shifts from collecting glimpses to engineering a confrontation. The key tightening is her choice to build a larger shared dream, foreclosing gentler options. The exposure line creates a sharp turn; the antagonist dissolves a touch too readily, softening the felt price. Still, agency drives the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens: desire to enter the pattern tightens into the on‑page test of the whistle. The momentary “flair” and subsequent drift give a clear beat of micro‑reversal and cost. Stakes remain intimate (ego/meaning/participation), not dramatic, but the escalation is sufficient at this length. Resolution is earned by his renunciation and reframed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of the orchard—tightens once through the alignment/intuition beat. Escalation is intellectual rather than perilous; no antagonist or ticking cost pressures the choice, and failure carries minimal on-page consequence. Agency is present and decisive at the end, but without a felt price, tension remains muted. The single deepening (realizing how to use the diamond) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (choose allegiance to define the new age) is signaled and tightens under the Great Storm and dueling voices. The pivotal escalation is the forced choice that he subverts via the map-filter insight. Agency drives resolution (he broadcasts the third way), but the price of refusing both powers feels low on the page. Storm cessation risks undercutting perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through accumulation: the discovery of the broken box intensifies the need to compose a counter‑song. The tightening occurs in the decision to reject repair and pursue a harder, more idiosyncratic ritual, culminating in the performance. Stakes remain intimate but legible—refusing to let beauty die unheard—paid off in the final acceptance. The conflict is quiet, yet the trade‑off is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and active from the outset; pressure escalates coherently to the violent frequency lock. The tactical pivot—adaptation via mirroring—narrows options and carries bodily cost. The price is palpable but could sharpen with one explicit foreclosed alternative in the peak beat. Still, the tightening is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake (unyoking the city) and tightens with the live clock of Lyra’s meridian and the rain‑altered viaduct. The ripple and thrum falter beat provide a decisive deepening; Kaelen’s restrained signal is the committed turn. Cost is mostly internalized (foregone impulse, generational waiting) rather than immediate jeopardy, but it’s felt. Escalation remains disciplined and consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes focus on professional integrity vs. expedient sign‑off, tightened by the second sensory wave and the notebook discovery. The train’s reverberation escalates pressure in a single meaningful deepening. The price is subtle (career friction) but signaled. No antagonist on the page, yet the coherent pressure forces a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: Arthur seeks a fix; Elias reframes; the storm light catalyzes a turn; Arthur renounces the fix‑it path by leaving the heart. The cost is modest yet credible—relinquishing his savior mechanism—and it narrows his future tactics. There’s one meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate for length and lens. A hair more friction or resistance in Arthur could have heightened escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates credibly: decipherment yields a risky build, the launch converts belief into a life-or-death test, and the fall tightens to a single irreversible command. The cost is legible in the physical hazard and the chosen solitude of an unheard bell. The reversal (from falling to “holding”) emerges from his agency rather than luck. A second, smaller pressure—like a failure beat pre-launch—could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: uncovering Julian’s fate/truth vs. corporate suppression. Escalation coheres via the accumulating numeric pattern and the supervisor’s intrusion, narrowing options to a lie or exposure. The final choice forecloses safety and deepens moral cost while achieving the goal. The price is more implied than felt in consequence terms, keeping it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent—community cohesion vs. scapegoating—and the tightening occurs when Kael leaves confrontation to seek proof. Escalation is modest and resolves quickly once the visions clarify events; there’s little resistance or risk to his method. The price is primarily Mara’s exposed grief and collective vulnerability rather than a hard trade‑off. Effective, but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (comprehension of endings) is clear, and pressure coheres as the ice’s sound gathers from groan to “sighing crackle.” The tightening is an internal agency choice—attentive endurance—culminating in stance crystallization. The price is ethical complicity and the foreclosed need to keep searching. Slight softness in overt on‑page cost prevents a higher score, but escalation reads clean under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal (can he reinterpret the past without erasing its pain), signaled early and tightened through the Mourvedre/Grenache analogy and the fire memory. The deepening realization narrows options: from clinging to fault to accepting chemistry and cost. The price is felt—foreclosing the heat-driven love he valorized. Quiet escalation fits the lens, though external pressure remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early, and escalation tightens through the descent and the “critical moment” of consecration. Pressure grows under the accumulative lens, but opposing force is mainly conceptual, with minimal on‑page resistance. The cost is a trade‑off—leaving the debate to secure purity—rather than a contested loss. Still, the consecration beat credibly narrows options and finalizes the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accrues via pattern density rather than clash; the decisive tightening is the final piece completing the spiral. Stakes—transforming communal pain—remain abstractly scaled but are made legible through photograph pairings. The cost and narrowing of options are felt lightly; tension is more meditative than fraught. Still, the cadence shift at completion is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure deepens through density: from a fall and faint hum to weeks of listening that reconfigure the dominant stake. The decisive tightening is his choice not to write, which forecloses a lifetime path. External opposition is minimal; tension is quiet and internal, which slightly softens escalation. Nonetheless, the trade‑off (publish vs testify) is clear and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around the need to locate the nexus and recall the sigil; escalation is clear in the hum rising and markers becoming “more desperate.” The narrowing option (lost memory) forces a trade—capture vs. presence—with a felt price. The turn at the altar is protagonist-driven, not coincidental. Stakes remain internal but are viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (save the station at a personal/temporal price) is clear early, with a clean tightening from hum to crescendo to the crack. Elias rejects the easy “dampen” path and chooses a costlier restructure that narrows options to a single precise action. The sacrifice forecloses future time, an unmistakable price. Tension operates at line and beat scales without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular—achieve a flawless goodbye before death—and the pressure coheres via the ticking biological clock and estrangement risk. Escalation is quiet but real: the decisive call to a resistant Lena, the ritualized staging, then the meeting and shared listening. Costs are understated yet legible: pride and time surrendered, the acceptance that the music will be their last measure together. The conflict resolves without reversal fireworks, but the deepening is sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—solve the noon‑shadow paradox—is signaled early and tightened through the key’s paradoxical alignment and the non‑intuitive push. Pressure grows coherently but stays low‑temperature; risk and visible price are understated. Still, agency drives the outcome, and the knowledge gained narrows uncertainty. The escalation is a single decisive deepening rather than a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is internal: surrender or defend certainty. Pressure escalates credibly from unease in the garden to the tangible tooth and culminates in a new act of mapping that forecloses his prior stance. The price—lifelong self‑forgiveness work and a reconfigured worldview—is unmistakable. Slightly quiet on external resistance, but the internal conflict tightens enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—craft a clean, constant light—tightens as the shard shifts from refuse to artifact and the single sliver of light tests the work. Escalation is quiet but legible: repetition and patience intensify, then the beam forces a real outcome. The price is mostly endurance and the renunciation of fire; no reversal beyond the momentary pause to weigh, but for this length it suffices. Agency drives the resolution rather than coincidence, despite the timed light.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (can he reframe his public failure and accept care) is legible early and tightens when she reframes fossil vs melt and physically offers the pendant. Escalation is quiet but real: observation → pattern recognition → intimate risk. The price—surrendering her own protective symbol and possibly being rebuffed—reads on the page. Slightly modest pressure band keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake—reconciling with forsaken stories—tightens as the current escalates from pressure to gale and the cameos amass into a crowd. The burial is a renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing the path of possessive authorship. The pressure is coherent without needing an antagonist; the tightening is decisive at the clearing. Stakes stay internal but are felt through concrete resistance and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving practices as remedy—tightens under a live clock and performance precision. Escalation is achieved by density: hum to chant, dissonance corrected, visions bloom, then dissolve with dawn. The pressure feels coherent, though opposition is mostly environmental and technical rather than antagonistic. Cost is gentler than searing, but the passing window and assumed burden register.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres as a lyric deepening: patience against global urgency, finite starlight, and a binding act that steadies a panicked heartbeat. The key tightening is the thumb‑seal transforming frantic pulse to a “steady, reassuring beacon,” foreclosing inaction. Stakes stay focused (get a map to a child now) and resolve via his deliberate ritual. Conflict is largely internal/processual, but the cost and narrowing of options are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: revive the mechanism to harvest echoes. Pressure escalates texturally as the sun’s path is charted and understanding crystallizes, culminating in the rebuild and test. The price paid (weeks of focused solitude, painstaking iteration) is present but not sharply dramatized in a pinch point. A single meaningful deepening occurs; harsher trade-off or risk would raise tension.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (transmute grief into peace) is signaled early; pressure coheres via the intense, exacting alignment ritual. The hum and slowing pulse mark the meaningful tightening, with the cost resting in the warden‑like endurance. Escalation remains quiet, more procedural than contested, and avoids a hard trade‑off. Still, the charged final placement registers consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—contain grief by extracting a lesson—tightens under a single meaningful cadence shift at the whistle. The cost is an acceptance of endurance and precision over emotional release. Escalation is subtle but legible under the accumulative lens: noise crescendos to the decisive cut and then the earned quiet. Not a high‑conflict piece, but pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for length.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (acceptance vs. self‑absolution) is clear early, with pressure cohering around the “audio‑sieve” work. The discovery of the camera wheel meaningfully deepens the conflict by collapsing then/now and stripping away denial. The resolution is a self‑imposed cost that narrows future options (no more bargaining). Tension is mostly internal but escalates cleanly to the spoken confession.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether she can animate the terminal’s buried intent—tightens as she commits to a risky, jerry‑rigged reroute. The “nothing happens” beat creates a small but real turn before the thrum and starfield. Still, external pressure and concrete prices (time, danger, consequences) are understated, so escalation feels measured rather than acute. Agency drives the turn, but the felt cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is internal yet coherent: the need to bear witness rather than destroy tightens as he unclasps the coffer and arranges the bells. The single meaningful deepening occurs with the sunrise’s intervention, reweighting the act. Stakes remain focused on renunciation with a felt price; no external antagonist is needed. The escalation is gentle but unmistakable for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (salvage truth before the broadcast day) is clear and coheres under a Causal lens. Pressure tightens through the physical salvage and the clock, culminating in knowledge that narrows future options (reframing the family’s narrative). The cost is conceptual rather than peril‑based, but it registers. A slightly sharper mid‑scene setback could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (decoding/preserving) is clear, with escalation through the fog’s enveloping and the shift from “knot” to “sequence.” Pressure is largely internal and gentle; options don’t visibly narrow beyond patience and method, and the price is endurance rather than consequence. The deepening is sufficient for this mode but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: composing Elara’s “explained absence.” Escalation occurs via intensification of sensory and emotional density in the projection, culminating in a charged stance. The price is conceptual (keeping pain within the mapped place) and felt (deeper chill, solitude). There’s no sharp reversal, but the deepening is sufficient for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and pressure coheres: sustained assembly and sleepless vigilance accumulate toward the hatch. The meaningful tightening arrives with the crack from within, forcing acceptance of a non‑ideal outcome. Cost is visible (bodily depletion, relinquishing a purist resurrection). Slightly more explicit tradeoff or resisted option at the peak would sharpen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save what’s left of the banyan as an act of self-redemption—is legible early and deepens under pressure. The meaningful tightening is the choice to break the talisman thread and bind the graft, paying a real price. External opposition is largely subdued post-blaze, so moment-to-moment hazard is modest; still, the internal/external weave holds. A small added obstacle on scene might have intensified the narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single ticking window and a precision task that admits only one correct alignment. The meaningful tightening arrives at the rotation and momentary resolution of the light into a sigil; the click and whisper pay it off. Stakes are conceptually scaled (memories, relief) rather than personally perilous, which keeps the price subtle. Agency drives the turn without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight; pressure coheres through discovery and the heretic’s failure. The meaningful tightening is the null-beacon and gear’s logic forcing a tactic shift from calculating routes to emitting feeling. Price is implicit (abandoning a tradition/tools and committing to ongoing giving). Escalation is restrained but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and deepens through the iterative retracing; the escalation spikes with the storm and the convergence “nexus” moment. Agency manifests as endurance and a precise, culminating cut that reconfigures meaning. The price is a chosen departure from individual memorialization toward communal abstraction. Tension is quiet but coherent, operating through density rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around the finite pause and the internal demand to release vs. contain. The meaningful tightening is the apex: once the pendulum drops, the option forecloses. Cost is felt as disciplined renunciation and ongoing burden rather than external loss. Slight softness remains because the “letting go” is envisioned, not materially executed.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes focus on decoding intention; escalation occurs via concentrated, tactile work and the discovery of the “frayed silver thread,” followed by the case’s pulse. Pressure remains inward and aesthetic, not adversarial, but there is a clear deepening and reveal. The resolution comes from Elias’s agency; however, on-page cost is muted. The tightening is sufficient for this length but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (stagnation vs. transformational risk) is established early and tightens to a single, consequential act. The cost—imposing hardship, condemning traditions—is explicit and felt. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent and mounting via model pruning toward the narrowing tributary. A slightly more concrete external pressure in-scene could have intensified turn severity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (smuggling memory into sanctioned music) is legible and coherent. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal: the broadcast arrives, he works, then the reveal intensifies meaning. The felt price is implied (risk of illegality) rather than enacted, limiting pressure. Still, the ritualized acts narrow options toward endurance and secrecy credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are tight and singular: to crystallize a moment against overwhelming grief. Pressure deepens via the live clock of the rocking chair, narrowing the exact moment of release. While conflict is inward and ritualized rather than adversarial, the cadence shift at the stop constitutes a clear tightening with cost. Slight softness remains in on‑page resistance or jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve knowledge vs convert the living—is clear early and tightens sharply with the child’s superstition. The exchange forecloses a path (teaching) and sets the price (continued solitude and marginalization), earning the final renunciation. Tension is primarily internal but activated by external pressure, avoiding static brooding. Stakes are intimate but consequential, scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are focused early: can he forge harmony from inherited animosity. Escalation tightens via the deliberate subtraction tactic—no lyrics, only breath, then a single note—narrowing options with a measured price (yielding pride, surrendering individual show). The pressure arc is more deepening than reversing, consistent with the lens. The cost is subtle and could sharpen with one concrete friction point resisted then released on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reweighting cultural memory) is clear and escalates under a ticking clock and the plant’s chaotic surge. The pruning sequence provides the meaningful tightening; tasting each cut tests resolve. The price is more conceptual than visceral, so pressure reads as steady rather than harrowing. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and the ending is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on truth versus sterile efficiency; pressure coheres but remains gentle. The tightening beat is Lena deciphering the riddle and the admission “No,” reconfiguring the crisis. Escalation is intellectual/emotional rather than choice‑constraining, and no hard trade‑off is paid on the page. The result is elegant but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—pushing back against creeping sterility—is signaled early and tightens at the “source” house. The escalation is a single, meaningful intensification (placing the orris shard) followed by a reweighted aftermath. Prices are mostly conceptual; on-page jeopardy is mild, keeping tension elegant but low-simmer. Resolution arises from Elara’s reframed agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake is legible early (destroy vs. protect the city), and pressure tightens as the “weakness” is revealed to be vital infrastructure. The key turn is Mara’s agency in refusing the mission and burying the ampoule with visible foreclosing of options. Moral calculus is sharpened by the poison’s scope (toxic to all life here). Slightly limited by minimal external counterpressure or time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear early (touching the illogical at personal risk) and escalate toward the single high‑pressure roll. The rupture exacts a felt price and narrows options (he gets the moment’s pain, not escape). Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. Could sharpen the pre‑roll tension with one additional costed trade‑off, but current pressure suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is crisp: can he rouse the sleeping city’s memory of kindness. Escalation tightens through the act of switching on lights, the vast silence, the growing ache of doubt. The reversal (first answering window) is earned and redefines options. Cost remains mostly emotional/existential but is clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (survival beneath the ice) is established early and tightens as the fractures are revealed. The escalation from council doubt to a city‑wide, risk‑bearing song is protagonist‑driven and culminates in a felt environmental response. The price is mostly contingent (the danger they invoke) and morale‑based, which slightly softens the edge. Still, the turn to “We can persuade it” convincingly narrows options into a singular, communal tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberation versus erasure—is clear and escalates as tide reaches nadir and the mechanism clicks into readiness. The decisive tightening is the irreversible lever pull that forecloses retreat. Cost signals are on-page (physical and existential unspooling), though antagonistic pressure is largely internal. Tension operates at the sentence and scene level without bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is coherent: survive and outmaneuver Fear by turning brokenness into leverage. Pressure escalates from eerie ingress to a direct mirror confrontation and the risky unbosoming. The tightening choice (confessing the void) narrows options and springs the trap. If anything, victory comes slightly swiftly, but the on‑page cost and narrowing still read earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (protect the floating orchard) is clear, and escalation arrives with the Razor Squall’s peak. The meaningful tightening is the moment he times the strikes to the waves, narrowing options to precision and endurance. Resolution is earned by his tactic rather than luck. Only the price signal is light; the piece could benefit from one sharper cost or near‑failure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear early (understanding/contact) and deepen into existential consequence (doomed trajectory). Escalation is protagonist-driven; his performed sequence triggers the reversal and maps their extinction. The cost is legible in both the cracked tool and the new, impossible social task he shoulders. While the conflict is primarily knowledge-driven, tension scales at sentence and scene levels without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—surrender the letter to expose the founding lie—is clear from the outset. Pressure coheres and tightens through Aris’s historical precedent, culminating in Elara’s choice with visible personal cost. The escalation is intellectual rather than kinetic but remains tense and focused. A slight on‑page hint of what she loses socially would heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve the vessel of memory and seal the note—tightens when the rogue current upends control. The decisive beat (diving, finding brass by touch) narrows options and extracts a physical price. Resolution earnestly stems from his agency, not coincidence. While intimate rather than high‑stakes, pressure scales convincingly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates quietly but coherently: the blackout compels new methods; the stamp discovery tightens to a single ethical choice. Stakes remain personal yet substantive (truth vs. sanctioned history), and the refusal to announce forecloses a path. The cost is subdued rather than acute, keeping tension elegant but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving grief a bearable form—tightens as he climbs under memory pressure and chooses to polish the gem to alter the outcome. The decisive deepening occurs when the basilica projects the dream, forcing him to confront a beautiful, broken future and shift stance. Cost is emotional but unmistakable, and the final crane fold forecloses denial. Escalation is more inward than outward yet coherent and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates under the ticking-clock constraint, culminating in the breaker reset that threatens data loss. The core stake—pin down the reservoir before the window closes—tightens options and changes knowledge at the end. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than a concrete trade-off, but it’s felt and reweights future tactics. A single additional impediment or sacrificed option could have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens as the schematic forces a precise path culminating in the physically costly pull. Stakes remain personal and focused on belonging; escalation is clear but gentle. One solid turn (the hidden seam/handle) narrows options effectively. The price paid is mostly exertion, limiting the bite of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early; pressure coheres as the search intensifies into the gouged oak beat. The meaningful tightening is the discovery that silence was engineered, foreclosing the option of simple mourning and forcing a new, costlier path. Resolution arises from his agency to repurpose his talent. Mostly internalized pressure keeps it a notch below peak.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—two fragile lives and institutional trust—is clear and tightened by the ritual steps culminating in the lock’s rasp. The mutual key‑taking and simultaneous uncuffing sharpen the risk calculus without theatrics. Cost is the deliberate exposure to betrayal and the personal stake of Elias’s past failure. Escalation is steady and taut, if lacking a pronounced reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and tightens as comfort (poles) turns into a cage while the couple’s launch sharpens the absence. The meaningful turn is the pattern break—stepping off gravel, past the last pole, holding the compass out—which forecloses continued avoidance. Cost is emotional and ongoing rather than solved. Tension deepens without requiring an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (can he kindle empathy) coheres; pressure tightens as he chooses to leave safety, descend, and face the letter. The decisive deepening comes with the letter’s content reframing his quest. Cost is present but subtle—no overt loss beyond comfort and self‑protective numbness. A bit more friction or risk in the cave would sharpen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake is signaled early and deepens as the transformation accelerates, forcing the renunciatory choice. The key tightening arrives when his fear spikes at the ritual’s peak and he chooses surrender, paying with his human form. Internal and external pressures integrate well, with the ritual as action that cannot be deferred. The resolution grows from his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and clear: her fear of losing the present with her daughter. Pressure tightens via the remembered tablecloth failure and the present ritual; the turn is the unclasping and vow. The cost is the foreclosed path of “finding” lost time; no antagonist is needed. It’s a quiet escalation, but coherent and resolved by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—open the locked dimension—tightens meaningfully when she confronts her own photo, escalating from ancestral sorrow to origin wound. The cost intensifies (ship shudder, near‑crushing desolation), and her chosen tactic (acceptance) is tested and affirmed. The final stitch acts as a clear culminating action that converts inner resolution into external change. Stakes remain coherent and personal without telescoping into empty grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure rises via density and cadence: planet glow intensifies, the hum deepens, glyphs drink light, then the earth sighs. Stakes remain interior/atmospheric rather than adversarial, but the relinquishment of his collection is a visible price and the alignment imposes a soft clock. The detour tightens options toward the circle and legend without feeling contrived. Tension is quiet, yet it coheres and culminates decisively for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—seizing control quietly during the blackout—is clear, and tension concentrates around the keyed sequence and the chime. However, escalation is gentle; there’s no reversal or hard test that forces a trade-off beyond stealth. The tightening is a single beat (clicking IV–VII–II, breath held) rather than a compounded pressure. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—save the bluff and its patterns—is signaled early and escalates as the aurora “trigger” arrives with the wall of water. The tightening comes in the choice to use Elara’s last‑resort star dust, foreclosing future options. Resolution is earned by Kael’s agency and craft, not coincidence. A minor limitation: the solution unfolds smoothly with little visible risk of failure after the pour, softening peak tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—clarity vs. the cost of facing scars—is signaled early and tightened by the hour deadline. The ping is a meaningful turn that strips his mask and forces the choice to open and act, with trembling and fear as price. Internal and external pressures interweave (timer, locked panel, storm). The escalation is lean but coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—solve Elara’s overture—tightens as the sun approaches the final marker, creating a live clock. Escalation is present but elegant rather than visceral; no reversal, just convergence on a single high‑precision move. Agency drives the outcome, not coincidence. The price paid remains light (focus and timing), limiting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are coherent—protecting and rebuilding a haven of words—and the arrival of the drifters supplies the single tightening beat. Silas’s choice to welcome them rather than guard resources is the turn, tied to his Architect state. The visible price is underplayed; danger remains a suggestion rather than a felt cost. Tension is quiet but present, operating more in stance than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates under a ticking horizon and failing instruments. The meaningful tightening is the pivot from navigational tools to art‑math via the reel, culminating in the risky step through. Cost is present (leaving the last safe place, entering an undefined possibility), though it could cut a shade deeper on the page. Tension scales cleanly to the crescendo and doorway.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is explicit early: preserve collective memory before the monsoon. Escalation coheres as the weather turns, her panic spikes, then a pattern break (feeling-based interpretation) narrows options to a faith act. The price is the relinquishment of proof and the acceptance of enduring doubt. Resolution is protagonist-driven, though consequences arrive a touch too smoothly to feel punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can he alter his relationship to grief—tightens when the tide turns and the compass steadies, forcing a committed act (carrying it to the bluff and submitting to the mechanism). The cost is the relinquishment of a self‑punishing identity; memories remain but are reweighted. Escalation is quiet but legible and coherent with the chosen lens. Absence of a secondary complication keeps scope narrow but suited to length.

The conflict escalates not through overt action, but through the increasing weight of the cryptic messages, which deepens the protagonist's desperation.

    While the stakes of the spycraft exchange are clear, the on-page conflict lacks friction. Elias is so masterful that the execution of his plan feels inevitable, which lessens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    The conflict builds with quiet, inexorable pressure.

His choice to act is not a solution but a commitment to a dangerous path, leaving the tension high and the cost of engagement perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story's central stake—Elias's struggle against his paralyzing grief—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus.

The deepening is driven by his agency (he breaks the seal), and the visible cost is the collapse of the tableau and the impending arrival of disbelieving authorities.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—completion of the alchemical legacy—tightens via toxic intensification of plants and accelerating apparitions. Each glimpse raises the cost of knowledge (acid dew, hallucinogenic perfume). The final orchid bloom is the decisive intensification that forecloses Lyra’s presence and secures the inheritance. Agency is Elian’s continued tending despite danger; no external coincidence resolves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation: unconscious art-grown latticework → conscious fight to secure it against storm; pressure forces public-works shift from private dream to community survival walk.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore faith in lineage—tightens when the sundial’s underside forces a reevaluation. Agency: Elara’s choice to lift and place the stone crystallizes the new stance. Cost is the irreversible reframing of family memory. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering a new identity via analog stealth—is signaled early and tightens once: the chalk drawings must be perfect childish camouflage. The cost is the irrevocable exposure once the letter leaves his hand. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing the coup—escalates through each overheard fragment; the final tightening is the three-minute sync window that forces the irreversible transmission. Cost is the new silence and the risk of discovery. Agency remains with Elara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—locate the moment before choice—is signaled early and tightened when the condensation scene forces Kael to confront the boat memory. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: murmur → keening hymn → sigh. Cost is visible in Elara’s hollowed sway and Kael’s silent tears; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—bridging two hardened hearts—tightens when each decoded symbol strips abstraction from grief. The meaningful turn occurs when Elias chooses to speak the child’s fear aloud, trading tactical silence for human contact; the cost is the General’s loss of command distance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure tightens around the single stake—recovery of lost joy—until the mural snaps into focus; cost is the gentle fade of the daydream, cleanly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightens through each nested awakening; the final color choice forecloses the safe option with visible cost. Agency resides entirely in Elias’s sonic experiments; coincidence is absent. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting untaxable thought—escalates from passive surveillance to active probes. Seed insertion is a proactive, narrowing move with city-scale stakes and personal risk. Cost is legible: potential consciousness wipe. Pressure tightens in one continuous rise.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turning pain into beauty—escalates via texture shift: ache grinds into pearl. One decisive tightening: the pain no longer cages but “holds open a space.” Cost is the eternal vigil itself, now embraced rather than endured. Agency remains Elara’s; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve Simple Trust before it vanishes—tightens through each sensory beat; the act of lighting forecloses the option to save the living world, with the “bitter taste” as visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore trust or lose Elara—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each promise-glyph tightens the noose of consequence until the final lattice leaves no retreat. The cost is the spent ink and the irreversible exposure of inner silence. One decisive tightening suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love and duty—tightens when the chain’s cipher forces a new reading of the past. One decisive turn: discovery of the unsent letters reweights all prior assumptions. Cost is felt in Kaelen’s bodily tremor and the quiet vastness of the truth. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the letters were always there, waiting for his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve Lena’s music—faces a concrete test when water snakes toward the scores. Escalation is one decisive tightening: storm forces Elias to act, which forces truth. Agency is present in tarp, stool, and final gift; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the relinquished secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: accept permanent separation to grasp sacred thresholds. Pressure tightens when the logbook predicts the white gate; Elian’s agency crystallizes in the step through. No external antagonist; conflict is internal and ontological. Cost is the silence after the prismatic chaos—felt, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving belonging before sunrise—is signaled early and tightened by the literal clock. Escalation is accretive: flickering conduits, dwindling time, then the luminous payoff that reweights isolation into connection. Cost is visible in the feather’s softened edges and the irreversible sunrise departure. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—complete the recollection before memory decays—is signaled early and tightened once when the vines grey out. The cost is conceptual (loss of story) rather than visceral, but it suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—memory as resistance—tightens through widening gaps and deepening silence until the dance must succeed or fail. One decisive intensification: spontaneous anchoring narrows options to “become the pivot.” Cost is the irreversible bodily inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs. accept impermanence—tightens once: the stone’s rings reveal the atrium’s doom. Escalation is Accumulative: density of sensory and symbolic cues increases until the rainbow detonation. Cost is the forfeiture of the structure; agency lies in Silas’s refusal to resist the tide. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to transmit the cost of survival—tightens when Elias offers the box and Kaelen traces a crack. One meaningful deepening: the girl’s refusal to reclaim the box reframes the bargain from personal wound to transferable map. Agency remains Elias’s: he chooses to keep the fracture, foreclosing any return to innocence. Cost is visible in scar and porcelain.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove an equation for hope—tightens when the needle plunges, forcing a held-breath beat before the climb. Escalation is one smooth intensification under Accumulative lens: pattern submersion → light bloom → gauge rise. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the physical pattern each tide. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—the legacy’s burden of guilt—tightens through each scorched page; the discovery of Prometheus reframes the stakes from mere failure to active harm, forcing Elara’s renunciation. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—planting seeds of possibility—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking bell-curfew. Pressure is coherent but external; the painter’s agency is largely observational, so escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical. Still, the cost of relinquishing the borrowed heartbeat is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ending the Forever War—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through ritual escalation: each beat (history lesson, sigil, dust) raises the social cost of refusal. The decisive narrowing occurs when Kaelen’s trembling hand signs, forcing Vorlag’s surrender; the price is the generals’ public renunciation of identity. Agency remains with Elias’s orchestration, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve or surrender the last echo—tightens once, irrevocably, when the shell dissolves. Pressure is Accumulative: silence, heat, and memory accrue until the act forecloses resurrection. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Cost is visible in the hollow resonance and the coming rain that will salt the wound.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity via subliminal rebellion—is signaled early and tightened through the dance of untangling. Each knot’s release escalates psychic pressure until the final thread (judge’s regret) triggers the wave. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elara forfeits her role as secret keeper and becomes the city’s conscience. Agency drives every beat; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—ethical responsibility for the audience’s despair—tightens when the hollow-eyed man’s stillness revisits Kaelen. One meaningful turn: the decision to answer the prior show with a new one, narrowing options from pure provocation to dialogic provocation. Cost is the risk of further harm and the loss of artistic purity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—honoring the last migration—tightens as each butterfly passes through an archway, foreclosing rescue. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the irreversible disappearance of both species and structures. Escalation is one deepening cadence shift under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve Lyra’s name—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: from “preserve sound” to “honor memory with light,” a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs transcend the directive—tightens when the storm breaches the bunker. Agency is exercised in the irreversible act of ingestion; the wafer’s dissolution forecloses ancestral guardianship. Cost is visceral: ancestral lineage ends, bunker collapses, yet Kael gains presence. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory intensification (dust, water, taste) reweights the stake until renunciation is the only path.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown—tightens as planetary alignment narrows to a single dusk. Escalation is one deepening: the schematic’s completion forecloses any further attempt; the cost is the irreversible secrecy. No reversals needed; the tension is the risk of cosmic indifference. Agency is absolute: Kavi’s meticulous placement of the tile triggers the sky’s answer.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—heal Vale or reality dies—is signaled early and tightens when the sanctuary itself begins to tear. The mid-story recoil intensifies pressure under causal lens: Elara’s gentle push literally rips the pocket. Cost is legible: she must risk annihilation to offer the final suggestion; the harmonic hum is the paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recreate the lost dream—is signaled early and tightened when the frost begins to obey her breath. The cost is legible: the vision lasts only three breaths before shattering. Agency is high; coincidence does not intrude. One meaningful intensification meets the bar.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the Heartwood—tightens once when Elian realizes the fracture is germination, not damage. Agency drives the escalation: he abandons archaic tools and chooses support over repair. The cost (loss of certainty, of the ribbon) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Kaelen break the mandate to understand?—is signaled early and tightens once when he chooses inquiry in the bathroom. The cost is conceptual: he forfeits his safe ignorance and accepted role. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reach the hidden library to avert future collapse—is signaled early and escalates through each beat: public stacks → forbidden map → silent wall → renegotiation. The final trade-off (risk of Curators’ wrath vs. future burning) lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve self vs. resurrect twin—tightens with each swatch as memories bleed. The final swatch forecloses the option of retrieval, exacting the price of irreversible solitude. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. One beat could sharpen the cost earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure tightens through the “impossible door → seal match → ceremonial rope” beat chain, narrowing Elias's option from puzzle to integration, but the tension leans academic; a sharper, bodily-felt price would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the quiet—is signaled early and escalates as the hum sharpens to a “needle-point.” One decisive tightening: the conjuring moment where silence is risked against possible collapse. Cost is felt in the cave shudder and Kaelen’s exhaustion. Agency drives every beat; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—breaking two-generation silence—signaled early and intensifies. Progressive narrowing: each calculation forecloses doubt; alignment narrows time to singular minute. Tightening legible: “for years” compresses to “tonight.” Cost embedded: accepting memory scream in order to end silence—price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose or honor the engineered forgetting—is signaled early and tightened by each lightning flash. The midpoint escalation (discordant crystal hum) forces Kael to act; the final choice forecloses the path of revelation in favor of compassionate witness, with the cost of lifelong solitude in that knowledge. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (the three-second bolt) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened when the knot reframes perception. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible in the shift from passive listening to active creation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to respond to Kael’s departure—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through Elara’s tangential observation until the final crystallization forecloses protest or pleading. Cost is the ache beneath her calm, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—find a silence that does not suffocate—is signaled early and tightened when gravity inversion offers a single hour. Escalation is one deepening: the higher he falls, the more the silence expands. Cost is visible on return—the bunker still feels small but panic is gone, foreclosing retreat. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only frames the window.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the passenger be claimed by silence or learn to inhabit it—tightens through Elian’s guided micro-listening exercises. Escalation is incremental and textural rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is the passenger’s relinquished noise-shield and Elian’s perpetual return to solitude; both are legible but lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—sunrise purge—tightens with every peeled layer. Escalation is causal: each removed stratum narrows time and raises the cost of error. The climax hinges on a precise, irreversible act that forecloses any later claim to the throne; the cost is the orchard’s silent absorption of her personal future.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates from whispered debt-lure to cosmic promise-bomb, all under Elara’s agency. Final crystallization narrows the farm’s fate: diamonds or collapse. Slight convenience in her lone volition.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the dynasty’s secret—is signaled early and tightened by each crank turn. The pressure peaks when the standing waves threaten to “crack glass,” forcing the final intuitive surrender. Cost is visible: the dynasty’s erasure becomes her peace.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate from failing equations → collapse of possibility → personal death/undoing → cosmos rebirth; each rise costs Kaelen autonomy (armour breach, final severance). Single, coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—magnifying kindness—tightens once when the button’s message reweights Elara’s task from cataloging to consecrating. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and emotional. The cost is conceptual (accepting perpetual incompleteness), visible in the ceremonial sleeve.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—holding memory against erasure—tightens once: from silent network to city-wide crack. Agency is pure endurance; the cost is irreversible exposure. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification (silence → golden pulse → flickering screens) under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy from becoming syntax—is signaled early and tightened once: the coded drips falter under deliberate musical starvation. Cost is visible in the final solitude and eerie nostalgia. Agency is Elias’s continuous act; no external coincidence resolves the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—escalates through pattern recognition and culminates in the irreversible acceptance of chaos; the cost is the relinquishing of repair as purpose, though the beat is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“redeem memory without resurrection”—is signaled early and tightened by each reagent burn. The visible cost (his spent life-force) narrows options to a single irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the spirit’s wholeness—tightens through escalating sonic distortion that peaks in a painful shriek, then resolves into a single clear chime. The cost is the emotional toll on Silas, visible in the warming tooth against his chest.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove mercy is computable—signaled early and tightened when the forest is revealed as experiment stage. Agency: brace action narrows options, crystallizes stance. Cost: “perish in the static” remains live threat. No external antagonist needed; pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—honoring erased histories—is signaled early and tightened through the discovery of the *St. Elmo*. The “unfastening” act narrows options, yet the price paid (loss of the lens’s weight?) remains more poetic than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—repair the crack in the veil—tightens once when Leo chooses to engage rather than leave. Escalation is causal: ghost’s agitation → dust anomaly → ladder ascent → retrieval. Cost is felt in the ghost’s release and Leo’s quiet acceptance of an unspoken covenant. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberty of change versus static perfection—is signaled early and tightened once: the frost code overloads the system, foreclosing preservation. Agency is renunciation enacted through frost-tracing; cost is the library’s dissolution. Escalation is a single decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Meets high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring a civilization’s dignity—tightens when the shard’s vision forecloses Valerius’s narrative and demands a new academic battle. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost of recommitment is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—world’s decay versus one man’s truth—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each wire twist raises the cost of failure; the rust-voice tightens psychological pressure. The decisive tightening occurs when Elias rejects the lie, foreclosing retreat. Price is the moment of near-total dimming of the chip and the irreversible exposure of his humility.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—survive the wave—signaled early and escalates via the slide’s revelation. One decisive tightening: the diagram forces Elara to act as custodian, not observer. Agency drives resolution; the bulwark’s pattern is her choice, paid for with soaked exhaustion. No coincidence resolves; the wave’s redirection is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is dramatized through escalating discovery: dormant buds → cosmic roots → ancestral portrait. Each filter reveals a deeper layer, tightening the mystery’s grip. Cost is felt in Elara’s “umbral tenderness” and the dawning hush she now carries. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth behind Elara’s encrypted pain—is signaled early and tightens through each silent parley attempt. Escalation is textural: despair accumulates until the shift to legacy/peace message reframes options. Cost is the irreversible weeks lost, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore authentic life without illusion—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each memory tightens the cost (physical strain, lifetime commitment). The second lantern’s glow marks the decisive intensification. Agency remains with Kaelen; no external coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—city’s emotional survival—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: the stylus accidentally records an external intelligence that reframes the archive as lure. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elian must betray his life’s work. Agency is cerebral (decision to forget) yet forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the pocket reality—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the accelerating dissolution. Escalation is textural: shards of memory spiral faster until the final breath re-orders them. Agency is Elara’s patient invitation, not force; cost is the irrevocable change in her perception of time. No secondary pressure or antagonist, but the single beat suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“hear the sky’s true voice”—tightens through countdown beats; the switch forecloses the sirens’ path with irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will Kael remain a passive observer or risk empathic contact—tightens once when he presses the glass to the eyepiece. The single deepening (shared burn) narrows his options and forces the stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: the star’s death becomes his own momentary death, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake—freeing tethered ghosts—intensifies from mute vigil to decisive unsealing. The tightening is earned rather than escalated spectacle; suffices for lyric-accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering the texture of lost time—tightens when the traveler’s message forces a decisive interface with the silo. The escalation is one deepening beat, but the felt cost (Kael’s relinquishment of his remaining time) is legible in the final chord.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—witnessing and transmuting small grief—tightens once when Kaelen chooses tending over comforting. The pressure is situational: the kite’s loss cannot be undone, so agency becomes attention and re-weaving. Cost is conceptual (ethical omission) rather than visceral, slightly softening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bridge two solitudes before death—is signaled early and tightened by each copper wrap. Agency is renunciation: he trades remaining strength for a legacy that outlives him. One clear escalation: the low hum rising to synchronous pulse narrows options to acceptance. Cost is embodied in his collapse against the pillar.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—grow life in memory of loss—signaled early and tightened through bird-guided seed placement; pressure widens from impossibility to incremental first-biome sublimation. Agency remains steady without daring reversal or measurable price beyond fatigue, gliding short of 8.8 dissipation threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—tightens as the temporal stretch intensifies; the glimpse forecloses linear certainty and exacts the cost of irrevocable perceptual exile.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: free the paradox before the sky’s wrongness calcifies. Escalation is one steady tightening: climb → breach → swap → seed released. Agency is Kael’s throughout; coincidence is absent. Cost is the invisible forfeiture of any reward beyond wonder. The tightening narrows options to “plant or retreat.”

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Elara vs Regent’s silence versus speech—tightens through escalating beat-by-beat risk: letter-steps, tapping response, public display of raw grief, final command spelling. Agency demonstrated via physical, bodily choices that incrementally increase exposure. Regent’s ‘benevolent ruthlessness’ is pressure; the silent act of turning the key is consequence. The pattern of walking that forms words is the specific tactic that causes the tightening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens once when the stone disappoints, forcing a deeper method. The feather-beat escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens, with felt cost in her trembling hand, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightened through each decoded thread; every insight forecloses denial. The single decisive turn is the recognition of the “simple, defensive move,” paid for by the town’s release and Elias’s relinquishment of perfection. Agency is intellectual, but the price is real.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—the price of forgiveness—tightens once: from whispered doubt to irreversible sonic fracture. The single deepening is sufficient; Elara’s agency drives the escalation, and the cost (imminent capture) is legible on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—save the last story—tightens with every scar, but escalation leans on narration rather than visible narrowing of live options.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—building a lighthouse for the lost—is signaled early and tightens once: the midnight call forces the decisive placement of the bronze. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible exposure of his own unhealed loss.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety—tightens from abstract need to concrete silence when the relic’s attunement succeeds. One meaningful escalation: the storm peaks, forcing the occlusion act. Cost is visible—season’s truffles gone, memory cordoned off. Agency is Elias’s; coincidence only complicates (storm timing), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens through nightly sessions with the flower; the deepening is the realization that the man came to drown his memory. The cost is Silas’s acceptance of shared grief, but the escalation is more accretive than sharply tested, limiting entry to the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—fulfill Elara’s promise before the creek seals the fissure—tightens once when the doorway appears and Elias chooses not to enter. Escalation is causal and driven by his agency; the cost is the irrevocable acceptance of his single lived path. No extraneous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape vs duty—tightens once when the light shows the price of forgetting. Agency is hers: she pulls her hand back and chooses descent. Cost is the lifelong burden of guarding others. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: retain Kael’s felt presence vs abstract perfection. Escalation tightens once—departure threat intensifies urgency—closing with visible price (Kael walking away, Elara’s renunciation). No external reversals; coherence under Accumulative lens. Minor: stakes never grow beyond personal, but the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—distill the chronologically broken self into art—is signaled early and intensifies through “feral nostalgia” and self-loathing. The deepening happens in midflight when the map blurs into one curve; this single pressure point is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the surrender of jealousy itself. No external reversals or antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she still “read” meaning without smell—tightens once when the screw is placed in her palm. Escalation is accretive: each droplet and worn thread increases emotional density.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before obliteration—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single, deepening sensory swell that forecloses any further negotiation with the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake: learn the physics of letting go. Tightening occurs when Kael realizes the distortions aren’t enemies to repel but people needing egress; choice to weaken the perimeter, not strengthen it, directly forecloses forever keeping her “familiar” form within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled early and escalates through denser, riskier mappings.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. home—tightens when Elara’s plea fails and Kaelen detaches the island. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options until only departure remains.

    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty” vs rigid control—tightens on each beat until vines overtake statues. Protagonist agency drives escalation: shell placement, violin signal, uproot. Visible price: exhaustion and personal expenditure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reuniting a ghost-daughter with her family—tightens when the thirty-second upload window narrows to a single irreversible corridor. Agency is Elias’s precise timing and the irreversible expenditure of the storm. Cost is legible in the spent bottle and the silent bluebird, foreclosing any second attempt tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“where stories live”—receives one clean intensification when Elias actually glimpses the pool, then a tightening into inaction; the price is the vision’s vanishing and the choice to wait. Escalation is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the runaway dream—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the prismatic fog promises the “final piece,” forcing a last use of the palette’s single empty well; cost is the irrevocable filling of that well, foreclosing further pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped music—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the star’s appearance triggers the disorientation sequence, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the dissolution of the lock itself. Agency is the Locksmith’s resonant hum; coincidence (star timing) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightened when the fracture in Polaris forces the decision to break the no-contact rule. Escalation is one decisive intensification: lifelong observation collapses into action. The cost is the irreversible shift from scholar to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s readiness to return—tightens when Kael’s reading reveals the memory she must surrender. Escalation is causal: each annotation raises the price of failure. The final renunciation forecloses the immediate path with visible cost (kneeling, restacking). No external coincidence dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled in paragraph one and tested by the grey incursion. Escalation is causal: each luminous thread gathered tightens the risk of depleting the veil. The final sprouting forecloses the option of ever retrieving the borrowed wonder; the cost is the seed’s singularity now anchoring the world.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (grounding restless spirits) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening: each unraveling both heals and re-strengthens the sanctuary hush—escalation under causal lens. Cost is cumulative exhaustion, visible in the elder’s drained state and the admission that thousands remain. The final scene crystallizes that the pressure will not merely fade.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interpret the silence without violating it—tightens when the lichen rectangle proves the door was opened once. The single deepening beat (discovery of the seam) forces Elara to decide between knowledge and preservation; the cost is the irreversible acknowledgment of the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens when the globe’s stasis reveals the cost of refusal. One meaningful tightening: the narrator’s decision to leave the anchor redefines options. Cost is conceptual but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—articulating Lyra’s unspoken loneliness—tightens through the lightning-thunder countdown; the graffiti act is the decisive, costly escalation. Pressure is coherent, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: protect Elara’s hidden hope. Pressure escalates with each floor; the sketch tightens the conflict from abstract grief to concrete maternal love. Agency: Kael’s decision to guard the secret forecloses disclosure. Cost is silent—he shoulders the weight alone. No reversals, but deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the void retains Lena—tightens with each cloud named; the noctilucent fractal forces the decisive crystallization. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals are needed. Cost is visible in Elias’s final refusal to record, accepting permanent drift.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trap wonder before demolition—tightens as machinery revives. One decisive turn: she chooses to stay and press the stone, foreclosing escape. Agency drives escalation; cost is the imminent collapse felt in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—chart the luminance—tightens when the birds’ dance is decoded into actionable sequence. One clear reversal: the luminance shifts from “stranded” to “navigating,” forcing Elias to revise his goal from discovery to conversation. The cost is the irreversible passage of twilight and the solitude that enabled focus.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the Orrery or remain in perpetual twilight—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the blinding light forces the eclipse gambit, foreclosing all other solutions. Cost is the irreversible expenditure of the last eclipse essence and the psychic weight of countless failed selves. Agency remains with Elara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—escape to the nebula—is signaled early and tightened by each chalk command. The climb narrows options to one perilous ascent; success costs leaving the ghost behind. Agency is collective but protagonist-driven. No escalation after the bell rings, yet the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—grant a secret benediction to the dying world—tightens once: Elias’s energy drains into the pattern, foreclosing any chance of escape. The cost is visible in his “ragged, satisfied sighs” and the pane’s collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guide the traveler before lethal frost—signaled early. Escalation is a single meaningful tightening: the frost clock narrows options, forcing the costly beacon use. Agency is Elias’s decision to spend the nut; the price is the cracked husk. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the traveler’s escape is earned by Elias’s action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    Divergence as theme nuances the central tension yet only funds a single deepening beat without narrowing live options beyond the foam vision.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Kaelen’s need to blunt or transmute accumulated remorse—is signaled early and tightened when the fossil’s memory-map forces a single path. The deepening occurs inside the grotto: each mote narrows options until subsuming becomes the only exit. Cost is visceral—“an agony that scoured him clean”—and the pavilion’s dissolution confirms the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—rehabilitating psychic elevators—escalates as screeching isolation modulates into polyphonic chorus. Causal pressure accumulates; each layered voice tightens the remaining space for failure. Cost: Elias's exhaustion and the perpetual 'quiet promise' signal an ongoing toll.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—personal erasure versus cultural preservation—tightens through escalating neural strain; the single decisive intensification is the cortex remapping that forecloses her former perceptual limits. Cost is visceral: “tremor in her soul.”

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent intellectual flattening via forbidden synthesis—is signaled early and tightened when the equation appears: possessing it forces Kael to assume guardianship. Escalation is causal: each step deeper increases physical and moral cost (looming stone rain, irreversible knowledge). Final narrowing of options crystallizes in the charged poise of guardianship. Price is visible in the extinguished light and lifelong burden accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—turning silence into music—tightens through each resonant C, G, and fragile chord; agency lies in her deliberate strums that foreclose the option of imposed melody, with the price of vulnerability felt in her chest.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in difficulty—tightens as each silence decoded raises the cost of possible failure; the auroral reveal is the single decisive intensification that forecloses doubt and exacts the price of exile recontextualized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he preserve grandma’s loving silence amidst communal noise—signaled early. Escalation tightens when first firework load thuds: time window narrows, forcing intuitive leap. Cost legible on the page in the choice to not read; no reversals required. Stake never drifts into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“achieve balance in motion”) is signaled early and narrows when windstorm threatens collapse of that balance. Escalation tracked viscerally: mounting olfactory assault until “pain bloomed behind her eyes.” Renunciation—abandoning control of flower as symbol of ego—costs prior definition of success and visibly alters tactics, narrowing options to only remaining path: inward quiet partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the orchard—tightens when the hourglass of inversion forces the shard theft. Pressure escalates via the arrow’s frantic pitch and the falling droplets. Cost is on-page: she races the reasserted gravity, forfeits the arrow’s guidance, and accepts an unknown future. No external antagonist needed; time and physics suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understand the physics of the quiet—tightens when the patch forces a skyward pivot, narrowing options from ground-level to aerial vectors. Escalation is causal: each re-calibration raises the cost of error until the nexus reveals irreversible cessation. No coincidence resolves; the convergence is the pressure. Cost is felt in the “hollow victory” and the weight of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and escalates through each bell strike, tightening from oppressive hush to vibrant stillness. Agency is Kael’s alone; coincidence (the distant sculptor) triggers but does not resolve. The cost is legible: the cavern’s silence is forever lost, yet the personal price remains abstract, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the first tentative note becomes a question rather than a command. The spiral of driftwood and the played melody escalate by increasing density until the shimmer reweights the flute’s meaning; the cost is the “clean, sharp pain” of recognition. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure suffices. The final renunciation of old tactics forecloses the guardian path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“shape grief into a readable pattern”—is pinned early and distilled in the final imprint. Micro-middle: fracture of emotions into equation tightens stakes from raw sorrow to transferable artifact. No multiple reversals, yet centrifugal pressure suffices for a single-crescendo design.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—carry wonder vs. stay safe—tightens when the pendant activates and forecloses the routine hand-off option. One meaningful deepening: the garden of frozen light forces a stance crystallization. Cost is the irreversible shift in identity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prove objects retain emotional memory—is tested and inverted in a single, decisive tightening. Pressure escalates via environmental alignment (sunrise, frost) and culminates in the schematic that forecloses poetic consolation. Cost is legible: Elias’s worldview fractures on the page. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the prism delivers the verdict it was built to deliver.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—send the message—tightens via escalating price: each memory spun into cloth narrows future options until only the bead remains. The recommence beat forces the irrevocable final weave; cost is visceral (loss of his name). No external reversals needed; pressure is internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each descent and memory-forfeit. The single meaningful turn (offering the plum memory) narrows options and exacts a visible price. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover and neutralize the truth behind Elara’s death—tightens once the cascade is recognized; the redirect is a clear trade-off that forecloses rescue. Pressure escalates under causal logic; cost (permanent loss of contact) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect the light and the unspoken bond—is signaled immediately via lamp failure. One decisive intensification: lamp dies → solitary ascent amid storm. Cost legible when solitary "Farewell" stone acknowledges keeper is gone forever.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—shaping the storm—tightens as the wick glows white-hot and the tower resonates; cost is visible exhaustion and the unforeseen prophetic echo. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the woman’s magnetism—tightens through accumulating light-pattern evidence. Cost is conceptual: Kaelen forfeits the need to possess the mystery, embracing witness instead. One clear deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—will this shard’s sorrow find coherent rest?—tightens once when moonlight transmutes anguish into acceptance, foreclosing further manipulation. Pressure grows via accumulating sorrow-density rather than causal turns; the cost is the irreversible hour before dawn and the quiet admission that the task is endless.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore sunrise or lose realm and self—intensifies as each plant-care micro-beat yields a lyric fragment, narrowing options to the final song. Cost is felt: she must surrender her fractured self to become the vessel. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—the paradox of connection vs overwhelm—is signaled early, tightens once when Elias witnesses Elara’s grief, and narrows to the single act of leaving the invitation: a decision that re-weights their shared solitude with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defiance against erasure—tightens when the patrolman appears; the moment of mutual recognition deepens rather than reverses. Agency is present but the cost (risk of arrest, social credit) remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent betrayal via the fob—is signaled early and escalates through three failed tactics. The final lie narrows Silas’s options to zero; Eva’s disgust is the visible price. Pressure is coherent and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake—prove/disprove the emergent compass—tightens as carriers converge and weather systems merge; the aurora’s intervention deepens rather than resolves the mystery, leaving a felt cost of unanswered mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The inherited equipment box vs suppressed artistry frames the single escalating conflict; every appeasing patron laugh raises the price until the last bolt click forecloses the hollow-money path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes—re-growing honesty in lieu of dried oasis—signalled in first paragraph and escalate: each map fragment narrows possible routes, culminating in irrevocable seeding. Cost is literal stakes of staying hidden versus communal exposure. No external antagonist required; escalation flows through protagonist agency. Slight compression in corridor transit dulls spike.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—keeping wonder alive—tightens once when the wind arrives and forces the irreversible performance. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the sculpture’s dissolution. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static or remain caged—is signaled early and tightened once: chaos compression forces trade-off between safety and selfhood. Escalation is causal, agency-driven, with visible price (dome breach, garden loss). No reversals needed; single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: heal the neighborhood tear by proving listening works. Escalation tightens from drilling threat → locket lockpick → bequest payoff, all driven by Elias’s stance crystallization. No luck resolves; community action funded by rings is earned choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—free her mother’s splintered consciousness—remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when chance replaces logic, narrowing the decryption method from pure analysis to embodied surrender. Cost is largely conceptual/psychic rather than externalized obstacle, fitting the word count yet leaving the tightening less visceral than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—prevent prophecy-driven chaos—is declared early and tightens through each paragraph as the “insidious rustle” is hunted gap by gap. Agency is interior and accumulative: Elara’s mapping and tide-like release meaningfully deepen the stakes rather than flip them. A visible personal price is absent, so escalation feels atmospheric, not visceral, capping the band below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sustaining illusion—tightens once: the rooftop interrogation forces Clara to choose. Agency is hers; Elias only answers when asked. Cost is the emotional forfeiture of their safe ritual. No coincidence; pressure is internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—escalates as memory’s pain rises; the last-star deadline sharpens the final push. Agency drives every turn; cost is visible in the tear and the shell’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“unlink present from vendetta without shattering the past”—is signaled early and tightened once: one glyph amendment narrows centuries of warfare down to a single ink-dot. Cost is visible: tremor after act and the risk of discovery. No outside coincidence rescues; pressure is entirely Kaelen’s steadying his breath against echoing drips. The final image crystallizes the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why some echo—signaled in paragraph one; pressure escalates via each warped echo and warming shell until the final harmonic choice forecloses the question and imposes lifelong duty. Cost is legible: perpetual service replacing curiosity. One clear tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—salvaging a pure truth from the wreckage—tightens through each dream cameo until the shared dream forces the man’s confession and the boy’s release. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (deepening trance, weaving images). Cost is legible: the globe remains broken, the vigil eternal.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are atmospheric and thematic rather than causal; pressure accumulates as sensory saturation but never tightens into a ‘must act or lose’ moment. The whistle beat complicates but does not close an option—escalation is lyrical, not decisive—so while it deepens the textural weave, it does not visibly foreclose a path with palpable loss under an Accumulative/Textural reading.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs myth—escalates as each document shard reweights the orchard’s value. One decisive tightening: Kaelen’s intuitive refocusing of light reveals the stillpoint, foreclosing the locals’ belief system. Cost is the conceptual erosion of their protective story. Agency remains with Kaelen; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will Elian choose a shadow master or forge a third dawn?—tightens when the duet of contradictory futures screams from the receiver. The map’s third path narrows options and forces the costly broadcast. Pressure is coherent; the price (loss of spectral patronage, risk of failure) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: to redeem the box’s silence without restoring its original song. Pressure tightens as each jar is opened, foreclosing the option to keep the sounds. Cost is the permanent release of the captured echoes—felt on the page when the loft falls into “a new kind of silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the Heart—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is coherent: hum intensifies → tower shudders → Elara adapts via vibrational matching. One meaningful tightening: the moment frequencies lock in a “violent shriek” forces the final push. Cost is visceral (molecular remaking, bodily scream). No reversals needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—quiet severance of Authority’s yoke—signaled early. Escalation is causal: rain → altered viaduct → moon convergence → single pulse. One meaningful tightening suffices; the final blackout is earned, not coincidental, with audible cost in the vanished lifelong hum.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. convenience—tightens when the notebook forces Elias to choose integrity over expediency. The lantern’s psychic pressure escalates stakes under causal logic; cost is the career friction he accepts in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Arthur’s need to atone for failing Thorne—tightens when Elias reframes the task from repair to witness. The single deepening beat (light through clouds) narrows Arthur’s options without external antagonist. Cost is felt in Arthur’s relinquishment of the heart and his prior pastoral method. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no reversals, but one decisive reweighting suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the Yearning Algorithm by risking death—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened to a knife-edge when the sea rushes up. Escalation is causal and irreversible: each modification to the wing narrows escape routes until only “grip” remains. Cost is visceral: permanent exile above lethal waters.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—find Julian’s erased truth—escalates from quiet search to corporate quarantine breach. Each beat raises cost: risk of discovery, ethical collision, irreversible data release. The tightening is single but decisive; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the community split?”—escalates via agency: Kael’s mirror use tightens options and gains Jorn’s nod, ending the weighted breath with felt relational cost. One genuine tightening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—learn the sound of endings—tightens via accumulative pressure: each salvaged relic and the ice’s slow calving narrow her attention to a single, audible release. No external reversals needed; the deepening texture itself forges the decisive moment. Cost is the ethical stain of voyeuristic relief work, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Mourvèdre/Grenache mismatch and still-rekindling letter create escalating, non-reversible stakes. His final choice to tend rather than guard redefines agency at cost—peace purchased by surrendering the fantasy of perfect placement.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve ungarbled wisdom—is signaled early and tightened when zealotry distorts it. Escalation is single but sufficient: the disciple’s loud misreading forces Kael’s descent and irreversible act. Cost is the solitude of guardianship, felt on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completion of the healing mosaic—escalates through seasonal returns and accumulating photographs. One decisive intensification occurs when the girl’s gesture completes the spiral, foreclosing further additions. Cost is felt in Elias’s solitary departure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will trap language anew in writing—tightens with each sonic fragment, culminating in an earned renunciation that costs both legacy and certainty. Pressure builds steadily via the auditory mosaic rather than external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each forgotten marker. The final circle is a visible price: the option to possess is foreclosed, replaced by participation. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—station survival—tightens through the accelerating hand. One decisive tightening: Elias’s restructure gambit forecloses continued time-flow. Agency is clear; cost is the frozen future. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single dominant stake: repair fractured love before death. Escalation occurs through ritual density—the reprise of the intact record in the room’s charged stillness forecloses all other actions. Agency is Elara’s but remains secondary; the protagonists’ silence carries greater felt tension than her own decisions, muting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find where noon-shadows go—tightens when the automaton’s projection reveals the fold; the option to “re-seal” the truth is foreclosed by the spent mechanism. Escalation is causal: each re-learned rune narrows the path to the single irreversible activation. Cost is the automaton’s permanent dormancy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is internal: whether he will continue rationalist disavowal or pay the cost of belief. Pressure tightens through each physical sensation—dirt, sting, gleam—until the single choice to sit and draw stars narrows options forever. Price is irreversible loss of certainty, expressed in the chart’s black ink and visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—create light without fire—tightens through tactile escalation: dull glass → vibrant core → self-sustaining glow. The single decisive intensification occurs when twilight strikes and the shard answers, narrowing options to this one quiet solution. Cost is implied (solitude, renunciation of prior fire), but not yet viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Kaelen’s frozen shame vs. Elara’s offer of thaw—is signaled early and tightened once: the drip pattern becomes the visible test of whether stasis can become flow. Agency is Elara’s quiet proactivity culminating in the pendant proffer; cost is her surrender of permanence. Pressure grows accumulatively; no reversals needed. The viral aftermath remains abstract, slightly blunting visceral escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—atonement to abandoned stories—is signaled early and escalates as each cameo intensifies guilt. The tightening occurs when the current becomes a gale, forcing the choice to bury the shell; this narrows options from rescue to ritual release. Cost is the irreversible loss of authorship.

    Dominant stake: translate a child’s terror into safe passage. Pressure tightens once—from frantic pulse to steady beacon—via Kaelen’s irreversible expenditure of personal stillness.

Escalation is causal under the lens: each alchemic step narrows options until the final ignition forecloses Kaelen’s rest.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore the harvest of echoes—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each mapped angle tightens the possible solution space until only one reconstruction remains. Cost is time and solitude; the “wounded season” externalizes the pressure. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Kaelen’s solitary task of transmuting sorrow—tightens once when the new grief arrives and calcifies. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the cumulative weight of silence he must bear, visible in the expanding mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harvest usable wisdom from loss—tightens once: the memory of stillness versus fear escalates to the carving of an “exhale.” The kettle’s crescendo supplies coherent pressure; the cost is the irreversible first cut that forecloses other memorials. Agency remains internal but visible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes crest when Kael’s admission strips away his last self-protective narrative, tightening options to acceptance or disintegration; the pressure is coherent and intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can this ruin still point toward hope?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each obstacle (dead grid, missing key, limited fuel). The final illumination is earned by her agency and carries an unmistakable cost: the generators will soon die, the vision is temporary.

    The dominant stake—uncovering the architecture of lies—tightens through the salvage act and the journal’s disclosure; the cost is the irrevocable shift in Kael’s filial understanding. One clear escalation suffices, though the external stakes (family danger) remain off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclamation of a disappearing language—is explicit early. Tightening delivered in one decisive cartography choice; fog’s encroachment acts as lived clock, forcing act within the whiteout. Cost legible: rope remains physically unchanged, but its exclusivity is transferred; stakes shift from potential loss to recorded, shareable survival. Coherent pressure under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding Elara’s absence—tightens once when Kaelen realizes her “explained absence was the most triumphant journey.” The deepening is driven by his agency in projection and writing; cost is the deepening cold and the irrevocable nightfall. No external reversals are needed; the internal shift suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early and tightened through each failed refinement of the incubator. The final cadence shift (machines falter) shows a visible price paid. Agency remains Kaelen’s throughout; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens when the banyan’s survival hinges on Elara’s graft. One meaningful escalation: the coin’s sacrifice narrows options and exacts a felt price. Pressure remains coherent under the causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each breadcrumb narrows the path to the single moment of starlight alignment. The final rotation is the decisive act that forecloses her former detachment; the cost is the city’s awakening she must now witness. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the geese merely mark the irreversible timing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—break the cycle of sacrificial renewal—is signaled early and tightened when Xylar re-tools the pings from query to gift. The cost is the abandonment of the ancestral computational path, paid on the page. Escalation is a single deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Pressure stays coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightened by nightly ritual and storm pressure. One deepening: the storm forces the final stroke that completes the web, foreclosing the option of individual epitaphs. Cost is the abandonment of the grandmother’s literal inscription, traded for the abstract pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—the town’s haunted equilibrium—escalates each year as Elias adds another mark, deepening moral price. The ritual pause shrinks temporal options; letting the wooden handle slip severs one path and charges closure. Pressure remains coherent, luck not used.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the shape of abandoned intentions—is signaled early and tightens through each decoded thread until the map forecloses alternative readings. One meaningful deepening: the case’s pulse confirms the map’s truth, narrowing options to reunion or acceptance. Cost is the acceptance of a future forever deferred. Agency remains with Elias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—collective survival versus cultural betrayal—escalates causally toward the point of no return. One decisive tightening arrives when the choice to mark the vellum becomes visible on the page, eliminating the option to wait. Cost is felt in the “slow thaw rather than a shattering flood” trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserve memory itself under total prohibition—escalates through quiet accumulation: each silent note becomes a small act of treason that raises cumulative risk. Once luminous text appears, a tangible price is felt: discovery could mean death for Elias and all future listeners. Coherence is perfect; the tightening narrows action rather than resolving it, sustaining tension to the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Competing narratives drive all stakes: the girl’s myth and Silas’s chronometer grind against each other, narrowing his choices to solitary archivist. No miracles—only the rising pressure to keep or dispose of the cog tightens once into a stance crystallization that forecloses further evangelism.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore wonder vs. sterile truth—tightens when Silas withholds the direct answer, forcing Lena to re-experience discovery. One decisive deepening: the riddle reframes the blackout from technical failure to cultural suffocation. Cost is the risk that Lena may still fail.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reversing creeping sterility—is signaled early and tightened through each object displacement. The escalation is one sustained intensification rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens; the cost is the risk of exposure and the relinquishing of anonymity. Slight deduction for off-stage neighbor conversions that soften the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent desecration—escalates as each revelation reweights the mission from righteous purge to piracy. The single tightening beat (realizing the “weakness” is a lung) narrows options to poison or renounce; cost is legible in the burial act. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“he sought the texture”—escalates in micro-densifications of proof, each scratch adding pressure. The rolled seven is agency crystallised, forcing paradox; tension peaks at exact cost (the rupture smells of real rain). No secondary stakes dilute focus.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prove that kindness survives as a living language. Escalation arrives each night (canvas 1… 6) then a single decisive risk—public exposure. Cost is visible: years of insomnia, the shattering silence after broadcast, and finally the self-directed accusation “fool.” Intensification is accretive, not causal; under Accumulative lens this counts as tightening that re-scales private act to civic mirror. No reversals needed; the final reverb of windows narrowing the void is felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—cultural and physical survival—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through visible ice fractures. The tightening beat is the shift from “we can only pray” to “we can persuade it,” paid for by risking the last communal voice. Cost is audible: the city’s silence replaced by thunder, their anthem now their lifeline.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape fate—signaled in first paragraph. Pressure escalates via causal linkage: tide’s nadir triggers lever pull, which forecloses all futures. Cost is visible: “scarred knuckles…soften.” One decisive turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—trick Fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and tightened once via the unbosoming trap. Escalation is causal: each paradoxical note narrows options until the final reversal. Cost is the permanent void-anchor, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: survival of the fragile raft. Escalation tightens once—storm peak → Kai’s percussive counter-rhythm—foreclosing destruction and replacing it with harmonic endurance. Cost is the orchard’s structural fatigue and Kai’s exhaustion, legible in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the watchers—tightens through each deciphered shimmer until the map reveals extinction. Agency is intellectual endurance; the cost is the whistle and the certainty of doom. One decisive deepening: the watchers shift from mystery to lighthouse of doom. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. peace—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one sustained tightening: Aris’s historical parallels incrementally collapse Elara’s justification until the single reversal of surrender. Cost is legible in the “quiet, resigned click.” Agency remains with Elara; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve drowned memories—signaled early and tightened when the inkwell is nearly lost. One meaningful escalation: rogue current → loss → frantic wrest → recovery, forcing a crystallized stance. Cost is visceral: scraped knuckles, burning lungs, lifelong solitude. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncover honest origin—is signaled early and tightened once: the blackout strips away official light, forcing a literal re-reading. The cost is the lifelong, solitary labor Elias accepts in the final beat. Agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—shape grief or be consumed—tightens through each mnemonic wave. The polishing ritual is the escalating micro-choice that converts raw sorrow into workable form; cost is the reopened wound of the dream’s promise. One clear deepening suffices; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—locate the reservoir of stolen potential—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates under causal pressure. The tightening beat is the spike in the quantum foam that forecloses doubt and forces the final stance. Cost is visible: the grief remains a “cold, dense star” now aimed. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the signal or remain alone—is signaled early and tightened by each beat: chip insertion, drone ascent, physical strain to pull. The final beam forecloses the option of ignorance; cost is the irrevocable shift from seeker to participant. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Anya’s fate—tightens when the void proves she was unmade, not dead. Escalation is causal: each sifted log raises stakes until the gouge delivers the irreversible truth. Cost is palpable: Elias’s prior craft is weaponized against him, forcing a lifelong reversal of practice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will the exchange succeed without fresh betrayal—tightens once: the click of the lockbox forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in Elias’s tremoring grip and the boy’s shiver. Agency is shared yet weighted toward Elias’s micro-choice to trust the relic. No escalation beyond this single beat, but the pressure is sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling heart and action—tightens when the compass shifts from judge to offering. One meaningful escalation: the shift from walking away to stepping toward the water narrows options and forces a stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the “flickering faith” and the broken tool held over the darkening sea.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he rekindle empathy after obliteration?—is signaled early and tightened once: the letter forces the shift from uncovering the past to building a future. Cost is felt in the letter’s raw despair and the irreversible procedure. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reforge the bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightened by each spice-scented breath. The final fusion forecloses return to human form; the price is irreversible. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Escalation is steady, not spectacular, but the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and tightened when she realizes it cannot be found. The single deepening (letting go) narrows her options and carries visible cost: the relinquished cloak and the new linen vow. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens through each photograph’s integration; the cost is the unbearable weight of every grief accepted. Agency is renunciation rather than assault, and the final lightness is the earned reversal. One tightening beat per photograph suffices; no slack loops.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—escalates through accumulating textures rather than reversals; the release of light tightens the pattern and incurs the cost of empty bottles and altered mountain. One clear intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transfer control without blood—signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: each click of the quill holder narrows options until the fort’s lights speak a new language. Cost is conceptual (irreversible betrayal of the old order) and felt in Kael’s white knuckles. No reversals needed; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the spiral, keep the promise—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is causal: vision tightens, tide rises, choice narrows to star dust. Cost is visible: Kael’s slumped knees, eels’ panic, the unbroken curse. No extraneous reversals; one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs facing scars—tightens when the envelope’s contents convert contemplation into action. The timer’s hour is the single meaningful intensification; its ping narrows options from stasis to departure. Cost is the forfeiture of safe isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Predetermined vs free-will stakes sharpen with every parry: the unpainted future hours narrow possibilities until the seam click forecloses unchosen paths. A visible cost (missed moves, gained evidence) locks the philosophical payoff to physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    A single dominant stake—beauty from decay—is articulated early and tightens when two silhouettes appear. The pressure remains situational, communal, low-threat; the absence of explicit antagonism prevents deeper escalation, yet the shared cost of continued sorting carries enough weight to narrow future options.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reversing fate’s separation—is signaled early and tightened by the flickering compasses and approaching night. One decisive escalation: translating film flaws into music that rends reality. Cost is legible in the irrevocable step through the white rectangle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cultural memory erasure—tightens as monsoon countdown forces the interpretive leap. One clear escalation: shift from analytical mapping to embodied singing. Cost legible in the transformed doubt she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: diffuse concentrated guilt or drown in it. Pressure tightens once: wind turns against tide, compass steadies, Kenji must act. The diffusion is irreversible and costly—memories lose their “brutal concentration.” Agency is internal yet decisive; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence (wind shift) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single deepening (orchid water feeding weed) narrows options under Accumulative lens, making detachment impossible. Cost is unmistakable in the visceral "shattering" of detachment and final shovel decision.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Kaelen's agency: dawn observations deepen knowledge, narrowing options to retracing the path. Cost is unmistakable—physical endurance of pre-sun colds forecloses hiding from fire, reshaping her kiln relighting as reclamation, not regression.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen organically through sensory escalation: trauma intrusion raises cost, but "rectify the world’s silence" remains slightly abstract. Agency is clear (weaving colors), yet the dominant stake could feel more viscerally threatened pre-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (ending psychic noise) tightens via lens installation, narrowing options to a single decisive act under Accumulative lens. Agency is clear but constrained—Elias’s "folding the world" choice alters tactics with cost in "thousand silent screams." Escalation lacks one visible price paid mid-beat (e.g., physical toll during traversal), slightly muddying cost legibility despite strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—donations evolve from sustenance to seeds/tools, driven by her bell declaration. Cost is felt in elders’ soil-starved hands, narrowing options toward intergenerational repair.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (love's storage) tightens through breathing cycles: inhale reveals pain, exhale dissolves it into the answer. Agency-driven deepening as Elara syncs breath to "phantom pulse," narrowing options to one transformative exhale. Cost crystallizes in the shift from "void" to "resonance" without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving identity against memory loss) signaled by "frayed pathways of his recall." Escalation through intensifying sensory degradation (sepia edges ghosting → wife's face as static). Agency in fragment destruction narrows options to irreversible erasure. Cost is visceral: "no name" after the torrent of moments. Single tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single tightening—pouring absences—narrows options decisively under Accumulative lens. Cost ("grinding glass and tearing silk") is unmistakable and shapes the cellular mending payoff. Agency pure: Elias's choices drive every escalation beat without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her choice to continue working despite warnings tightens the noose. Cost is unmistakable—the abandoned sphere and shattered purpose reweight stakes under the causal lens, with the structural failure narrowing options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven purely by Leo's agency under causal lens—decrypting cast directly triggers failsafe—but vulnerability motivation isn't dramatized through conflicting choices during pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten as the star fades, narrowing Kaelen’s window to chart darkness; cost is visceral in "dying embers" and dissolving star. Escalation via deepening silence textures works under Accumulative lens, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven agency beyond receptive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency (looped strategy evolution) with unmistakable cost (irreversible loop break). "Cold of courtyard/ice became one" crystallizes stakes reweighting under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (mistrust) signaled early; escalation via ticket accumulation narrows options to park confrontation. Cost legible in "thaw" description, but Elias' decision to follow feels slightly convenient—pressure could deepen before turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes signaled early (solstice deadline); escalation via Elias's quiet preparation vs. metrics-driven opposition. Cost legible in marble ritual under Accumulative lens. Agency-driven deepening as garden's response validates his method, narrowing options to conceptual victory.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (proving lateral time) tightens via lever pull’s irreversible action; cost is Elias’s re-calibrated soul. Agency-driven escalation lacks only one visible loss (e.g., stamina or tool) to hit 9.0 band, though conceptual cost remains undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (deciphering ghost's code) tightens through Elias's agency: disrupting water's stillness creates irreversible cost (ruined program). Escalation driven by his realization that "spirit was in the water itself" forecloses passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: examining the smudged note deepens the dominant stake (resolving ambiguity) into realizing she *needs* uncertainty. The tightening—foreclosing certainty—carries visible cost in the "clean, high-altitude ache." Pressure grows via Accumulative lens through sensory/emotional density, narrowing options to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes signaled immediately via "collective gravity unmooring" mind; Aeridor chronicle deepens pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost legible through temporary renewal ("peace would crumble again"), though escalation lacks one visible tradeoff during transition.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through eclipse progression into a single, earned deepening where Lena's choice to "link" reweights grief; cost is visible in her physical transformation from brittle posture to fragile smile.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (cause of hollowing) tightens through diary revelations, but pressure lacks protagonist agency—Kaelen merely receives knowledge. Cost is conceptual (irretrievable loss) but not viscerally dramatized in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via fog/thickening action; Elias' agency in crafting cookies drives escalation, but cost of his life's work resolving feels slightly understated beyond the departure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (beating exhaustion to find the keynote) tightens through memory mapping's density increase. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the dawn-triggered climax, with cost unmistakable in "energy guttered out"—though physical toll could heighten visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate via density of failed cycles ("shadows creeping higher"), but the core pressure—conquering the labyrinth through memory acceptance—lacks a visible tactical cost beyond internal resolution, slightly blurring the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through vibration density toward the resonant thrumming; cost is unmistakable in the seasonal shift from "ending" to "hopeful intake," driven entirely by Elara's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate causally from "prickling on his neck" to the pigeon’s arrival, culminating in Elias sacrificing solitude for truth; the cost—"restore the integrity of his solitude"—is unmistakable in the final line’s "whetstone" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is flawless: scent-triggered grief stake tightens as Moon-Phlox opens, forcing Elias to confront memories. Cost unmistakable in "profound, cleansing sorrow" foreclosing his avoidance path—agency drives the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation driven purely by Elias’s agency in uncovering pattern layers, yet the cost ("decaying vessel") remains abstractly stated rather than viscerally felt in the final beat, diluting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.6)
    Single dominant stake (can beauty exist in silence?) tightens via agency: her arpeggio "waking something" forces stance crystallization. Cost—physical exhaustion and emotional completion—is visible when "last note faded" amid resonant silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Kael's agency as he separates charges, with the cost ("cold, dense stone" in chest) visibly altering his final action; one tightening suffices but the sorrow's weight could narrow options more acutely.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (honoring silent contributors) tightens via Elias’s agency: his "emotional risk" calculation drives the envelope reveal. Cost legible in Alina’s stunned tears; single escalation suffices for length. David’s legacy deepens thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (belonging vs. isolation) tightens via search discovery, but cost of joining lacks visceral weight; "nervous rhythm" shows tension yet resolution’s warmth undersells the "luminescent ache’s" prior severity under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency under Accumulative lens: disrupted cadence narrows options to restoring rhythm via borrowed time, with felt cost in the "terrifying silence" of interrupted pattern. Stakes tighten through water's evolving states (rapids/syrup) without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (quantifying ambiguous loss) tightens when lattice emerges, narrowing options from seeking to acceptance. Agency-driven escalation—Elian’s channeling transforms jagged pain into smoothed geometry—with cost legible in "void now has a name" foreclosing desperate search.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (preserving erased lineage) tighten through Elias’s agency: tape retrieval under grid failure forces precise timing. Cost is visceral in Anya’s "choked gasp" and Elias’s fulfilled purpose, reweighting the dominant stake via Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: failed repair attempt narrows options, leaf discovery deepens knowledge; cost legible in "amputation" metaphor and physical tension release during saw retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten when Elias chooses story over object ("An exchange, then"), foreclosing keeping brooch. Cost is visceral through weight metaphor; agency drives escalation under accumulative lens though conflict resolution borders on clean.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten via the cave’s "steadily unpredictable" behavior forcing Lyra’s scrying failure and shadow-driven realization; cost (lost clairvoyance) visibly alters her final state under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate via Kaelen's agency: mundane finds → valve's emotional charge → woman proving fragments rebuild meaning. Cost crystallizes in "panicked breath" echo and "failed heroism" with no convenient resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (truth about mentor) tightens through vault revelations; Elias's agency in interpreting star-schematics escalates pressure; cost of guardianship legible in "profound calm settling over trembling heart".

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (sculpting memory sanctuary) tightens via storm’s sensory pressure narrowing options to whale/star conversion. Cost legible in skepticism’s dissolution; agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens makes "profound acceptance" feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency as Xylos manipulates magnetic fields, narrowing options to a single irreversible step; cost is unmistakable in the sanctuary's unmaking, though the "spatial mutiny" concept could deepen tactics earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (fighting silence through invented histories) signaled early, but escalation lacks tangible cost. Sunrise tightens pressure via lamp hum, yet success is effortless—no trade-off (e.g., exhaustion, resource loss) to heighten the Aquacade capture.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake escalation driven by accumulating fragments rather than protagonist agency weakens tightening under Accumulative lens; the woman's story arrives coincidentally rather than through active pursuit, diluting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elias' agency: tuning peg adjustments narrow options to precise frequency, with "trembling arm" revealing physical cost. Dominant stake ("decode riddle") tightens via resonant hums, making "gloomy cheerfulness" an undeniable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Kael's agency: inspector's early arrival tests coded system, narrowing options to endurance. Cost unmistakable in inspector's "confusion" and "data-slate full of contradictions," reweighting survival stakes. One deepening (graffiti efficiency) suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (capturing the bloom before extinction) tightens via the "dawning hush" as Kepler-186 grazes the horizon. Protagonist’s endurance forecloses the path of delay; cost is visceral in the sublimation moment where "delicate structures vanish," altering his purpose from witness to keeper of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Time pressure escalates via horn blasts (narrowing options), but cost remains physical/emotional without deeper trade-off; agency in repair forecloses failure path with visible exhaustion cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single tightening via atmospheric plunge narrows options to witness-only; conceptual cost (life’s work invalidated) legible in "a joke told by the universe." Agency shifts from seeking place to documenting phenomenon under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (shared balance) tighten via accumulating footfalls narrowing options to pure endurance. Cost ("walked for hours") is felt but insufficiently embodied; the conceptual price needs sharper physical manifestation to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake (capture pure silence vs. survival) escalates through Accumulative/Textural pressure: oxygen alarm strobes as psychic storm intensifies. Protagonist’s agency—overriding instinct to "search for a current"—narrowing options with visible cost (death). Cost proof: "power reserves flatlined" directly links to closure’s calm.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (proving truth against inherited disbelief) tightens via coast guard’s approach, but timeframe lacks tactical urgency; protagonist’s agency in breaking the seal narrows options decisively. Cost legible in inevitable dismissal of his story.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (debt repayment) tightens through bloom's crescendo, but Lyra's agency drives escalation rather than Elian's choices. Cost ("sorrowful splendor" dissolving) is legible, yet protagonist's endurance lacks active trade-offs under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate coherently under accumulative lens: preserving the tapestry shifts from passive sleepwalking to active defense against the storm. Kaelen’s agency drives the tightening—using wharf-weaving skills to secure threads—foreclosing escape with visceral cost (bleeding hands). The storm’s threat reweights options, but the blue thread’s origin slightly weakens pressure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (secure identity transmission) signaled early, but pressure never tightens—no complication tests the method (e.g., wind smudging chalk, drone proximity). For Accumulative lens, density fails to intensify; cost remains abstract despite the "fragile timeframe" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through intuitive pattern-weaving ("discordant notes" to "terrifying image"), but cost legibility falters; "window closing" feels abstract without physical/emotional toll like trembling hands or sacrificed item.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via condensation messages narrowing Kael’s options to painful truth, with felt cost in Elara’s hollowed state and Kael’s "shattering understanding."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Elias' agency: decoding symbols transforms abstract "shared anxieties" into visceral stakes ("fear of thunder" mirrors General's pain). Cost is unmistakable—the swallowed motion shows foreclosed path—but lacks one more tightening beat before climax to hit 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as light-density intensifies under fog pressure. The fragment's use narrows options from "frustration" to "coaxing," with visible cost in traded permanence for "pensive mirth."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' escalating coin experiments, culminating in the seven-structure sequence that forces irreversible trade: cerulean certainty for resonant uncertainty. Cost is visible in his abandonment of predictable craft.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Kaelen's agency ("stop whispering/start screaming") forecloses options with trade-off cost ("wipe consciousness" vs. "moment to *be*"). Stakes feel slightly abstract despite conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (longing vs. creation) tightens meaningfully through Elara’s agency in reinterpreting pain. Cost is legible but lacks visceral on-page manifestation during the pivotal shift; the "sand grinding into pearl" metaphor feels slightly abstract for required pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (preserve trust before extinction) tightens through Elian's pitch-chasing, with visible cost in "foxglove regret." Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens, but the single deepening lacks the microscopic trade-off nuance expected at 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen via "thousand unspoken fears" and blood sacrifice, with escalation driven by Kaelen’s glyph-writing agency. Cost is unmistakable in his vulnerability and Elara’s guarded pain.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when pollen/azurite transform the envelope into a map, narrowing options to a single path. Cost is legible in Kaelen’s physical tremor and the father’s sacrificed safety—but the volcano’s groan slightly edges into coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (preserving music vs. sharing it) tightens under Accumulative lens when rain threatens compositions. Elias' agency—scrambling to save sheets, then confessing—narrows options with felt cost: the withering "made space for blooming."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through logbook decoding, but escalation leans on forecasted threshold rather than protagonist agency; conceptual cost (necessary distance) lacks tangible on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sunrise deadline tightens stakes credibly, but escalation falters—Kaelen's plan succeeds via coincidental jellyfish migration rather than his agency. Cost legible in feather's reweighted meaning, yet "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" principle violated at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten via Accumulative escalation (fading turquoise light, receding vines), but protagonist agency feels passive—conjecture arises from intuition rather than decisive choice under pressure. Cost (memory loss) is legible but not actively fought.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (imposing order on chaos) tightens via Kael's coin placement, with escalation driven by protagonist agency. Conceptual cost—beauty's fragility—is legible in the fading light and resumed tide, though physical stakes lack visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (memory as disease vs. cosmic testament) tighten through protagonist’s agency: failed dance attempts deepen knowledge until gap-observation shifts pressure. Cost is legible in "permanent piece of cosmos made manifest"—fledging forecloses his old exile state with visible physical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen via sensory pattern shifts (gulls, salt) under textural lens; cost crystallized in the atrium's final rainbow dissolution as irreversible loss foreclosing preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake ("what it costs") tightens through Elias's choice to shield the box, narrowing options to "naive perfection" vs. "cracked reality."

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stake (deciphering the wall’s "dream") tightens through textural accumulation: hum resolves into pacing/arguments. Renunciation cost ("not hers to carry") is palpable. Agency in leaving negative deepens rather than resolves, fitting Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (ephemeral hope vs. inevitable return to reality) tighten through the bell's approach, narrowing options to a single decisive moment; cost is legible in the "ghost of possibility" lingering behind glass after reflections normalize, though pressure lacks active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure escalates through ritual density (dust sigil deepening symbolic weight), narrowing options to the signing moment; cost is visceral in Kaelen's "trembling" hand and Vorlag's surrendered "jagged signature" foreclosing war's path.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single deepening (egg dissolving) reweights stakes through Elias' agency: "preserve the echo" transforms from abstract desire to microbial surrender. Thunder's return as "promise of rain that was both his creation and curse" makes conceptual cost unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: each knot untangled narrows Elara’s options until the judge’s regret demands the final release. Cost is visceral—the sigh releasing "immense burden"—and the light wave’s return of truths forecloses the city’s path of denial.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten when the "sparse, hesitant trickle" of butterflies arrives, forcing Elias into accelerated action ("hands a blur"). Cost is visceral in the "fragile chain linking his signals"—agency lies in honoring loss, not preventing it.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as texture intensifies (holes→weave→light→sigil), but dominant conflict (sound preservation) lacks concrete on-page test—no moment where success/failure hangs in balance despite technical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve cylinder/understand path) tightens via storm’s pressure, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost is legible in "water swirled around his ankles" as Kael embraces dissolution, though physical peril and conceptual shift could interweave more tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes signaled early ("seal covenant with unknown") and pressure accumulates via ritual precision. Cost is unmistakable in dismantling—foreclosing public recognition. Interregnum timeframe ("terrestrial chaos") creates live clock narrowing his window.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (recreating stolen dream) tighten through breath-controlled frost formation; escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in the mountains' shattering ("fracture line... spider's thread") and her tear.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through knowledge shift: fracture transforms from "wound" to "germination space" via seed insertion. Cost is legible in physical reactions ("air knocked from chest") and irreversible action (leaving ribbon). Dominant stake (mending vs. allowing change) signaled by paragraph 2.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (understanding temporal paradox) tightens through Accumulative lens: headache pressure and cameo's "hum" escalate to bathroom breakthrough. Cost legible in "dizzying loop" and "low thrum" transformed; agency lies in inquiry method forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency (research → map → negotiation) under Situational lens. Stakes viscerally felt through "future burns" metaphor; cost unmistakable in final image's weight and symphony shift. No visible loss prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: discouragement → knot discovery → pattern realization. Cost legible in "smile for first time in months," but "defy gravity of hopelessness" slightly abstracts the dominant stake’s visceral weight at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (suffocation vs. infinite safety) tightens via gravity inversion’s time pressure. Agency-driven escalation: Elian’s ascent battle ("contracted muscles fighting instinct") narrows options to endure openness, with cost legible in descent’s "shield of perspective." Single deepening sufficient at length.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via sensory accumulation (train ghost, light striking prism) deepens the dominant stake—silence as threat vs. comfort—with Elian’s agency driving her shift. Cost is unmistakable: her "panicked rhythm" to "deepened" breath forecloses fear. One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sunrise deadline creates tangible pressure; peeling layers escalates cost through historical failures. Agency lies in methodical layer removal (not combat), narrowing options to the prime layer. Minor deduction: time’s passage affects orchard light but not Elara’s physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency: pressing iron to scar narrows options from "fading threshold" to "conduit". Cost is visceral in Liam's "stiff from disuse" lungs – a felt price that alters tactics (breathing as active relearning).

Single meaningful deepening (focus vs wall) forecloses overseers’ brute-force path decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through escalating reality shifts ("air grew thin," "heart-stopping second" of night pressing in), narrowing options to one precise action. Cost is visceral: program's dust and severed clasp make renewal legible, with Kaelen's "shivering bliss" embodying earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (unfurling paper reveals button), reweighting "magnify small kindnesses" with felt cost. Escalation lacks visceral stakes progression; sorrow-to-hope shift remains abstract despite chest-ache embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency through the puddle-map navigation, tightening options as city surveillance gives way to toxic marshes; cost ("heart hammered") feels earned though slightly muted, but the lagoon's sacred stillness reweights stakes decisively under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding the message) tightens through the speck’s arrival, narrowing options to the prod—a choice with immediate, visible cost (ash flaking, moss glowing).

Agency remains protagonist-driven but lacks visible tactical adaptation beyond the singular unfastening act.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.6)

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten causally through the whisper's destabilization, but the rupture's cost feels conceptual rather than embodied; Operator's calm after cosmic dissolution undermines visceral tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the squall's visible time transforms from atmospheric threat to revelation catalyst, narrowing Kaelen's options from defensive ritual (covering mirrors) to active interpretation.

    Dominant stake (apology before destruction) signaled immediately. Escalation via Accumulative lens: hum intensifies, notes shimmer, scent blooms—each beat narrowing emotional options.

    Dominant stake (helping strangers pass on) tightens via Kael's agency in the button-press, narrowing options to one irreversible choice. Cost is legible in exhaustion and emotional release, though escalation lacks a visible pre-climax trade-off.

    Stakes tighten through storm escalation (density increase) with visible cost (exhaustion, unintended prophecies), but conflict lacks visceral trade-offs—Kaelan's physical strain outweighs the abstract conceptual cost of misinterpreted art, slightly muting the dominant stake's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    One meaningful deepening (light behavior observations) narrows options to systematic tracking; cost is irreversible perceptual shift, though stakes lack visceral friction despite intellectual agency driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten texturally: shard’s "internal misery" → sorrow-meter spike → moonlight transformation. Cost is visceral in the shard’s shift from "weeping tragic story" to "neutral warmth," reweighting grief’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (preserving vow's essence) signaled immediately; pressure tightens as light frays, narrowing options to one frequency capture. Cost unmistakable in dead slide and "Extinguished" casket. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preventing fob sale) tightens via three false starts, each narrowing options. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: chaos attempt → invoking truce → direct bid → exposing flaw. Cost is legible in Silas’s "paled" panic and Eva’s "snarl," but the sunrise deadline’s pressure isn’t tracked concretely enough to justify 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres through Elara’s escalating sensory evidence (coppery tang → merged storms), narrowing options to acceptance. The aurora’s intervention reweights the stake with conceptual cost: her hypothesis becomes a "map written in lightning," foreclosing the "fixing people" path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by agency: reinterpretation of painting shifts tactics from force to finesse, narrowing options via light-sequence manipulation; "auroral sorrow" crystallizes stakes with tear's visible cost under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (truth vs. societal decay) tighten through map reconstruction, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the postal plate's discovery feels coincidental rather than earned agency, weakening the cost's causal weight despite resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (preserving wonder) tighten through the sculpture's construction and inevitable melting, with visible cost in the vapor. Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under Accumulative lens, though pressure lacks a mid-scene reversal beyond the wind's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (human connection vs. bureaucratic violence) escalates purely through Elias’s accumulation of memories. Cost is visceral in the final image: the garden funding transforms abstract "listening heals" into tangible, communal rebirth with felt social price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation through density (recursive cipher) deepens stakes effectively, but dice resolution relies on chance rather than protagonist agency narrowing options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaim memories) tightens through ritual escalation; cost is visceral when memory vanishes immediately. Agency in "pushing past chilling pressure" forecloses easy hope. "Fluctuates mysteriously" trait creates trade-off: proximity enables contact but guarantees loss.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through silence expansion under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual ("fragile blanket") without visceral physical or relational price. Agency drives pressure, yet cost lacks the felt immediacy required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. comforting illusions) tightens through Clara’s seal-aided perception shift: "curdle into need for truth" forces rooftop confrontation. Agency-driven escalation culminates in her asking "what are you?" with visible cost—shattered sanctuary ("agreed upon lies") for deeper responsibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake (archive memory vs. safe isolation) tightens through Accumulative deepening as whispers coalesce to full vision. Cost crystallizes in "ghost of her hand slipping" versus severing connection, though "independence wasn't safety" risks thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through Kaelen’s agency: the unbroken line’s modification forecloses war with visible cost (trembling → peace). Escalation via Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (drips, ink viscosity) narrows options toward the pinprick.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when seashell clarifies "Unfinished," narrowing options toward crystal resolution. Cost legible in tear and purpose shift, but escalation lacks sufficient protagonist-driven pressure spikes for 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: gathering dream cameos (pressure) tightens into creating the shared dreamscape (deepening), narrowing options to exposure. Cost is visible in the murderer’s dissolution and the boy’s final smile—a felt trade-off that reweights "salvage" as release, not retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: firefly observation deepens to active participation (whistle), narrowing options to acceptance; cost legible in "no disappointment" after failed harmony, reweighting stakes through quiet endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (truth vs. protective myth) tighten through Kaelen’s agency: reassembling letters deepens knowledge, the intuition moment forecloses reliance on pure logic. Conceptual cost lands but lacks visible trade-off; wish for subtle hesitation about destroying the lie’s comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten coherently under Hybrid lens: Great Storm forces stance crystallization between shadow prophecies. Cost is felt (end of blue world) but not visibly paid; sun's appearance shows success without clear forfeiture beyond abstract "weight of nascent world."

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "sweeten its profound silence" drives sound collection, narrowing options to a single symphonic solution; cost crystallizes in "fleeting, beautiful resonance" redefining his existence with felt conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes escalate causally from hum’s intensification to tower-shuddering dissonance, narrowing options to vibrational mirroring. Cost is unmistakable in physical toll and "hollow relief"—agency reweights protection as integration, not destruction, with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation is pure protagonist agency: months of observation narrow to Lyra’s meridian approach, forcing the "quiet click" with immediate cost (hum vanishing). Dominant stake ("patient revolution") tightens meaningfully as the chronometer ticks. Only flaw: "wildness" could manifest more actively during the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (truth vs bureaucratic convenience) tightens when Elias finds the notebook, foreclosing Fletcher's theory. Cost is visible in professional defiance. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though Finch's obsession feels slightly external until journal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (deserving forgiveness) tighten through Elias's metaphor, but Arthur's realization lacks visible price—guilt dissipates without enduring cost. Meets escalation minimum via textural density shift, but band guardrail denies 8.8+ for cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (proving Yearning Algorithm) tightens through glyph realization to flight test. Agency-driven escalation: 'Grip' command forces wing redesign altering tactics. Cost legible in isolation and physical risk—'fuming acid' proximity reweights victory as bittersweet.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (truth vs corporate cover-up) tightens through Elara's agency—her pattern recognition drives escalation. Kael's confrontation narrows options credibly, but the supervisor's sudden appearance slightly softens causal pressure; cost remains conceptual not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (community fracture) tightens through Kael’s agency: his investigation forecloses accusation by revealing the accident’s truth. Cost is Mara’s emotional exhaustion, visible in her physical collapse. Pressure grows coherently under Causal lens—no coincidence resolves the conflict, only earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (learning endings’ sound) tightens through Elara’s agency—trawling debris, enduring "taut humming wire" patience—until ice-calving reweights options. Cost is unmistakable: her comprehension ("That was the sound") forecloses searching, with calm as earned renunciation. Escalation driven entirely by protagonist under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s vineyard epiphany: his realization that love was "planted in the wrong garden" forecloses bitterness with cost in the letter’s physical fragility. Agency drives escalation, but pressure lacks one visceral price beyond emotional shift (e.g., tangible loss).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through Kael's agency: disciple's distortion catalyzes departure, dune descent tightens options toward consecration. Cost legible in "leaving no trace"—sacrificing presence for truth's purity under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (community healing) signaled early but pressure lacks tangible complication; escalation relies on photo accumulation alone. Cost legible via Elias's departure yet personal sacrifice remains abstract, limiting deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s deepening auditory immersion: the crystal’s "fractured sequences" evolve from curiosity to revelation, narrowing options until testimony becomes the only path. Cost is legible in abandoning written legacy ("cage it in the very finality... would be the ultimate failure").

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: misreading driftwood markers forces adaptation, culminating in the chalk circle’s irreversible choice. The hum’s intensification reweights "capture" into surrender, with cost (permanent forgetting) crystallized in the dissolving symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Elias' agency under the Causal lens: vibrations intensify to a "violent crescendo" (window crack), forcing the lens sacrifice. The dominant stake (stop the clock or station collapses) tightens to a single choice with felt cost—eternal stasis—legible in the final image. No coincidence resolution; pressure narrows options to one irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—procuring the turntable, brewing tea—not coincidence. Cost is undeniable (death), but Lena’s resistance resolves too cleanly; the decade of pain lacks felt escalation in her shift from "clipped words" to touch.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency: relearning "inversion" to "inside out" narrows options from weeks of study to the key’s paradoxical alignment.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens through density accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency under Accumulative lens: his digging intensifies pressure, narrowing options from doubt to irreversible fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes signaled immediately ("share light without fire"); polishing process drives meaningful deepening where each stroke narrows options. Cost legible in "erasing lines of concentration" and rejection of fire's legacy, perfectly aligned with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (Kaelen’s fossilized identity) tightens via drip-pattern revelation, narrowing options to acceptance or endurance. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency (proffering pendant), with cost legible in his shifted breathing. Single deepening suffices; coincidence doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes remain abstract ("world held its breath") despite visceral execution; the child's danger isn't felt through Kaelen's actions. Escalation via starlight pouring succeeds, but dominant stake lacks concrete on-page test beyond the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (preserving wonder against monochrome silence) deepen through light-study accumulation, but pressure lacks tangible setbacks. Cost legible in "days bled into weeks" yet escalation feels too frictionless for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief) signaled immediately. Single deepening—the calcification process—narrowing Kaelen's options through precise alignment. Cost legible in enduring solitude ("listening to the thawing world"), though snowmelt timeframe only subtly pressures tactics. Agency consistent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (containing essence vs. grief's totality) tightens through memory crystallization, narrowing options to one "usable part"; cost legible in effort of carving and "rust-hued peace" as earned compromise, though escalation lacks deeper tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (confronting hubris) tightens via camera wheel discovery, forcing memory that narrows options to acceptance. Protagonist agency drives escalation ("It was my fault"), with visible cost in dissolved arrogance. No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency—redirecting carnival generators to bypass dead power cores narrows options to a single high-stakes act. Cost is visceral: the "groaning generators" and "taut cables" preceding silence make the star chart's glow feel earned, though the carnival's role as resource supplier lacks earlier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (making peace with the dream) tightens through Elias’s arduous portage and "excruciatingly gentle" movements. The cost—"twenty years of crushing weight transformed"—is viscerally legible in the final image, driven entirely by his agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten causally as radio static ceases coinciding with discovery, forcing crystallization of Kael's stance; the felt cost of "salvaging history" reshapes his foundation without soft resets, though escalation relies slightly on coincidence (hook catching).

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving knowledge) signaled early, but fog's pressure lacks meaningful escalation—it merely enables the insight rather than forcing adaptation. No narrowing of options beyond the three-day struggle mentioned in passing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Kaelen's projection (agency: choosing to feel Elara's grief), narrowing options to writing as healing. Cost legible in physical chill intensifying post-revelation; Accumulative escalation via sensory density reweights "geography of healing" without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Kaelen's hypothesizing (temperature/pulse doubts), narrowing options to the hatch moment. Cost—centuries of mechanical monotony interrupted—is viscerally felt when pistons "softened their hydraulic hiss."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (rewriting inheritance) tightens via grafting act, narrowing options to one irreversible choice. Agency-driven escalation: her "unyielding compassion" forces focus on the tree despite perimeter firefighting. Cost is visible in abandoned coin and soot-smudged endurance, though cloud timeframe lacks causal pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative pressure: the geese's pause creates a live clock tightening tactics, and the box's rotation narrows options to a single decisive turn. Conceptual cost ("collective relief") is legible, but the memory-liberation goal remains slightly abstract until payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through Xylar's method shift—from mapping sorrow to broadcasting light—narrowing options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible in releasing the gear, though "approximates infinity" lacks on-page constraint affecting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding collective grief) tightens meaningfully during storm’s arrival, narrowing focus to the nexus point. Cost is legible ("thundering quieted"), but butterfly migration timeframe functions as atmospheric motif rather than live clock altering tactics under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through ritual escalation: "hardest part... letting go" forces trade-off between containment and balance. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens—each inscription intensifies weight until release. Agency slightly muted; ritual feels predetermined rather than actively chosen under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Decoding pressure tightens through Elias' agency ("surge of frantic hope" to map discovery), narrowing options via the silver thread. Cost is legible in "crushing weight of a journey never completed" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation via sensory density (static → melody → blazing text) deepens under Accumulative lens. Cost ("clenching fear") is felt but slightly abstract; one physical tremor during broadcast would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (temporary peace vs inevitable grief return) tightens through Elara's curated omissions. Kael's urn tilt is agency-driven under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in Elara's "heavy, knowing stone" heart as he scatters ash.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Elias’ agency: realizing "method was wrong" shifts tactics to subtraction. Cost is legible in "fragile calm" and "wavering yet whole" hum—resentments carved away with felt relational cost—but tightening lacks one visible tradeoff beyond emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating pruned memories reweighting trauma, narrowing options via sensory density; cost is unmistakable in ongoing labor ("seeds... would be planted"), driven purely by Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (restoring vibrancy vs. sterile pragmatism) tightens through Silas's agency: refusing data for poetry forces Lena's deepening realization. Conceptual cost—"routine became a tomb"—is undeniable in the bio-mechanical revelation. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens via riddle's escalating density.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her white-cube act deepens knowledge (the "inadvertently profound" realization), narrowing options from object-placement to human awakening. Cost is visceral (heart "hammering") and conceptual (sterility's spread). Flaw: the flamingo moment edges toward coincidence, but mat-swap precedent earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency as the "structural weakness" misconception collapses into the "gill" revelation, forcing a trade-off with visible cost (burying the ampoule); escalation via Accumulative/Textural density shift narrowly avoids feeling rushed by anchoring each revelation in concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven purely by Elias' agency: rigging spotlights forecloses retreat, making silence's "familiar ache of doubt" a visceral cost. Stakes crystallize through one tightening (display → response) under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten via Alistair's agency: council resignation → sonic resonance insight → guiding pitch ("Higher!"). Cost is visceral ("frozen stiff hands"), but beekeeper timeframe lacks live-clock pressure, slightly diluting escalation's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Agency in lever pull forecloses normal existence; cost visible in bodily dissolution ("knuckles softening"). Tide recession tightens temporal pressure, narrowing options to irreversible action under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate through sensory density: luminance shifts from "ghosts of sugar" to "cleansing fire." Protagonist's agency in baiting Fear ("give the monster what it wants") drives conceptual reversal. Cost unmistakable in "truer emptiness" reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Storm pressure escalates via Kai's agency (drawing, striking) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to rhythmic adaptation; cost legibility suffers slightly as emotional/physical toll remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized during peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (deciphering the warning) escalates through Kaelen’s pattern realizations; agency-driven deepening (translating light to sound) forecloses hope with visceral cost in the crystallized "ordained extinction" certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten via Ashworth historical parallel (single causal escalation) forcing Elara’s trade-off: curated peace vs structural weakness. Cost legible in "resigned click" and document transfer. Agency-driven under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (preserving memory against time) tightened through protagonist’s agency: inkwell retrieval forecloses path of loss. Cost (physical injury, emotional risk) visibly alters sealing ritual’s "fierce tenderness," reweighting options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (truth vs sanitized history) tightens through knowledge deepening when the stamp matches the mark, foreclosing Elias' prior assumptions. Conceptual cost ("ugly truth... clarifying calm") is unmistakable, but lacks a visible price altering tactics—his resolve shifts stance without practical consequence, capping escalation per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens—each memory wave narrows Kaelen's options through sensory overload—drives agency to the gem-polishing climax. Cost is unmistakable in "knuckles white" during ascent and the dream's "achingly beautiful" broken promise.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten relentlessly under accumulative lens: coolant diagnostic and breaker reset narrow options, forcing equation refinement. Agency clear in "feeding echo of loss as tangible force," with conceptual cost (grief redirected but not resolved) legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding belonging) tightens through Elara's agency: navigating star trails under pressure forecloses her isolation with visible emotional cost. Single escalation suffices, though physical strain could deepen cost earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) tightens via driftwood discovery, narrowing options to memory restoration. Cost legible in Elias’s transformed guilt, but the “withheld truth” escalation lacks one visceral price paid mid-scene to fully satisfy 9.0’s cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (healing "fresh wounds" via exchange) tightens through Elias's agency under Accumulative lens. The untethering narrows options with visible cost (unresolved forgiveness), though Kaelen's role slightly passive in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (aligning heart/action) tightens through kayakers' laughter intensifying Elias' pull toward water. Agency in facing sea—foreclosing land-bound penance—with visceral cost ("phantom spray," "flickering candle" faith).

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (kindling empathy) tightens through protagonist’s agency: ignoring coordinates would maintain sterile peace, but descent forecloses that path. Cost is unmistakable—"grey numbness" pierced by "fragile spark"—though "desert of ash" metaphor slightly abstracts early stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as Elian's resistance crumbles under ritual pressure, but the cost of metamorphosis feels slightly abstract; the physical pain subsiding too neatly into peace softens the visceral impact of losing his human form.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (recovering lost time) deepens via Accumulative lens—sensory density (ozone, phosphorescent moss) reweights time as "vapor" with felt cost. Agency shines in her decision to trace the hand, though "vapor" insight borders on telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen via Accumulative escalation: each photo’s sorrow narrows options toward the childhood image, where her own desolation threatens annihilation; cost is visceral in the ship’s shuddering and her bodily dissolution, though early dimension stakes could tighten faster.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through celestial alignment intensifying pressure on Kael's quest; cost (sacrificing fireflies) visibly alters tactics, but prophecy coincidence slightly dilutes protagonist agency in resolution despite firefly release being causal.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    Blackout tightens tactics by creating cover for Kael’s action; one meaningful escalation (turning quill → light signals → system shifts) forecloses Warden’s authority with felt cost. Stake crystallization is pure protagonist agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Kael's agency: vision compels star dust use, creating irreversible trade-off (depleting last resort); cost legible in exhaustion but could deepen the promise's emotional weight beyond physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through timer's countdown ("masks slip" timeframe), narrowing options to envelope decision. Fury release after *ping* shows visible cost, but "cartography of scars" motivation could deepen tactical friction earlier in pressure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when drifters arrive—their intrusion forces Silas to risk trust, foreclosing solitude. Cost is visceral in the young woman’s trembling but slightly underweighted; her haunted state implies prior trauma but isn’t explicitly tied to the library’s rebirth stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten viscerally when compasses flicker, forcing Elian’s agency: playing the film is a direct response to collapsing pathways. Cost is unmistakable—"leaving his piano behind" crystallizes sacrifice, with "horizon invites night" pressure driving the irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten via Kenji’s agency: lace decoding and tide-waiting narrow options to a single pressure point. Cost is unmistakable—"bitter words... began to diffuse"—but escalation lacks a second intensifying beat.
