  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elena's need to control versus accepting entropy—deepens through accumulating dust patterns that force her from observation to intervention. The tightening occurs when decay threatens the orchids and trellis, though agency remains primarily observational until the final clearing action, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose after trauma—deepens through the frost-reading sequence that narrows Elara's path literally and figuratively. The story achieves one meaningful tightening when frost patterns force a specific route leading to the hidden box. Cost appears in emotional terms (tears, fractured thoughts) though physical stakes remain low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring sound to save art and humanity—is established early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the emotional heat-mapping sequence building to the first recovered note, with cost visible in Elara's channeled trauma. However, the conflict lacks genuine obstacles or reversals; once Elara finds the tuning fork, success feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal exhaustion to collective spiritual unrest, with the lens discovery triggering active engagement. The "impossible spaces" sequence raises cost as Elias risks being pulled into memory whirlpools. His stubbornness driving him into "tighter voids" shows agency under pressure with clear trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (intergenerational unity versus sanctions-driven division) is signaled early and tightens when "whispers of unrest grew among the youth." Elias's agency drives the resolution through his declaration, foreclosing anonymity with visible cost. However, the youth's questioning of elders' ways is told rather than shown through specific conflict, limiting the felt pressure of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—finding stored unused love—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. The breathing technique provides resolution without preceding struggle or failed attempts. No visible price is paid; the transformation happens through convenient revelation rather than earned pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to entrapment to panic as visions intensify ("quaking succession," "deepened," "intensified"). Elias's agency drives the resolution through applying his maze-design knowledge to shatter the trap. The cost is legible—losing the fragment and access to the past—though the middle section could tighten the pressure more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from Elias chained → discovering cipher → decoding under time pressure → activating defenses as invaders breach. The ticking clock of approaching looters creates genuine urgency. Cost is visible in Elias's physical restraint and the risk of vault discovery, with agency maintained through intellectual resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulating absences ("rusted locket without its photo, a captain's log with pages torn out") toward the forge scene where "the sound crystallized—a sharp, resonant snap." The cost manifests in tears and emotional reckoning, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically through the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking destiny through theft—tightens when the portrait reveals not the heiress's secrets but a coded message about the station itself. This reversal narrows her options and forces the choice between continuing theft or embracing creation. Cost is visible but the "voices...felt" resolution edges toward convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through water literally "lapping at the door," forcing Elias to work faster and abandon the space. The embedding of the bookmark represents a meaningful choice between holding pain versus transforming it, though the conflict could push harder against his theatrical coping mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—proving vulnerability as power—manifests through escalating pressure as Mara approaches and Elias must decode the cast while fighting his phobias. The climax delivers meaningful agency when Elias deliberately triggers his claustrophobia to trap Mara, showing clear cost. However, the middle lacks sufficient tightening moments, and Mara's arrival feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom before endless night—intensifies as the single star weakens. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each summarized silence adds to the map while gold flakes detach, creating tangible loss. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would force a harder choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the violin to full amalgamation of timeline memories through playing, with each note deepening the integration. The cost manifests as the merging of all loop versions—"a loop where Eko had watched children play...another where solitude bred doubt"—into singular awareness. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks a moment where Eko might fail or choose differently.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: scattered tickets → lens revelation → visitor's sorrow → Elias's recognition → mutual transparency. The dominant stake of overcoming mistrust tightens when Elias must risk his own vulnerability. Cost is visible in the exposure of "frozen isolation," though the visitor's agency remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal vindication to systemic challenge as Elias's deception deepens. The blight creates genuine urgency, and Thorne's arrival tightens pressure. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off—Elias wins without losing anything meaningful, and Thorne's defeat feels convenient rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from theoretical proof to physical danger when the temporal eddy threatens to pull them into "an alternate hush." The reversal (pulling back the lever) shows agency with clear cost—abandoning the breakthrough to ensure survival. However, the danger emerges abruptly without sufficient build, and resolution comes too easily through simple lever reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (unraveling Vincenzo's code) maintains coherent pressure through accumulative reveals: finding the program, water revealing hidden images, discord unlocking the complete code. The deliberate choice to play discord rather than melody represents meaningful agency that transforms the stakes. Cost is visible in the violation of sacred musical space, though escalation could be sharper—the revelation feels somewhat predetermined once water touches paper.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting the buried truth about her brother—emerges too late and resolves too easily through smudging margins. No meaningful tightening occurs; Thorne's guidance removes obstacles rather than intensifying pressure. The truth's revelation lacks resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—confronting the truth about his father's disappearance—is signaled early but escalation is limited. The ghost appearance raises tension but doesn't force a meaningful choice beyond turning the valve. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through mounting pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—remains consistent but lacks meaningful tightening beyond the keeper's decision to venture forth and return. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through seasonal drift and regenerative silence, but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost until the final return. The obsidian refuge sequence observes change but doesn't force a trade-off or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake (restoring Finn's wonder) is signaled early and the eclipse provides a natural escalation point where Elara reveals her daughter's curl. Yet the conflict lacks genuine pressure—Finn's transformation happens too easily without visible struggle or resistance, and no meaningful option is foreclosed when he accepts wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative discovery—from finding diaries to understanding the displaced axis to discovering the tapestry fragment. Each revelation reweights understanding of the world's condition. However, the pressure doesn't sufficiently tighten options or force trade-offs; Elias encounters no meaningful obstacles or costs in his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes emerge through layered open secrets that Elias systematically exposes via fortune cookies. Escalation occurs through the progression from individual cookie-baking to island-wide distribution. However, the lack of meaningful opposition or complication during the nighttime distribution reduces tension—everyone simply accepts their fortunes without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: loops layer ("phrase looped, layering upon itself"), shadow manifestation intensifies ("shadows coiling at the edges"), and time pressure tightens ("possession would finalize at the stroke of the unseen hour"). The abrupt silence deployment creates the decisive turn with clear cost - nearly being grazed by tendrils.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of mapped memories—from summer wonder to father's riddles to mother's loss—each adding weight to the nautilus shell until it "hummed" with temporal resonance. The exhaustion deadline creates genuine pressure ("limbs already heavy, breaths shallow"), forcing Elias to complete his transformation before physical collapse, with the cost visible in his drained state.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (escaping cyclical existence) escalates through procedural timeline generation, each revealing new costs until Elara confronts her core fear. The "drop and ripple" deadline creates urgency. However, the rapid-fire timeline summaries lack the granular pressure of lived moments—we're told about betrayal and paranoia rather than experiencing their weight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen as the backward songs evolve from experiment to method of connection, with Mira's arrival forcing Elias to test his discovery on another's numbness. The cost appears in "tears tracing her cheeks" and his "chest tightening with shared release," though escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving integrity through isolation versus engaging with the mysterious message—develops through accumulation rather than reversal. Pressure builds as the pigeon arrives with urgent coordinates pointing toward danger. His choice to remain unmoved carries cost, though the escalation could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating sensory pressure: first the orchid's emerging fragrance "teasing the edges of his caution," then the combined scents hitting "like a wave." The cost manifests viscerally as Elias "sank to his knees" in full grief. The transformation's completion creates a deadline that forces confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture before losing humanity to the beings—tightens when the luminous entity materializes offering "knowledge in exchange for his wandering spirit." However, this escalation arrives late (final paragraph), and earlier pressure points like "uncovering layers" lack immediate opposition or cost until the entity appears.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - freeing beauty from the bound bowl - escalates through the ritual sequence: discovering bowl, building fire, storytelling, final unbinding. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each ritual step deepens commitment. The vow "to embrace the unfinished" represents meaningful agency with clear cost (accepting incompletion).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's transformation from counterfeit dealer to authentic emotion guardian—progresses through the ritual's accumulating steps. The static electricity sensing creates tangible pressure as "erratic sparks" reveal discordances that must be subsumed. However, the transformation feels somewhat inevitable rather than fought for; greater resistance or unexpected complication would strengthen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to return the envelope personally—resolves quickly without significant escalation. While there's a minor ethical consideration, Elias decides with minimal resistance, and the subsequent conversation unfolds without meaningful obstacles or reversals. The story lacks pressure that would force harder choices; the alignment between characters is too smooth, missing the friction that would create genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake of belonging progresses through the shared search, with mild escalation as fragments reveal kinship ties. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the search proceeds smoothly without setbacks, and Lirah's acceptance feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (illustrating nature's souls) to world-preservation (extending the giant's nap), with the narrowing timeframe creating pressure. The protagonist drives the resolution through active choices, though the specific cost of borrowing time from the giant's slumber could be more tangibly dramatized beyond abstract "slivers."

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on Elias's need for closure about Mira's fate, with escalation through the ritual's progression from placement to vision. The deepening occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat—the vision provides exactly what he seeks without meaningful trade-off or unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on Elias's self-imposed isolation versus his drive to help—the tape fragment forces this tension to crystallize. The power outage creates temporal pressure (loosened panels, stirred echoes) that motivates his search. His emergence costs him the invisibility he's maintained for decades, a meaningful price paid on-page when he "allowed himself to become visible."

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding plant adaptation through personal metamorphosis—escalates from observation to embodied experience. The transformation intensifies from "tingling fingers" to "legs grew heavy, rooting her in place," with Elara's struggle creating genuine tension. The cost is visible as she sacrifices human form, though the final acceptance feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elias's need to process trauma through art, with the brooch discovery providing a concrete test. The exchange represents a meaningful deepening—shifting from solitary to shared meaning-making. However, tension doesn't fully escalate; Mira's arrival feels convenient rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (magnifying everyday magic) progresses through one meaningful deepening when the cave's forces override Elara's rigid clairvoyance with "fluid awareness." Cost is legible—she loses predictive certainty for spontaneous insight. However, the transformation happens to her rather than through her agency; she discovers the pearl but doesn't actively choose the inhabitation until it's already occurring.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—healing communal wounds through compiled memories—is signaled early and maintains coherence. The staggered revelation method creates a gentle escalation as the community gradually transforms from doubt to action. However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or meaningful tightening; the exiles' acceptance feels too smooth, and most escalation occurs through summary rather than dramatized resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (confronting family truth) is signaled early and escalates through physical journey paralleling emotional stakes. However, the resolution arrives without sufficient resistance—the fortress simply appears and truths are revealed without Elias having to fight for them. The cost ("bad habits shatter") is declared rather than felt through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—resolving Kai's entangled memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must choose between skepticism and action. The escalation through transcription (laughter→illness→guilt) shows deepening emotional cost. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or genuine resistance; the transcription proceeds too smoothly once begun, missing opportunity for meaningful complication that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering what lies beyond goodbye—is clear, but escalation feels predetermined rather than earned through agency. The spatial mutiny provides external pressure, yet Elowen's manipulation of it reads as too controlled ("controlled chaos"), lacking genuine risk or meaningful obstacles that would force harder choices with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (completing father's con) to life-or-death (Elena's asylum), with the midnight deadline creating time pressure. Alex's active waiting while calculating "risk factors multiplied by moral weights" shows agency driving escalation. The cost is clear: detection risk and moral compromise of Alex's honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes emerge through the town's mysterious silence and Elias's role as custodian of forgotten histories. The escalation through discovering "the velvety nap of an explorer's journal" that carries a warning provides meaningful deepening. However, the final realization lacks immediate pressure—"he must collect more" suggests future action rather than present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing identity through collected memories—escalates through accumulation rather than reversal. The poison bottle discovery provides meaningful deepening that recontextualizes the survivor's condition. However, the resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than genuinely pressured by accumulated fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through the ephemeral compass's fading guidance and the logbook's closing pages creating time pressure. The riddle deepens from abstract questioning to embodied discovery through the cello's resonance, though the resolution lacks a decisive trade-off or visible sacrifice beyond the compass dissolving.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.6)
    The gentrification threat establishes clear stakes, and pressure accumulates through corporate encroachment. However, escalation happens through summary ("weeks passed") rather than dramatized beats. The final confrontation with the corporate envoy lacks specific tactical opposition—the crowd simply "gathers" without showing how Lanara's encoded messages actually mobilized them through concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - capturing the grain's final act - is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through timed chemical messages and the approaching dawn, with one meaningful tightening as the grain begins glowing. However, Elena faces no real opposition or complication that might force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ticking clock of the ship's dawn departure creates genuine urgency, and Elias's method reveals increasing stakes as he discovers the drone's navigation system through sound. However, the resolution comes too easily without meaningful complication or trade-off beyond time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the dominant stake (finding where rivers begin) is clear, escalation remains minimal - the falcon returns with coordinates, Elias reads patterns, then departs. No meaningful tightening occurs that forecloses options or forces trade-offs. The "worrying tranquility" creates atmosphere but doesn't build to a pressure point requiring costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on preventing collapse through restoring balance, with escalation through growing participation, but pressure never truly tightens—each addition feels additive rather than transformative. The resolution arrives without genuine opposition or cost; success comes too easily through persistence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Oxygen depletion creates escalating time pressure that forces Elara's pivotal choice between escape and mission completion. The conflict between survival instinct and purpose deepens effectively, with her conscious override of panic ("forced herself to stillness") demonstrating agency, though the abstract "unsnarling" action slightly softens the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking redemption from inherited lies—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulative pressure of climbing toward the chapel and the intensification when ghosts appear. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance; Elias achieves his goal relatively easily once he understands what's needed, and the ticking clock of "before they find the bodies" never creates real pressure since we don't see consequences approaching.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating visits that progressively awaken the orchard while draining Elias, with visible cost in "her loving venom seeping into his veins." The tension between healing the land and losing himself provides pressure, though individual visits lack distinct escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin to reverence—is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure since transformation occurs through unconscious sleepwalking without resistance or complication. No meaningful obstacles oppose Elara's goal; the other sleepwalkers harmoniously collaborate without conflict. The resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract—"restore lost faith" never faces concrete tests or trade-offs. The excavation proceeds without meaningful opposition; "cautious enchantment" creates atmosphere but no actual pressure that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara simply digs progressively deeper and finds what she seeks without cost or competing goods to choose between.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—we're told about "secrets from the city's underbelly" and "forbidden tales" but never see concrete danger or cost. The story declares tension without dramatizing it; Elara's work proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or meaningful pressure that would force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the coup conspiracy—escalates through layered revelations from adjacent possibilities, culminating in the high astronomer's betrayal. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each story adds detail. However, the escalation relies heavily on summarized discoveries rather than dramatized struggle, limiting felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: from seeking the unspoken apology, to drawing blood, to manifesting messages, to confronting the core wound "I loved you fiercely, tenderly." The dominant stake (reclaiming the moment before deciding) tightens as messages intensify. Cost appears in blood drawn, tears shed, and the sob at recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake of healing emotional wounds escalates through Elena's recognition of her own fears in Amir's anxiety about his leg. The decryption of the cast notes deepens pressure by revealing the hidden poem. Cost is visible in both characters' vulnerability, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal recovery to communal contribution as Elara moves from discovering fragments to creating shareable joy-memories. The network activation represents a meaningful deepening that changes her options from passive reception to active creation. Cost is legible in the acknowledgment that joys were "merely veiled" requiring deliberate exposure work.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—escalates through deepening awakening layers, each revealing more abstract realms where "questions hung like fruit." The hobo nickel's reflected sounds drive progression, though the metaphysical nature of the conflict reduces visceral pressure. The final awakening sequence builds appropriate tension before returning to the scaffold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from meeting secretly to planting the seed to confronting drones, with the dominant stake (protecting cognitive freedom) clear throughout. The reversal when drones descend forces immediate action, and Elias's choice to activate the rattle carries visible cost in the group's scattering. However, the resolution relies partly on the convenient bio-engineering rather than character-driven tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (reunion with lost love) is clear, but escalation reads as repetitive accumulation rather than meaningful tightening—Elowen sings, verses bloom, the postcard pulses, she materializes. No genuine reversal or complication tests his commitment, and the resolution arrives through persistence alone without visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving what remains of extinct emotions—faces escalation when the cracked tube threatens permanent silence. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her choice to use the damaged instrument, accepting imperfection. The cost is legible: temporary preservation against inevitable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ticking clock of "dawn would bring Thorne's departure" creates genuine urgency, and Elara's ritual escalates from inscription to manifestation to revelation. However, Thorne offers no resistance or complication—he simply arrives and accepts, making the resolution feel uncontested despite the established mistrust.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict between traditionalists and opportunists establishes clear stakes, with Elias's discovery providing the mechanism for resolution. However, escalation remains gentle—no direct opposition challenges his solution, and the harmonious ending arrives without meaningful resistance or sacrifice, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (learning to trust) is signaled early and deepens through Aria's training. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias releases Aria with his truth. However, escalation feels gradual rather than pressured—months pass with methodical practice rather than mounting urgency. The resolution through the friend's reply deflates earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—Elias analyzes wood grain and reads a logbook without facing opposition or tightening pressure. His "intuiting" never meets resistance or forces trade-offs. The dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) remains abstract without concrete test or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of finding belonging escalates from passive observation to active ritual to synchronized communion. The burnt feather discovery triggers action, and spectral guardians provide meaningful test of Elara's yearning. Cost appears in accepting permanent attunement to the deep over surface life, though agency could be stronger in the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—never faces concrete opposition or escalating pressure; Elara simply examines seeds sequentially without obstacles, setbacks, or meaningful tightening of options. No reversal or deepening occurs that would force a trade-off or foreclose possibilities. The resolution arrives without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming monotony through orchestrated wonder—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition. The performance succeeds without complication or cost; Mira's participation is too easily won. No meaningful tightening occurs as everything unfolds according to Elias's plan without forcing trade-offs or revealing prices.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—defying enforced forgetting through permanent inscription—is signaled early and tested when Elara becomes "spontaneously anchored" mid-ritual, forcing acceptance rather than panic. This reversal narrows her options from mobile transcendence to stationary monument. However, the nostalgia ban lacks immediate pressure, and the transformation feels more mystical inevitability than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning before industrialization—is signaled early but lacks concrete escalation. The pond ritual represents Elias's agency through attention and communion, but no meaningful tightening occurs. The "impending upheaval" creates urgency without forcing a visible trade-off or foreclosing options, keeping the conflict philosophical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Eli's need to "translate pain into a universal language"—is signaled early but faces no real opposition or escalation. The encounter with Mia provides opportunity rather than conflict, and Eli's sharing costs him nothing beyond reopening old wounds he's clearly processed before. No meaningful tightening occurs; the story maintains the same emotional register throughout without building pressure toward the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes center on revitalizing hope across timelines, but escalation reads as repetitive success rather than mounting pressure—each trial balloon works, each pattern succeeds. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Elara faces no resistance or cost. The conflict lacks the "one meaningful tightening" required, as her method simply works three times without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth to lighten inherited burden—remains consistent but escalation is modest. The discovery of diaries and film negative deepens understanding but doesn't force a costly choice; Elara's vow to "chart not just echoes, but redemptions" lacks concrete opposition or sacrifice that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming mirrors before the borrowed heartbeat expires—is signaled early. However, escalation remains flat; the painter encounters no resistance or complication, proceeding smoothly from setup to success. The "hush before bells ring" creates mild temporal pressure but no meaningful tightening that would force trade-offs or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—ending the forever war through personal sacrifice—is clear early. The ritual provides escalation as spirits arrive and Elara pays the physical cost. However, conflict lacks genuine resistance; the spirits simply appear and agree without negotiation or complication, making the resolution feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from Elias trudging through his created wasteland to discovering the crack-map to releasing both water and bird-echo. The cost is legible - financial ruin and exposure. One meaningful tightening as he follows the cracks to the valve satisfies this length, though the internal conflict could sharpen further at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—breaking conformity's hold—is established early and tightens as Elara performs the dangerous ritual. The "alarming serenity" creates consistent pressure, and her agency drives the escalation. However, the opposition remains abstract (watchful eyes, potential wrath) rather than manifesting as concrete obstacles during the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether art can serve truth rather than manipulation—is clear and tightens through Elias's reversal decision. Cost is visible in losing Lena and abandoning lucrative deception, but escalation happens through internal reflection rather than present-scene pressure testing his new commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from private ritual to cosmic alignment when the monarch's arrival interrupts Elias's cadence, forcing him to choose between control and witness. The cost appears in "his transient roots pulling free" though the pressure could tighten more sharply through the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal forgiveness to cultural preservation through the rope reconfiguration. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as density increases toward closure, though the conflict lacks a meaningful counter-force or complication beyond technical difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—escalates through the storm's approach, the bunker discovery, and the dream revelation that reframes her gift. The closure shows genuine cost as she accepts being chosen rather than choosing, though middle escalation relies heavily on atmospheric pressure rather than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. The ritual proceeds smoothly from drawing schematics to portal opening to covenant acceptance without reversal or tightening pressure. No visible price is paid; Elias gains knowledge without sacrificing anything concrete, and the "frugal vigilance" he offers costs him nothing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from Thorne's arrival with festering resentment to his physical convulsion and release, with the sanctuary's reality shifts adding pressure. The dominant stake (teaching resentment to release) faces concrete test through the pin's activation of cellular memory. Cost is visible in Thorne's physical reaction and the loss of his defensive anger. One meaningful deepening occurs as childhood memories surface to fracture adult resentment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the dream that holds his wife's memory—is established early and deepens through the breathing ritual that "erases the divide between flesh and fantasy." Escalation occurs through the intensifying synchronization sequence (inhale/exhale pattern) that transforms both Elias and the environment. The cost is legible in the years of loss and the physical/spiritual effort required, though the resolution lacks a final test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    Physical danger from the climb provides immediate stakes, but tension deflates when Elias easily secures himself with twine and descends "grumbling but triumphant." The true conflict—bridging generational wisdom despite grief—lacks sufficient resistance; Lila's ready acceptance undermines the stakes of transmission. The accidental spilling creates a meaningful turn, but resolution comes too smoothly without testing either character's limits.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on the price of forbidden knowledge ("unraveling your own timeline"). Pressure accumulates through mirror visions, spectral voices, and the cameo's activation, building toward Elias's acceptance of eternal solitude. The warning of erasure "from the pages altogether" provides concrete cost, though the philosophical abstraction sometimes diffuses immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (preventing temporal collapse) is clear, and pressure escalates through the guardian confrontation and trap navigation. However, the negotiation resolves too easily through a clever loophole without genuine trade-offs or visible cost—the guardians simply concede. The "rescue mission" succeeds without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed options, undermining the stakes' weight.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's progressive recapture of twin essence, with the fog's "trapped freedom" creating persistent pressure. The cost is visible in the transformation from fragmented to unified self. One meaningful deepening occurs as narrative threads accumulate power. The resolution feels slightly too neat with the fog's convenient lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from discovery through the cacophony of voices threatening to overwhelm, forcing Elara to reconfigure the rope under pressure. The cost manifests as the door's permanent vanishing—a trade-off for preserving the recovered knowledge. However, the resolution feels somewhat mechanical, lacking visceral tension in the climactic weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from general disruption to specific ice examination to the bloom's contested emergence, with the beings' "hammering energies clashing against the spreading repose" providing clear opposition. The tightening occurs when Elara must hold the conjured bloom against active resistance. However, the energy beings never adapt or specify their threat beyond "pulses of raw power," limiting the conflict's texture and preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear from the start - proving meaning exists in apparent chaos. Escalation follows causal logic: discovering the prism → understanding its purpose → tracking the shard → physical cost of retrieval. The bleeding hands and muted wind provide visible cost. Agency drives every turn through Elara's choices. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before it erodes—is signaled early and remains consistent. Pressure builds through the "deepening hush" and the Archivist's discoveries of distortions in collective recall (the unnaturally elongated shadow, the hidden schism). However, escalation remains observational rather than forcing choices with cost; she continues her method without adaptation or trade-offs that would demonstrate true stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (overcoming creative despair) signaled early through chanting and "fizzled" fireworks. The fire-spinning deepens pressure by forcing Elias to risk physical danger for illumination, with the mosaic's full message emerging as meaningful reward. Cost is legible in tears and the "release of hopelessness's grip," though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (Elara's departure) maintains coherence, with one meaningful deepening when the pause stretches and Kael foresees her journey. However, escalation relies heavily on Kael's passive observation rather than active pressure—the conflict doesn't sufficiently tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (escape claustrophobia through silence collection) with time pressure from the one-hour window. The journey shows progression from bunker to trellis to collection, but lacks meaningful obstacles or reversals—Elara succeeds at each attempt without significant cost. The resolution arrives too smoothly; her claustrophobia simply transforms without dramatized struggle at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from Mira's demand for "haste" through her resistance ("It's too quiet") to acceptance, with the storm glass revealing how "disturbances agitated the liquid" versus stillness bringing clarity. The cost appears in her surrendered urgency and changed breathing, though the middle resistance could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sunrise deadline creates time pressure, and Elara's journey escalates from archive to city underbelly to hidden orchard. However, no meaningful opposition or complication tests her resolve—she simply follows the ruby flake's guidance without setback or trade-off. The stakes remain abstract (restoring "balance") without concrete consequences for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on whether Elara will maintain her isolation or reconnect with Lorin. The encroachment escalates from "subtle chill wind" to full manifestation, forcing Elara's choice. The cost is visible in both characters' transformation. However, Lorin's quick acceptance undermines the conflict's full potential - more resistance would strengthen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (transforming past trauma into wealth) is signaled early and pressure escalates from receiving messages to diving to retrieving the bolt. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance—Elara faces no meaningful obstacles during the dive itself, and the bolt comes free with playful ease, undermining the stakes despite the conceptual cost being clear.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of uncovering family truth escalates through the physical act of turning the crank and experiencing the standing waves, with cost visible in the dynasty's end. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance—the revelation comes too easily through spectral voices without meaningful obstacles or choices that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing possibility before it dissolves—escalates from discovering the program through performing the ritual to achieving transformation, with the unsnapping of the gauntlet as decisive cost. However, the escalation lacks intermediate resistance or complication; Elandor proceeds smoothly from discovery to success without meaningful obstacles testing his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking healing through historical kindness—escalates through the dust-pattern discovery and button revelation. The accumulative pressure builds as details layer (orphaned boy, Union soldier, Quaker home), though the stakes remain primarily internal. The cost is felt in Elara's emotional response but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate clearly from data drives seized to Elara alone with the key to successful broadcast but at cost of exposure. The dominant stake—preserving resistance against indifference—tightens through the raid forcing her to her contingency plan. Agency drives the resolution as Elara adapts her broadcast method when the lines fail, with visible cost in her stepping into the open knowing capture looms.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from whispered prophecy to glowing manifestations to the threat of awakening dormant guardians. The saxophonist's agency drives the conflict through deliberate musical choices and strategic silences. The cost appears in his memories of "lonely path" and the emotional weight of preserving peace, though the physical/immediate cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation as monuments activate increasingly visible magic—from swirling leaves to "ethereal glow" to guardian emergence. The dominant stake (decoding prophecies for renewal) tightens when the Leaf Whisperer validates her method. However, the resolution lacks sharp trade-off; Elara gains without meaningful sacrifice beyond accepting "chaotic joy."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through pattern recognition (clocks ticking erratically) → compass discovery → treacherous waterfall navigation → crystal vein chamber. The dominant stake (rigid control versus embracing uncertainty) tightens as Elias must literally improvise dance-like movements across the ledge. Cost is visible in abandoning his "meticulous diagrams," though the physical danger could generate more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—redeeming past failure with Aurora—is signaled early and deepens through the alchemical reconstruction process. Escalation occurs as Elias pushes limits, invoking the full zodiac cycle until "the foundry trembled," with visible cost in accepting rather than erasing scars. However, the reconstruction faces no meaningful opposition or complication; success feels predetermined once he begins.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation reads through accumulative intensification: harp notes distort → Thorne materializes → confession deepens → laughter integrates → soul releases. The dominant stake (collecting Thorne's soul) tightens as confession reveals the crocodile betrayal, with cost visible in the tooth transformation. However, Thorne offers minimal resistance beyond "spectral defiance," limiting true opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering mathematical mercy—deepens through Elara's trauma response sequence, with her body becoming the site of escalating pressure. However, agency remains largely passive (memories happen to her rather than being pursued), and the resolution arrives through convenient insight rather than earned struggle. The cost is visible in physical terms but the intellectual breakthrough lacks causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early but escalation remains minimal under the Accumulative lens. Each painting reveals information without forcing trade-offs or narrowing Elara's options. The resolution occurs through accumulation rather than earned reversal, with no visible price paid for releasing the voices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from investigating an anonymous call to discovering trapped souls to freeing them, with the mainspring barrel creating a concrete mechanism for resolution. The "weightless burden" intensifies as ghosts multiply, forcing Elias's choice to engage. Cost is visible when spirits dissolve into "luminous wisps," though the personal price to Elias beyond relief could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through pattern intensification: frost study → mandala discovery → whisper release → press alignment → rupture cascade, with each action irreversibly destabilizing the system. Cost manifests in "the library tilted, clouds boiling upward" and the permanent alteration of perfection, though the stakes could tighten more sharply between discovering the mandala and deploying it.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the civilization's true nature to settle the archaeological dispute—is clear. The temporal storm creates genuine obstacle requiring Elias's mirror-covering solution, a concrete action with causal impact. However, the conflict lacks visceral urgency; the archaeological dispute remains somewhat abstract, and the personal stakes of Elias's revolutionary past don't sufficiently pressure his present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light from midnight—is established early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs when midnight resists with "inky tendrils" and whispers that make the ferns wilt, forcing Elias to sing louder. However, the antagonist remains abstract (midnight as concept rather than embodied force), and the resolution feels too swift—darkness simply "shatters" without sustained struggle or meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to existential transformation as Elara discovers the explorers' fate. The three hinged awakenings create meaningful deepening, with cost visible in her risky solo descent and the transformative immersion. Agency drives the closure through her deliberate choice to wade into the mysterious waters.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's drive to transform historical complexity into accessible art—faces escalation when the magic slide reveals deeper temporal connections. The storm provides external pressure while the visions create internal urgency. However, there's no significant cost or trade-off; she achieves her artistic goal without sacrificing anything meaningful, which prevents entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (understanding night-blooming flowers as metaphor for hidden resilience) deepens through postcard discoveries and glass revelations. However, escalation is gentle rather than pressured - Elara faces no real opposition or time constraint, and the "reckoning" lacks concrete trade-offs or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: encrypted diary → retrocognitive trap → failed verbal parley → debris messages → confession → final map revelation. The stakes tighten as "the reverie scorching his mind with the intensity of unresolved pain," though the specter's responses feel somewhat convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding civilization through genuine effort versus magical shortcuts—is established early. Elias's rejection of the bottle and subsequent mental reconstruction demonstrate agency with visible cost ("hours turned to days"). However, the escalation plateaus during the extended working memory sequence, and the arrival of returning residents lacks sufficient pressure or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving humanity's emotional patterns before they fade—is signaled early and drives Elias's immersion. The foghorn's silence creates initial pressure, and the immersion deepens through memory and ritual, but the escalation relies heavily on coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The accidental prophecy and its fulfillment feel externally imposed rather than earned through Elias's choices, though cost becomes visible in the building's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from preserving the hatched phoenix through the ritual's mounting intensity ("winds stirred without source") to Elara stepping into the vortex. The deepening occurs through accumulative pressure rather than reversal. Cost appears in the visions but could be more viscerally felt in the protagonist's body or immediate consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes crystallize at zero hour when Elias must choose between his listening method and the traditional siren, with village safety hanging in the balance. The escalation through barometric readings to the storm's eastward veer provides one meaningful tightening, though the resolution arrives without a second pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding strength through vulnerability—develops through accumulation rather than escalating pressure, with Elara's empathetic connection to a falling star serving as the single meaningful deepening moment. No tangible cost materializes; her transformation requires no sacrifice or trade-off, only philosophical acceptance. The "flourishing stillness" remains abstract without forcing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—develops through Elias's careful excavation and contemplation of the box, with tension building through his hesitation to open it immediately. The ghostly revelation provides meaningful deepening, though the resolution lacks a sharper cost or trade-off that would elevate the emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to understand time toward sharing that understanding with "a world adrift," with the ticking urgency of borrowed time creating pressure. The discovery sequence (capsule→urn→flyers→ritual) provides textural deepening, though the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off or visible price beyond what was already established.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from aesthetic pursuit to mythic healing as Elias discovers the drake's deeper discord beyond physical wounds. The harmonizing method creates genuine tension about whether poetry can heal cosmic unraveling. Cost is visible in the drake's permanent imperfection and Elias's acceptance that beauty lies in incompleteness, though the conflict lacks a forceful opposing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of fostering interspecies respect is declared early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Elias proceeds "with unyielding serenity" through his project without setbacks, discoveries that alter tactics, or genuine pressure beyond his illness. The transformation succeeds too smoothly without earned reversals or visible prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of understanding homecoming's chemistry is clear, but escalation is gentle rather than pressurized. The accumulation of footprints and pilgrims provides textural deepening consistent with the lens. The cost of displacement is present but could be more sharply felt through specific losses or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - transforming battlefield to garden - is clear, but escalation is minimal under the accumulative lens. The ritual proceeds without meaningful obstacles or tightening pressure. While the story deepens through symbolic layering, it lacks a moment where the protagonist's commitment is truly tested or where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding Elara's brother/truth about survivors) is clear, but escalation remains modest—discovering leaf leads to riddle leads to cylinder leads to coordinates. The warning about "tinted revelations" and illusions adds complexity but doesn't create sufficient pressure or force a costly trade-off. The final step forward shows agency but lacks the tightening that would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning in isolation) builds through accumulative pressure toward the nebula discovery. The revelation genuinely transforms her options. Cost is present but could be more viscerally felt in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from physical peril (scaling) to cosmic (fixing the sky) to moral (honoring the Archmage). The chess piece swap carries real tension with ethereal wards threatening discovery. The Archmage's awakening creates a genuine reversal, though his transformation happens too quickly to maximize pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through the walking pattern intensifying from "RELEASE" to "UNBIND" to "HISTORIAN," with the penumbra's resistance creating counter-pressure. The cost appears as "freed gestures on whispering winds" and Alex claiming his role, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than viscerally threatening.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal pain management to recovering lost abilities to rebuilding a destroyed community of talents. The feather ritual creates genuine tension as Elara must abandon her coping mechanism (substituting reality) to unlock truth. However, the conflict lacks active opposition—the transformation proceeds smoothly once begun, and the "thunderous betrayal" remains abstract backstory rather than present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through Elias's progression from wandering to active confrontation with the tapestry, with each decoded thread revealing painful truths about his mistake. The winnowing process shows agency driving escalation with visible cost in confronting "arrogance" and "overlooking the opponent's subtle traps." Minor deduction for relatively predictable progression without significant reversal or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—earning forgiveness through refraction—is clear early. Pressure accumulates through the poetry sessions building toward dawn's ritual, with each verse "chipping at her resolve." However, the escalation plateaus rather than intensifies; the visions add texture but don't fundamentally alter her options or force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure—each pockmark repair raises stakes as breath depletes and acid rises. The dominant stake (salvaging purpose from oblivion) tightens through physical constraint and time pressure. Cost is visible in burning lungs and the workshop's corroding underbelly, though the final triumph over the acid sea feels slightly unearned given the established threat level.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—confronting buried grief to reclaim his soul—is signaled early and maintains coherence. The wrong turn creates meaningful complication, and the grotto forces Elias to face his promise. However, escalation feels mechanical rather than earned; the magical shell projection reduces agency at the crucial moment when human choice should dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers reach farther than shouts—gets tested through the cork ritual, but escalation is minimal as Elias performs his intent-sending without opposition or complication. The miraculous resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through moon phases from "subtle signals" to "flooded calls," with each cryptic message adding urgency to the compass construction. The dominant stake—mapping paths through grief—tightens as voices accumulate: "I left the locket in the attic of regrets... guide me back." Cost manifests in the navigator's "stitched heart" aching with "raw solace."

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—achieving psychological safety from empathy echoes—is clear from the start. The storm provides external pressure during the ritual, but there's no meaningful complication or reversal that tests Elara's commitment. The ritual proceeds exactly as planned without forcing trade-offs or revealing unexpected costs beyond the abstract "graceful fracture" that mends.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating visions that deepen from surface memories to deliberate erasures, with Elias realizing he's become guardian of secrets. The gaps themselves become the pressure—what's missing drives urgency more than what's shown. However, the investigation lacks a decisive tightening moment where Elias must choose between preserving his isolation or accepting the burden, reducing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rising creek creates genuine time pressure that escalates from "trickle to torrent," forcing Elias to act before "floodwaters would soon seal the paths." The stakes tighten as water seeps into lower chambers, and his choice to abandon the map for the ants' path shows agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession through physical danger to kingdom-level betrayal, with the climb providing concrete pressure. The "lacy menace" manifests in ice crystals "sharp enough to slice flesh" and the starlight's temptations. Cost is visible when Elara must choose between the power that "could shatter her soul" and truth, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Thorne's confession creates genuine pressure that forces Elara's response, and her portal journey represents meaningful escalation through action rather than mere reflection. However, the transformation lacks visible struggle or trade-off; she returns resolved without dramatized internal conflict or clear cost beyond the implied risk of changing their friendship.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with mortality after seeing one's own grave—is signaled early and deepens through the dream sequence where past selves embody lost freedom. The protagonist's agency manifests in choosing to soar and confront the grave image, with the cost of accepting death as "just another chapter to chronicle" legible in the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning after loss—escalates through Mira's revelation of pregnancy and her grandmother's death, forcing both women to confront inheritance and continuity. The screw's discovery creates a meaningful tightening that reframes the clock from broken object to generational talisman. Cost is visible in Mira's tears and Elara's recognition of parallel losses.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming trauma into empowerment) established early and tested through the crystallization crisis during the held-breath moment. Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure: stress mounting → crystals forming → movement locked → resolution through superstition. Cost is visible in the vulnerability of returning to childhood beliefs. Missing stronger mid-scene tightening that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - reconciliation before it's too late - is established early through the orchard's countdown. Escalation occurs through the summoning ritual building to confrontation, though the ghost's appearance feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. The partial forgiveness carries genuine cost but lacks the resistance that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (unifying illusions to restore harmony) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. There's minimal escalation beyond the "universe's hiccup intensifying"—no concrete opposition or tightening that forces trade-offs. The resolution occurs through the Witness's invocation without dramatized resistance or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's true nature—escalates through the countdown sequence where each memory brings Elias closer to dangerous knowledge about "razor edges." The reversal of water flow and manifestation of "hairline fractures in the glass" represent meaningful deepening under the textural lens. While agency drives the investigation through key-turning and deliberate counting, the abstract nature of the revelation slightly softens the visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rogue fungal strain creates legitimate external pressure that forces collaboration and leads to Elara's breakthrough about dynamic barriers. The stakes escalate from professional threat to personal revelation with clear cost. The internal/external conflict interweaving works, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on Elara reconciling her theoretical nature with experiential wisdom, but escalation remains internal without external pressure testing her choices. The cryptic messages provide texture but don't genuinely narrow options or force trade-offs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - Elias's project of teaching through estrangement - escalates through accumulation of examples until the musician's callback forces Elias to confront his own isolation. The cost is legible when he "froze" and must "loop the call to himself," though the resolution feels slightly neat. The pattern-break when someone "pierced the veil" provides meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes the stake of preserving memory early and builds pressure through the ritual's steps. However, there's no meaningful opposition or tightening—Elias performs each step without obstacle or cost, and the "haunted euphoria" arrives without earned resistance. The ritual succeeds too smoothly, lacking the friction that would make the closure feel consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal loneliness to collective vulnerability as the rumor chains catalyze genuine connection. The reciprocity requirement creates meaningful pressure—each must risk their story to participate. Cost is visible when Elias abandons his elusive patterns, though the group's unanimous participation lacks tension or meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating sensory languages that sharpen Elara's perception, leading to the stillpoint discovery where "all sounds canceled into profound silence." The quiet blaze intensifies as he approaches resolution, though the journey lacks a moment where Elara must choose between competing paths or face potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt over the seed mistake to actively rewriting history, with the anomaly's pressure forcing action. The cost is visible (isolation, crew evacuation) but the resolution through the pen feels too convenient without sufficient resistance or trade-off to fully earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central stake of artistic redemption through silence escalates as Elias progresses from passive wandering to active composition. The mapping method provides meaningful deepening that transforms his relationship to silence. Cost is visible in the "years of muted creativity" though the resolution feels somewhat swift for the established melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through artistic discoveries that deepen Elias's connection to his promise, with each creation raising emotional cost. The vandalized portrait forces confrontation with his arsonist identity ("mirroring his own arsonist's guilt"). Final stakes crystallize when he must recreate the tapestry to honor Mira. One meaningful deepening achieved through accumulation, though physical danger is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation builds through Elara's drumming intensifying from thighs to crystals to the lagoon itself, with each stage releasing greater harmonic responses. However, the stakes remain largely internal without clear opposition or cost—the scientists' warnings create no active pressure, and the final response lacks the decisive weight needed for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The challenge creates clear stakes with two competing methods tested under storm pressure, escalating as Marcus's team falters while Elias's progresses. The cost is visible in Marcus's exhausted defeat and transformation from boastful to trudging. The geomagnetic interference meaningfully complicates the conflict rather than merely decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (confession of theft) is clear but lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens. The guardian's light patterns don't create mounting pressure that forces Elara's confession—she could walk away at any point. No visible cost or trade-off occurs when she finally speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from teaching chess to orchestrating town-wide rebellion through the accumulating chorus of unspoken doubts. The synchronized window displays create meaningful pressure that forces the town toward reflection. However, the Prognosticators remain abstract antagonists, and we don't see Elias face direct opposition or pay personal cost for his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake of freedom versus connection escalates through the scrimshaw's emotional unlocking and culminates in the whale's call. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as Elara's true nature emerges, forcing the trade-off between love and authenticity. Cost is legible in Marek's acceptance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes established immediately through the happiness mandate's enforcement. Pressure escalates from Elias's solo performance to Mira's arrival with forbidden locket, building through the whittling ritual that transforms grief. The "cultivated lightness" represents meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, though the resolution lacks a sharper moment of irreversible choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—striding through sacred boundaries—is signaled early and tested when Elias approaches the dangerous colonnade. Escalation occurs through the paraphrasing sequence that progressively dissolves boundaries. However, no meaningful opposition emerges; the colonnade simply responds favorably to his approach, reducing genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace color vision or accept colorblind perception—escalates through Elias's barter, the spirit's acceptance, and his horrified reversal. The cost is legible when colors reveal "garish clashes" and "ugly scars" that destroy the beauty he sought. Minor deduction for the spirit's too-easy compliance with the reversal, which reduces tension at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering "texture of connection"—remains abstract throughout. Elara's questions ("Why do we assume connection is loud?") generate philosophical movement but no concrete opposition or trade-offs. The lamp lens cracking provides token physical tension but doesn't force a meaningful choice. No genuine cost materializes beyond the abstract "forever changed."

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (renewal from rock bottom) is signaled early and the curtains provide a concrete obstacle, but escalation remains flat—Lira's journey from arrival to transformation lacks intermediate pressures or meaningful resistance. The tattoo application should carry more risk or cost; instead it reads as smooth progression without the tightening that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake - understanding cultural collapse patterns to find redemption paths - is signaled early and maintained. The measuring tape revelation provides one meaningful deepening that reweights Elara's inherited practice. However, Marcus's transformation lacks visible struggle; his confession flows too smoothly without resistance or complication that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—purifying nostalgic atoms to access forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The "steadily unpredictable" dance creates pressure, but escalation remains conceptual rather than visceral, lacking concrete obstacles or genuine risk beyond abstract "unyielding grief."

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from noticing an anomaly to discovering it erodes archived hopes, then recognizing it as her own past regret, forcing the choice to bind rather than destroy it. The cost is legible: "in preserving hope's shape, she'd confronted the unbound parts of herself, forever changed."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (rebuilding trust while maintaining compassion) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation—Elias moves through symbolic actions (tearing papers, writing in journal, feeding chameleon) without facing genuine pressure that narrows options. No real tightening occurs; he simply proceeds through his reconstruction unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - finding closure through reading scars - deepens as Elara tunnels mentally into wounds, with visions cascading to reveal hidden narratives. Cost appears as tears and resurfaced grief, though the escalation feels more accumulative than pressured. The plants' encouragement provides texture but reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) progresses through discovery of the film strip, psychometric reading revealing Harlan's story, and final understanding. The escalation from seeking to finding to understanding shows clear deepening under the accumulative lens, with emotional cost visible in "hushed thunder" building to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is established early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The meteor shower provides visual spectacle but no real escalation of pressure. The resolution arrives through mystical communion rather than earned struggle, lacking the tightening that would make the liberation feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating hope from extinction's shadows—escalates through Elias's discovery and activation of the archive, with the chess clock's unfreezing marking a decisive turn. The cost manifests in his commitment to "endless vigils" and the fractured nature of his success, though the conflict lacks immediate opposition beyond the world's entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the three-grove progression from loosening mental threads to unraveling doubt to full psychic unwinding. Each wind type (moaning, whistling, tinkling) deepens the transformation with visible effect. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition—the protagonist faces no meaningful setbacks or competing pressures, just steady progress toward his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding courage after breaking free from doubt—is signaled early and maintains coherent pressure through the guides' test and the traversal of dangerous paths. The escalation through "indirect routes, skirting sheer drops" provides meaningful tightening, though the conflict remains primarily internal/metaphorical rather than dramatically visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety versus voice—is established early and deepens through the bolt discovery. The story achieves one meaningful turn when Elias discovers the connection to his past. However, escalation relies heavily on internal realization rather than dramatized pressure, and the resolution lacks the visceral cost the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating cryptic messages that gradually destabilize Vesper, with clear tightening as his "illusory poise cracking like fine porcelain." The climax where he activates the forbidden ritual that turns against him shows agency meeting consequence. Cost is visible in his literal dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds through tapping rhythms that evolve from habit to method to revelation, with the storm intensifying urgency. The dominant stake—discovering vanished migration paths—tightens when Morse patterns reveal both answer and father's complicity. Cost manifests in tears and the weight of sharing truth "with a world still healing."

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reigniting the stalled rebellion—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. Elara moves from wandering to climbing to activating stones without meaningful resistance or complication. The "thunderous serenity" builds atmosphere but pressure doesn't tighten; the stone circle simply works when touched, providing resolution without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from reconstruction needs to kite discovery to decoded coordinates to the final dive. The embryo's "implanted destiny" meaningfully tightens options—tradition or evolution—with visible cost when "Word of her act spread, challenging the elders."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure - from quiet tending to trauma trigger to breakthrough - with the pearl becoming tactile proof of his motivation. The "distant rumble" effectively catalyzes the crisis, though the resolution could show more immediate cost beyond trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: walls closing in, reality fragmenting, then Elias's descent into darkness where he must untangle threads to survive. The dominant stake—artistic authenticity versus existential dissolution—tightens effectively. However, the resolution through thread-untangling feels slightly convenient; the cost of "unraveling first" is stated but not fully dramatized in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding time dilation to prevent future disasters) is signaled early but remains largely abstract. The sabotage creates initial conflict but resolves without meaningful escalation—Elowen simply proceeds with his experiment unimpeded. The discovery itself lacks tangible cost or trade-off; he gains knowledge without sacrificing anything concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal duty conflict to systemic exposure with clear cost. The discovery-decision-action sequence tightens options effectively. However, the dormant networks' convenient activation deflates earned pressure, and the immediate positive response ("fellow dissident stirred") undercuts the risk Elara supposedly takes.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of "weaving continuity through chaos" is signaled early and tested through Elara's rejection of violence and choice to transform the wartime artifact into a gardening tool. While this represents meaningful agency, the escalation remains gentle without a sharp tightening that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on catching the divine echo, with escalation through the garden's increasing chaos and the constellation's spotlight moment. The tension builds appropriately under the accumulative lens through density increases. The release choice carries genuine cost, though the middle section could tighten slightly to maintain pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (protecting family legacy vs. revealing truth) signals early and tightens through Elara's logical proof sequence. Her agency drives the escalation from passive observation to active intervention, with visible cost in abandoning years of protective silence. The pressure coheres but lacks a sharp reversal or deeper complication beyond the initial accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (redemption for abandoning her daughter) is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers she can translate her daughter's final cries. The activation ritual and self-tattooing represent agency with visible cost. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the device is found—the path from discovery to forgiveness lacks sufficient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on discovering "meaning in the mess" during the unlearning, with tension building through the group's visible unease and Elara's decision to create the mandala. The interjection represents the primary escalation point, though the resolution toward "tentative peace" lacks a sharp trade-off or foreclosed option that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from Elias's personal mission to the successful transformation of Enforcer-7, with retrocognitive visions adding pressure. The renaming represents agency that forecloses the automaton's pure enforcement role, though the lack of immediate resistance or complication during the ritual reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (escaping despair) is clear, and pressure builds through the accumulation of temporal echoes and shared memories. However, escalation lacks a meaningful tightening—Elara's transformation happens too easily without forcing difficult choices or visible trade-offs, and the resolution feels given rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—bridging communication gaps in their relationship—escalates from Alex's initial skepticism through telepathic overwhelm to collaborative light-painting resolution. The somatic marker discovery provides a meaningful tightening that changes tactics. However, the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without sustained pressure in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes center on Elara's drive to map the unknown, which intensifies through fossil discovery and its floating. However, no meaningful opposition or cost emerges - the fossil cooperates perfectly, the caves pose no danger, and her mapping succeeds without trade-offs. The "extraordinary" floating moment lacks tension since it aligns with her goals.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophesied collapse—escalates through tremors shaking the rafters, the prophecy slab humming and cracking, to the cliffs groaning in release. The accumulative pressure builds as each cataloged button reveals wisdom ("weave," flood defiance, lovers' dreams) that transforms the prophecy. Cost is visible in Eland's years of solitary work and the "raw possibility" requiring shared wisdom rather than individual force.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build through accumulation: from solitary waiting to reunion to collaborative encoding, with the snow's impermanence adding urgency. The dominant stake (repairing the burned network) tightens when they must trust this ephemeral medium. Cost is legible in accepting the transient nature of their solution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true promise before time runs out—is signaled early through the rain gutter timeframe. Pressure accumulates through the textural revelation of each palimpsest layer (loyalty, wealth-sharing, revenge). However, the resolution lacks a moment where Elias must choose between competing interpretations or face genuine opposition to his discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (understanding persistence) deepens through the timeline revelation, shifting from physical journey to metaphysical understanding. However, escalation under the accumulative lens could intensify more - the "thrum" and timeline navigation lack visceral pressure or meaningful obstacles that would force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes emerge clearly: protecting vulnerable bioluminescent creatures from predators and harsh light. Pressure accumulates through the "quivering hush" and Elara's exposed vulnerability on open water. The ritual's precision—each prism adjustment must be exact—creates tension, though the absence of immediate opposition or complication keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of transforming isolation into independence escalates through the "brittle awakenings" intensifying from gentle memory to "cracking open like eggshells," with clear cost in the fragility metaphor. The stone circle's hum building to vibrate "through her bones" provides accumulative pressure. Deduction for the resolution feeling slightly predetermined rather than fought for in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking connection after years of ghostwriting for others—is clear early. The installation represents agency through public action rather than private writing. However, escalation relies on Mira's coincidental appearance rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and her instant recognition/response lacks the friction that would create genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (preventing community violence) is clear, but escalation is minimal—Elara simply executes her plan without meaningful obstacles or reversals. The tricksters never adapt or counter-strike; they just "recoil" and retreat. No genuine tightening occurs; the resolution arrives through straightforward technical competence without forcing difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: claustrophobia pressing → compass alignment → organ's ghostly notes → spatial expansion → key revelation. The dominant stake (overcoming confinement to find the key) tightens when "doubt crept in" before the organ responds. Cost manifests in accepting the loss of his "confined world," though the transformation feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—solving the cold case to awaken empathy—progresses through investigation beats, with the ribbon discovery tightening focus. The internal conflict between detachment and connection provides pressure. However, escalation remains mostly intellectual rather than visceral, and the lack of active opposition or time pressure limits urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (reversing Harlan's exile) is clear, with escalation through the discovery process narrowing Elara's options toward a specific action. However, the actual cost remains largely anticipated rather than paid on-page—the story ends with intention rather than consequence, limiting the pressure's full realization.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes center on Elias's need for redemption from past failures, signaled through "bridges he'd burned." The scaffold wrap revelation deepens understanding and offers a path forward. However, escalation is passive—Elias observes rather than acts under pressure, and the amnesty arrives without struggle or trade-off, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths circle back—develops through the startup's rise and fall, but Victor's arrival feels like external imposition rather than earned escalation. The territorial marking resolution shows agency and creates a meaningful deepening, yet the threat lacks sufficient buildup and the cost of choosing non-violence over confrontation remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to understand shared burdens—remains consistent but static. Thorne's telegram creates urgency, and the dream sequence provides the story's single meaningful tightening when they decode together. However, escalation reads more as revelation than pressure; Elara faces no genuine obstacles or trade-offs in helping Thorne.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through expanding circles that deepen pressure: first circle reveals lost relics, second draws her deeper to the frozen confession, third forces her into the deadly vortex. The dominant stake—retrieving the confession to lift the curse—faces mounting physical danger (lashing trees, acidic bursts) and emotional cost (unbending her guardedness). Agency drives the resolution through deliberate planting of the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through scar-linking progression: individual connection → network formation → covenant revelation → unbinding choice. The cost sharpens from abstract seeking to concrete risk ("sever ties to the glade, risking her very essence"). One meaningful deepening that reweights options, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear dominant stake established early - healing her brother's war-shattered soul. Escalation builds through the Keeper's warning about the "steep price" to Elara accepting she'll "inherit a shadow of his torment." The cost is legible on page as she feels "the trammel take hold" and threads of her essence patch his fate. Agency drives the resolution through her deliberate choice to trade despite knowing the price.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of rediscovering purpose after loss is signaled early and tightens when Jack recognizes the speaker cloth from Echo Valley's farewell show. The internal pressure escalates from general malaise to specific recognition to decisive action. The final choice forecloses his current path as an appraiser. However, Earl's presence doesn't create meaningful external pressure, and the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure accumulates through grief's weight and the ritual's uncertainty, culminating in the knowledge fruit's revelation. However, escalation lacks meaningful tightening—the seed simply works as hoped without complication or trade-off, missing the resistance that would make success feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against endless routine—is declared early but faces no genuine test or complication. The fusion ritual succeeds without resistance; the identities merge smoothly after a single incantation. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens; the ritual simply completes as expected without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—connection versus isolation—develops through Elias's discovery and the confession ritual, with one meaningful deepening as he moves from inspector to participant. The pearl's accumulating power provides textural escalation. However, the transformation feels too smooth; there's no genuine resistance or complication to his acceptance of the pearl's power.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need for self-forgiveness—intensifies from his unmedicated rawness through discovering the graffiti's wisdom to playing the accordion in acceptance. The escalation follows the textural lens as accumulated river/flood metaphors deepen until "Rivers don't regret their floods; they carve new maps to the sea" triggers his insight. The cost is legible in his permanent loss and ongoing navigation of guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on documenting the unspoken words before the second letter arrives, with escalation through the watch's temporal manipulation creating genuine risk ("one wrong move could trap her in an eternal loop"). The cyclical reversal mechanism provides coherent pressure, though the resolution lacks a decisive trade-off—Elara gets what she wants without meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of choosing between personal freedom and empire's fate creates genuine pressure, with the amulet's dimming light providing urgency. However, the resolution through "perforating" destiny to have both feels too convenient, lacking the full weight of sacrifice even though the "hidden garden" compromise suggests limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Tension builds through Thorne's ebbing life creating urgency for the capture ritual, with stakes clear in preserving essence "before oblivion." The emerald warming and pulsing provides tactile escalation. However, the ritual proceeds without complication or reversal—Elara's expertise faces no meaningful obstacle that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of finding contentment's source progresses through Elara's tree-climbing reflection to the scalloping ritual, with Lir's resistance providing complication. However, the resolution arrives too easily—Lir's transformation lacks dramatized struggle, and the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt through concrete loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Mara's family truth to Elias confronting his own hollow existence, with the wind chimes' "harmonious chord" affirming the choice. However, the tightening relies heavily on symbolic interpretation rather than concrete pressure that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake - teaching "vanishing to appear" - remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs; the stone-throwing demonstration and ring patterns don't raise costs or narrow options. Lir's frustration provides minor friction but resolves without consequence when Elara simply explains.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (restoring the wandering pulse) is clear but never faces on-page test or escalation. The skimmer's appraisal through bird patterns represents method rather than rising pressure, and no cost manifests beyond patient observation. The conflict remains entirely conceptual without a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding genuine wonder amid mechanical mimicry—is signaled early and maintained. The story tightens once when Elowen commits to seeking the keystone, but the journey lacks meaningful resistance or complication under the Accumulative lens. The final transformation of the chamber shows agency and cost, but middle escalation remains thin without obstacles that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest to perceive sound's color—escalates from contemplation through purposeful action to underwater discovery. The cost manifests as physical risk (diving at night) and the irreversible transformation of perception. The accumulative pressure builds effectively though the middle section could tighten between decision and dive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation occurs through the distillation process—from casting lots to receiving static bursts to extracting the backwards prophecy—with stellar doubt intensifying as revelations unfold. The dominant stake (discovering purpose in universal contraction) tightens when the prophecy reveals her role as guardian/catalyst. However, the resolution lacks a decisive trade-off or visible price beyond what was already established.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as each crystallized fear ("Despair's Grasp," "Void's Whisper," "Fate's Shackle") builds pressure toward transformation. The cost appears in "heartbreak eased fractionally" though the escalation could tighten further through more resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clear (restore cosmic balance) and pressure builds through accelerating drip rates, but escalation is purely mechanical—counting drops, heating metal, matching rhythms. The protagonist never faces a genuine reversal or choice that would test his commitment; success arrives through patient execution rather than meaningful struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming buried memory into shared legacy—is signaled early and deepens through the photograph trail. Escalation occurs through accumulation as each photo increases personal stakes, culminating in the father revelation. However, the resolution lacks a dramatized moment of genuine risk or trade-off; gathering descendants and telling stories meets no resistance or complication, reducing the felt cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—infusing the crystal with wonder—is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure since the transformation proceeds smoothly once the starlings appear. No meaningful tightening occurs; the flame manifests easily and the crystal transforms without resistance or complication. The "single tear" suggests emotional cost but arrives without prior struggle to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from platform fractures to evacuation crisis to trust preservation, with Elara's agency driving the resolution through inventive revision. The updraft complication forces meaningful adaptation of the original plan. Cost is visible in the risk to community trust and the physical danger of the revised parachute-tether strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness through custody of identity) is signaled early and escalates through the trial structure. The clone's challenge creates genuine pressure that narrows options from confrontation to necessary unity. The blade's pretense-slicing reveals hidden fears, creating a reversal that shifts tactics. Cost is visible in the loss of individual identity, though the emotional price of merger could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (saving his struggling business through innovation) is clear, and pressure accumulates through the seed's mystery pushing Elias toward creative breakthrough. However, escalation relies on internal speculation rather than dramatized obstacles, and the resolution arrives through convenient inspiration without testing his commitment through genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring family joy—remains clear throughout with escalation through nightly persistence and accumulating effects. The "maceration" metaphor effectively captures the gentle breaking down of grief barriers. Cost is visible in Elias's eternal vigil and the family's gradual opening requires confronting buried pain. Slight deduction for predictable resolution without significant complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of easing dimensional homesickness through befriending uncertainty is clear, with escalation through the ritual's deepening stages. The guardian's agency drives the interiorization process, and cost appears in accepting possible permanent exile. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful resistance; the transformation proceeds too smoothly without complications that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through five successive approximation attempts, each failure informing the next approach, with the curse's weight pressing harder as Elias progresses. The cost is visible through repeated destruction and the physical/emotional toll ("wiped sweat from his brow"). However, the final breakthrough lacks a precipitating pressure change—the fifth attempt succeeds through clarity rather than earned tactical adjustment, slightly weakening the escalation's causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding renewal in endings—is signaled early and tested through the tuning sequence. Escalation occurs through methodical discarding of assumptions that brightens the fragment's response. However, the resolution arrives too easily through visions without meaningful resistance or trade-off, lacking the foreclosed option that would demonstrate true cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping temporal limbo—is clear, and pressure increases from clock distortion to vanishing to being trapped in the grotto. However, Elias faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; his optimism and actions succeed without cost or complication. The resolution comes too easily through broadcasting the right frequency, lacking the foreclosed options or visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic as weaving patterns intensify manifestations: first his sister's laugh echoes, then her face emerges, then she speaks, culminating in the "serene unraveling" where connections erupt upward. The dominant stake—discovering connection's texture—tightens as manifestations grow more tangible, with cost visible in the final dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (learning starlight navigation) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation—Elias simply works until he succeeds without obstacles or reversals. No genuine pressure forces hard choices. The "somber marvel" emotional tone substitutes for actual conflict, and the resolution arrives through straightforward technical success rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices from being unheard—escalates from detecting the signal to tracking it to delivering the message, with Elara sacrificing her own quest. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as details compound. However, the resolution relies partially on coincidence (finding the exact photograph, the woman still being alive), and the cost, while present, could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal timeframe creates genuine urgency, and Alex's phobia escalates appropriately through the narrowing spaces. Yet the central conflict resolves through following the codex's instructions rather than meaningful character choice under pressure. The souls' liberation lacks a moment where Alex must sacrifice or choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—extracting wisdom from Elara's digital ghost—progresses through clear steps but lacks genuine resistance or complication. The defragmentation succeeds without meaningful obstacles, and Alex's internal conflict resolves too smoothly. While his heartbeat counting shows anxiety, no external or internal force genuinely threatens the ritual's success or forces difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the language before extinction—faces escalating pressure through generational loss and the tunnel's madness-inducing dangers. The storyteller's agency drives the resolution through deliberate risk-taking with the cursed diamond. Cost is visible in both the language's death and the physical/mental toll ("copper veins thrumming with residual energy"), though the personal price could be more dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming what was lost through studying cryptids) is clear, but escalation remains largely internal until the sudden transformation. The phone confession doesn't sufficiently tighten pressure—it jumps directly to metamorphosis without intermediate resistance or struggle that would make the cost feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty versus mechanical control—is established early and escalates as Elara's music increasingly disrupts the statues' programming. The tightening occurs when she intensifies her playing despite the risk, with visible cost in the statues' destruction. However, the opposition lacks adaptation; the statues merely "pause" and "tilt" without mounting counter-pressure or forcing Elara to adjust tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—reuniting families across a militarized border—with escalation through the approaching sentinel drones that force Elias to deploy his thunderstorm. However, the resolution lacks a significant trade-off or visible price; the thunderstorm works perfectly and resets without consequence, missing the deeper cost that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elias moves deeper into the train, discovers the oasis, finds the halo fragment, and finally sings—each beat tightening the mystical atmosphere. The cost manifests in his "silence forever altered," though the stakes could intensify if we felt what he risks losing alongside what he gains.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen as analog memories awaken through geometric mapping, building from sketching curves to silk warming to embedded verses revealing. The escalation follows the accumulative lens appropriately, though the discovery lacks a sharper trade-off or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering a lost dream—intensifies from passive longing to active pursuit once the palette appears, with the sunrise photography forcing commitment. The journey to the nexus islet and the tearful photography session show escalating emotional cost. However, the opposition remains entirely internal, and the resolution through magical photography lacks concrete obstacles or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—freeing Mira's trapped idea—and pressure builds through disorientation and visions. The transformation moment shows agency as Elias offers the hair as key. However, the conflict lacks genuine obstacles; once he places the hair, success feels inevitable without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (recovering memories) is clear but escalation is minimal - she descends, studies patterns, presses mushroom, receives memories. The revelation that memories weren't truly stolen but held "in escrow" deflates the established conflict. No meaningful tightening or cost emerges from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear - Kael's reversible exile requires earning return through resilience. The tea reading and shadow demonstration create escalation toward confronting his past. However, the actual confrontation happens in summary ("confronted his past") rather than dramatized scene, weakening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a dulling world—is established early and maintained throughout. However, escalation is minimal; Elowen faces no opposition or complication in her quest. The ritual proceeds smoothly without reversals or tightening pressure, and the resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits through confronting buried truth—is signaled early and escalates through the net's resistance and spectral voices emerging. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as family complicity transforms the task from technical restoration to moral reckoning. Cost is visible in Elara's trembling hands and the spirits' "mute agony," though the resolution feels slightly too neat for the complexity established.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation accumulates through pattern recognition: indentations suggest buried artifacts, light forms "ephemeral shapes," and rhythmic vibrations reveal the henge as "living echo." The dominant stake of interpreting silence deepens when Elias discovers the portal requires empathetic seeing rather than excavation, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on understanding grief's physics, with escalation through discovering the globe, untangling wires, finding Earhart's transmission, then the note. Cost appears in "letting the library fade to shadow" as acceptance. The emotional stakes could pressure choices more directly rather than through discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through storm pressure ("mere seconds before thunder's roar"), with Elowen's encoding racing against time. His agency drives the encoding action that leads to liberation. Cost is visible in the unraveling from the machine and foreclosure of his ghostly existence, though Lira's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating diary revelations that reweight Elias's understanding, from cipher-breaking to discovering the architect's love story to the ritual instructions. The dominant stake—finding meaning in isolation—tightens as each floor reveals deeper parallels to Elias's own loss, though the final choice lacks immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—escalates through accumulative categorization until clouds rush to form Mira's face, a meaningful deepening that reweights all prior observation. Cost is visible in Elias's tears and the ephemeral nature of the vision. However, the conflict lacks oppositional pressure; Elias faces no resistance beyond his own doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—creating the masterpiece before demolition—established early with "condemned" and "dawn" creating time pressure. The fractal patterns escalate conflict as "endless recursion" mirrors her face blindness: "where did one layer end and another begin?" Cost manifests in accepting limitation rather than achieving the infinite.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on Elias's desire to make "the next great discovery," with pressure building through pattern recognition rather than external conflict. The progression from observation to decoding shows meaningful deepening, but lacks genuine risk or cost. The resolution arrives through intellectual breakthrough without testing commitment or forcing trade-offs that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—progresses through discovery of prophecy scraps to the uncapping action, with escalation via the accumulation of fragments and visions. However, there's no real opposition or complication; Elara simply follows instructions to achieve her goal. The cost feels more nostalgic than urgent, lacking the pressure that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared (planet's core destabilizing) but never create genuine pressure—the group faces no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs in reaching their solution. The bell-ringing climax occurs without opposition or cost; everyone simply agrees and succeeds. No escalation under any lens; the conflict resolves through following instructions rather than navigating genuine difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transmitting the lullaby across time—is signaled early and deepens through the nested patterns discovery. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressured; Elias faces no opposition or complication, just methodical execution of his ritual. The cost ("delay the end, but never avert it") stays abstract rather than forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The night frost deadline creates clear ticking pressure, and the pilgrims' arrival forces action. Escalation builds from discovery to assembly to successful guidance, with the mechanical birds as constant threat. However, the resolution feels slightly too smooth—the pilgrims escape just as frost forms without significant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting with Lila) escalates from observation to insight to concrete action, with Elena's creation of the sculpture foreclosing her path of isolation. The cost accumulates through "years ago" choices and "fractured" relationships, though the actual resistance or difficulty in reconnection happens mostly off-page through Lila's "tentative" response rather than dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - finding where stories begin - escalates through the moonlight incision revealing the map, then the descent to the guarded core requiring Elara to sacrifice her identity. The "narrative fragments, jagged shards" provide resistance, but this guardian appears late without prior setup, weakening the earned quality of the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake - confronting stored remorse from betraying a lover - is signaled early and maintains coherence. The tightening occurs when Elias must risk absorbing the remorse to transform it. However, the escalation feels predetermined rather than genuinely pressured, and the resolution arrives too smoothly without visible struggle or meaningful obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—bridging isolated communities—is clear but develops through Elara's actions without meaningful opposition or escalating pressure. The grain elevators' "talks" present a problem she solves methodically without facing trade-offs or resistance. No force complicates her rehabilitation efforts or tests her resolve with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake - becoming an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" - remains largely abstract throughout. The story presents internal meditation rather than escalating pressure; Elias faces no meaningful opposition or tightening constraints, just voluntary memory work that could theoretically continue indefinitely without forcing a decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (finding forgotten combinations) is signaled early and the gravity inversion creates a ticking clock. However, escalation is minimal—Elara encounters one seed of vigilance that she easily deflects with the manuscript. The story lacks meaningful tightening; she navigates obstacles without genuine struggle or forcing difficult trade-offs that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (creating music in silence) established early and deepens through discovering the sculpture holds the key. The strumming sequence shows meaningful escalation from "nothing happened" to "faint hum" to full resonance. Cost is visible in the emotional weight and the world's response. Slightly limited by lack of concrete opposition or trade-off beyond internal doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as Elias correlates increasingly complex silences—from the king's betrayal to his own exile to universal patterns. The moon's phase creates genuine time pressure. However, the conflict remains entirely internal without external opposition, and the resolution comes through meditation rather than dramatized choice with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of cataloging silence to foster empathy progresses through frequency tuning that reveals increasingly intimate truths, from betrayal to loneliness to the final confession. Cost accumulates through emotional revelations, though physical resistance is minimal since the clasp "yields without a click." The conflict remains largely internal without active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (cultivating serenity within motion) is signaled early and tested through the corpse flower experiment. The story achieves one meaningful deepening when the flower's stench erupts and forces village confrontation. However, escalation feels muted - the "turning of the tide's thought" is declared rather than dramatized through increasing pressure, and Elara faces minimal resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (saving the family orchard) is signaled early and the gravity inversion creates time pressure. However, escalation remains largely environmental rather than driven by protagonist agency—Lira follows established navigation methods without meaningful opposition or trade-offs. The discovery itself lacks struggle or visible cost beyond the time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the accident to prevent future disasters—is clear, with escalation through the patch discovery that complicates the drone narrative. However, pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral, lacking urgency or personal cost. The investigation proceeds smoothly without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs, and the resolution doesn't show Mara sacrificing anything or facing resistance to her findings.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict emerges - the ritual proceeds exactly as planned without opposition, reversal, or cost. The "oscillating repose" mentioned doesn't manifest as actual tension. Stakes remain abstract (certifying wonder) without concrete pressure or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—confronting failure to gain wisdom—escalates through the ritual's progression from setup to vision to transformation. The "avalanchingly quiet" atmosphere builds pressure that "crashed inward like a muted avalanche," forcing Elara to face truths. The cost is visible in accepting "humility in guardianship, the folly of isolation." However, the conflict lacks active opposition beyond internal resistance, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding emotion's mathematics—remains consistent but static. Each printing attempt represents progression, yet lacks meaningful tightening or foreclosed options. The halo fragment's introduction promises escalation but its empathy-transposing power manifests as description ("felt the shift") rather than forcing difficult trade-offs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central tension—transforming a fleeting encounter into lasting wonder—escalates through Kael's progression from suspicion to curiosity to transformation, with the pendant's sympathetic vibration serving as the mechanism. The stakes deepen as hours unfold from what should be moments, though the lack of genuine opposition or risk to Elara herself limits the pressure's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (proving emotional absorption) is clear from opening, with Marcus's need for externalized pain as secondary pressure. The prism-frost communion creates one meaningful deepening that shifts Marcus from mockery to belief. Cost appears when Marcus feels his betrayal mirrored, though the escalation could tighten further under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—bridging impossible distance to reach her daughter—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's life-force sacrifice. Yet escalation feels predetermined rather than pressured; the puzzle pieces slot in without resistance, and the ritual proceeds without complication or meaningful choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    While Elar faces the challenge of descending into dangerous shafts and performing the ritual, there's no meaningful resistance or escalating opposition. The awakening occurs without struggle, and his "bartering his unspoken fears" remains abstract rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth about her brother—escalates through Elara's active choice to redirect through parallel universes, with each weave raising the risk of being "lost in the multiverse's infinite echoes." The confrontation with her brother delivers meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible in bearing "the family's shame alone," though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—maintaining safety against the void—escalates when the lamp flickers out, forcing Elias to act under pressure with the ghosts intensifying. His choice to stack stones and place the letter represents agency that forecloses other options (like simply relighting the lamp). The cost appears in the ghosts' peaceful fading and Elias's ongoing commitment, though the resolution feels slightly convenient when the spirits immediately respond to the sea glass without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—Elowen performs her nightly ritual without opposition, complication, or rising pressure. The "ancient shadows" offer no resistance, transforming willingly under her guidance. The story declares stakes about humanity's future but never tests them through concrete conflict or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some magnetize stories—deepens through accumulative revelation as Elias tracks sun trails to carved stories, culminating in seeing his own transformed reflection. The tension between his watchful caution and the donor heart's curiosity provides internal pressure. However, the resolution comes through observation and insight rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding the pin sound to discovering the sextant to using it to map sorrow. The dominant stake—understanding what trees witness—tightens through each discovery. Elias's agency drives the escalation as he chooses to use the sextant despite trembling hands. Cost is legible in "hands aching from the precision" and the emotional toll of deconstructing sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate as "the realm's pulse weaken[s]" and spirits drift apart, building pressure through accumulation. The ritual creates meaningful deepening as forgotten songs intertwine with woven dawns, though the cost remains somewhat abstract until Elara's physical trembling manifests the price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will engage with his past betrayer—develops through his observation and ultimate choice to help anonymously. One meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes the betrayer's hidden remorse. However, escalation is minimal; Elias remains largely passive, observing rather than actively choosing until the final note, and even that gesture carries little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on transforming "normalized neglect" through uncloaking hidden beauty, with Elias's personal absolution as secondary pressure. The mosaic discovery provides meaningful escalation that forces confrontation with his guilt. However, the resolution lacks immediate opposition—the transformation happens without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - preserving history before illusions vanish - creates genuine urgency with "the last shimmer" threatening oblivion. Escalation occurs through increasingly significant vows (unity→protection→guardianship), with the final one "fracturing like shattering ice." However, no meaningful reversal or complication tests Elara's commitment; she succeeds without adaptation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through three false starts that progressively disrupt Thorne's deal while maintaining cover. Each attempt tightens pressure toward the final manipulation where trust audibly breaks. The cost is clear - Elara must work through deception rather than direct confrontation, mirroring the betrayal she seeks to avenge.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding weather-carriers—develops through sensory accumulation as taste changes guide Elara's path. The escalation from bitter to sweet to salty to peppery creates textural pressure. However, the confrontation with the weather-carrier lacks genuine conflict; his immediate explanation deflates tension, and Elara's transformation happens too easily without meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming suppressed creativity) is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers the broken lock on his self-imposed prison. The escalation from finding lock → locating chest → devising artistic solution shows agency, though the resolution comes too easily—the improvised mechanism works perfectly on first try without genuine struggle or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal quest to communal possibility ("ready to share this discovery with Verdantia"). The dominant stake of recovering lost truths tightens through physical descent and emotional revelation. The cost is visible in Elara's tears and the "parched voids" being mended, though the resolution lacks a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) faces meaningful escalation as Elara discovers the iceberg fragment and commits to her "grandest creation," with increasing pressure through winter's approaching muteness. The resolution is earned through her completed sculpture that successfully rekindles wonder. Cost is legible in her seasonal silence becoming the price for creating eternal harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from internal static to dome collapse to forced evacuation, with the magnetic shift creating genuine time pressure. The controlled burn escape carries clear risk and cost. However, the miniaturization solution arrives somewhat conveniently without sufficient prior setup, weakening the earned quality of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (proving listening heals) accumulates through three distinct storytelling encounters that build toward the mailbox opening. Each story deepens understanding and leads to the next clue. However, the resolution lacks genuine tension - no one resists the healing, making the outcome feel predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through "spider-web days" of methodical dice rolls and dance interpretations, with the dominant stake (escape/liberation) signaled early. The escalation through journal entries and nightly dice rolls creates textural density, though the final liberation lacks a visible cost—Elara simply inputs the code and succeeds without trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from routine lantern lighting to the chamber's amplified gravity fluctuations to the coffee grounds revealing the memory map. The cost is legible in Elias's original choice to delete painful memories and his current navigation of gravity anomalies. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grounds reveal he chose his own deletion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing prophetic cataclysm—is declared early but never tested through concrete opposition or complication. The ritual proceeds without meaningful resistance, reversal, or tightening of options. While the prophecy's "whispered secrets" provide nominal tension, Elias faces no actual obstacles that would force adaptation or reveal cost through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from borrowing sugar to weekly lessons to confrontation under meteors, with Elias's interrogation forcing Mira's confession. The dominant stake (learning the building's language) tightens when doubt forces the rooftop confrontation. Cost is visible when pressing the seal makes the building speak.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (transforming isolation into independence) signals early and tightens through the timeframe constraint. Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: whispers→murmurs→symphony, with Elara's agency driving the archive ritual. The cost is legible (releasing skeptical defenses, accepting connection). However, the guardian spirit provides minimal active opposition, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on completing the unfinished rebellion through the final forged document. The unlinking sequence provides one meaningful deepening as Elara realizes the key works "not by force, but by understanding." However, the resolution lacks active opposition or meaningful trade-offs—the vault opens too smoothly once she solves the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake - understanding why some voices echo - drives consistent pressure through progressive disclosure. Escalation occurs as Elara moves from seeking to confronting Thorne, with the seashell pieces creating tangible tension. However, the final confrontation lacks sufficient cost; Elara's victory through song feels unearned without established struggle or sacrifice beyond emotional understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from seeking "a fragment of untainted soul" to uncovering the captain's betrayal and innocent cabin boy's sacrifice, with the melted globe amplifying ghost communications as pressure mechanism. The cost—eternal unrest for the innocent—is clear, though Elara faces limited personal risk beyond empathetic burden.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered observations—from nets to tea patterns to moon paths—each deepening Elias's understanding. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as his appreciation transforms into a vow to teach others. However, the stakes remain primarily internal and philosophical without external resistance or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from debunking a curse to discovering exploitable science that could "reclaim pockets of the wasteland." The dominant stake—truth versus comfortable lies—tightens when Elias realizes exposing this would "shatter the lies people clung to." Cost becomes visible as he weighs salvation against doom, though the final choice remains suspended.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal isolation to prophetic responsibility as "pilgrims braved the cloud-shrouded paths." The dominant stake—using ancient shadows to shape renewal—remains consistent but abstract. While pressure accumulates through intensifying visions and growing followers, the story lacks a concrete moment where Elias must choose between competing goods or pay a specific price for his prophetic role.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational gaps through preserved sounds—is signaled early. The story deepens this through the music box discovery and sound-combining act, but lacks meaningful tightening or pressure increase. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through escalating tension or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes escalate from protecting the artifact to Elias becoming its conduit, with the intruders' arrival forcing immediate action. The sonic barrier creation shows meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the intruders' threat dissolves too easily—"threat dissolved" reads as convenient rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal restraint to collective action as Elara transforms the exiles' raw fury into strategic patience, culminating in the viaduct activation. The rain's awakening of the viaduct provides the catalyst for action. While the revolution's launch carries weight, the regime remains abstract, slightly dampening the opposition's force.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (breaking free from spectral control) is clear, and pressure builds through accumulating visions and the reverberating hum. However, Elena's agency feels limited—she mostly observes until the convenient incantation, and the resolution lacks a meaningful trade-off or visible price beyond abstract "liberation."

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether forgiveness is deserved—intensifies through Lena's direct question and the shared reading of Theo's letter, with meaningful cost in both characters' transformations. The escalation follows clear causal links from confrontation to mutual understanding, though the resolution through the letter feels somewhat neat given the years of carried anger.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—creating meaning in a dissolving world—is signaled early but escalation remains conceptual rather than pressured. The algorithm's evolution from "crude steam belchers to sentient mechanisms" provides accumulative deepening but no genuine obstacles threaten failure. The final bell-ringing lacks earned triumph because no real opposition was overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about patterns to risking corporate review through deception to racing against self-erasing files. The AI detection creates genuine time pressure that forces Elara's panicked download. Cost manifests clearly when evidence vanishes, leaving only memory—though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and system detection.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform empathy into actionable unity before the Council's verdict—tightens through the reconstitution process as each mirror reveals deeper community fractures. The escalation from passive waiting to active tool-creation shows agency, though the Council's horn arriving just as she completes the orb feels slightly convenient. Cost appears in the risk of acting without approval and the weight of intervening "where others awaited fate."

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: volunteer boat capsizing, gale-force winds fracturing ice, reality slipping "entirely." The cost manifests in Elara's transformed state—no longer seeking death but "anchored in the marina's frozen embrace," though the middle lacks a sharp pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure accumulates through the sharing of parallel losses, with Mira's guarded expression softening as recognition builds. The cost is legible—both accept their mismatch while savoring fleeting connection—but escalation remains gentle without a decisive turn that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the prophet's wisdom before it fades—drives Elar from the pavilion through the conjured clearing to the consecration. Pressure builds through the prophet's disruption creating unstable magical clearings and awakening the ancient parapet. The consecration ritual represents agency through deliberate action with visible effect, though the opposition remains mostly environmental rather than actively contested.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"collective healing" and "transmuting pain" never face concrete opposition or require trade-offs. The villagers arrive and participate without resistance, and Elara's work proceeds without meaningful obstacles. No tightening occurs; the process unfolds smoothly from intention to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering if language can still grow) is signaled early and deepens through the crystal's revelations. However, escalation remains primarily internal without external pressure forcing harder choices. The "heresy" of growth creates theoretical risk but no immediate antagonistic force tests Elias's commitment. The resolution shows agency through his decision to share quietly, but lacks the visible price or foreclosed option that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elias moves from chalk symbols to driftwood paths to the hollow's discovery, with each action narrowing his search pattern. The vision that "vanished, leaving only an echo of sorrow" demonstrates cost, though the piece could heighten the stakes of failure or the price of his forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through foundation tremors threatening Elias's life work, with the spinning clock hand embodying chaos against his need for permanence. The leaf's fall provides the decisive deepening moment that enables resolution. Cost is visible in accepting his wife's loss and transforming grief, though middle-section pressure could tighten more explicitly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes established immediately with "days remaining" diagnosis, tightening through Elara's intervention and culminating in father-daughter reconciliation. The cost is legible in decades of estrangement and the broken vinyl representing shattered family. Escalation follows accumulative pattern as memories layer and the hymning builds. Minor deduction for coincidental timing of daughter's availability.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—restore reality by understanding shadows—and pressure builds through sequential loop closures revealing deeper truths. The escalation from wind whispers to ancient spirits to personal shadow confrontation follows the accumulative lens. However, the cost remains primarily intellectual until the final beat; earlier loops lack visible prices that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming past trauma into meaning—deepens through the maze journey and discovery of the changeling's tooth. The fusion ritual represents a meaningful tightening where Elara must accept her daughter's fate to achieve peace. However, the resolution lacks immediate dramatic pressure; the ritual succeeds without complication or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulative pattern: from kneeling contemplation to active polishing to weighing doubt to final release. Each memory surge ("fiery descents," "worlds lit ablaze," "stars weeping") raises the emotional cost of her past failures, making the gentle solution more urgent. The weighing moment creates genuine tension about whether small acts can redeem cosmic harm.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to transform trauma into resilience—is clear early but lacks escalating pressure. The icicle patterns deepen her understanding but don't force harder choices until the young man appears. His arrival provides the only real turn, and while the pendant exchange carries weight, the conflict resolution feels too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through increasingly difficult hope collections, with the current strengthening and nexus beasts appearing as obstacles. Each collection requires greater effort ("muscles straining," "edges cutting into his skin"). However, the individual hope encounters lack distinct tactical variation, and the final act of crushing the seashell, while decisive, arrives without sufficient pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate clearly from personal belief to active ritual to successful restoration, with the harvest moon's rare alignment creating genuine time pressure. The dominant stake (preserving the arbor before it fades entirely) faces concrete test through Elias's singing ritual. Cost is visible in the arbor's initial decay and the risk of permanent loss if the ritual fails, though internal resistance could deepen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The eclipse creates temporal pressure that escalates through Elara's patient waiting to the precise moment of alignment, with her endurance tested by "biting cold." The cost is visible in consumed starlight and physical toll, though the stakes could intensify more dramatically as the eclipse peaks rather than maintaining steady accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through echo harvest—is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation reads as methodical progress rather than tightening pressure; Elias faces no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would force harder choices or reveal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate as each collected burden paradoxically tightens the weaver's own trap while providing the means for escape. The accumulation of calcified weights builds pressure toward the final meta-pattern that breaks her prison. Cost is visible in both the travelers' relief and the weaver's increasing confinement until the climactic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake of transforming grief into tangible form escalates through progressive carving details—mane, eyes, paw—each revealing deeper emotional layers. The kettle's whistle provides temporal pressure. Cost is visible but somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally felt in "lessons harvested not in bitterness."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on Elara confronting her eroded ambitions through ghost negotiation. The carousel's halt creates urgency, and collecting fragments builds pressure adequately. However, the ghost confrontation lacks tangible cost—no specific option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid when ambitions are "reshaped."

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting hope from abandonment—develops through Elara's progressive discoveries and engineering solutions. Escalation occurs as she moves from observation to active intervention, with the water redirection serving as the key turning point. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition or cost; everything succeeds too smoothly without meaningful resistance or trade-offs that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake - making peace with abandoned artistic dreams - is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through accumulative intensity as memories and whispers build toward acceptance. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful obstacles; Elias simply arrives, kneels, listens, and achieves resolution without substantive resistance or cost beyond feeling his regret.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (understanding deception vs. being deceived) escalates from abstract contemplation to physical action (diving) to intellectual revelation. The cost is legible in Elias's recognition that even his discovery is another layer of deception. However, the pressure doesn't fully tighten as the revelation comes through reading rather than active choice, and the "serene upheaval" tone dampens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from seeking mythical beings through patient decoding to actual contact and exchange. The dominant stake—preserving ancient cultivation methods—faces concrete test when Elias must trade his precious fulgurite. However, the weaver's immediate acceptance lacks resistance that would heighten the negotiation's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding Mira's absence through projection—coheres throughout. Escalation occurs through the deepening of the ritual as the thread warms and creates "luminous pathways." However, the conflict remains largely internal without significant tightening or reversal, and the cost (continued solitude) was present from the start rather than newly incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of reviving beauty is clear, but escalation reads more as accumulation of description than genuine pressure—Elandor assembles the cradle without meaningful obstacles or choices that narrow his options. The cost at closure (accepting imperfection) exists conceptually but doesn't arise from protagonist agency confronting opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and tested through the grafting action, with visible cost in Elara's nightly returns to tend the sapling. However, escalation is minimal; the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful obstacles, proceeding smoothly from intention to fulfillment without the tightening or deepening that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from observation (following breadcrumbs) through patient waiting to active intervention (using her glow's heat), with each stage narrowing options. The "sidereal patience" moment effectively dramatizes endurance as agency. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily—her theory about heat works perfectly on first attempt, reducing the sense of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening—from "troubling serenity" to "creeping entropy" to final revelation of "loops that approximated infinity but begged for divergence." The stake (breaking generational patterns) remains consistent but the resolution lacks agency cost; the young beings stir and unfold without Elowen paying a visible price for intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic frustration to understanding familial and collective grief patterns, with the ribbon-weaving and butterfly migration creating physical manifestation of abstract concepts. The ghost's mentorship applies consistent pressure that forces Elias to abandon his solitary approach. Cost is visible in his shift from individual names to abstract patterns, though the resolution feels slightly too harmonious.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on restoring communal balance after the accident fractured village unity. The pressure builds through Elias's incremental confession ritual, though escalation remains largely internal. The pendulum's pause creates a meaningful tightening moment, but the resolution's ease (mystical transference instantly healing the village) undercuts earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure accumulates through the tapestry's decoding process, with echoes crescendoing as truth emerges. The stakes deepen from curiosity to redemptive responsibility, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without testing Elias's blithe nature against darker possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The frozen lake presents a clear constraint but no actual escalation or tightening occurs—Elara merely contemplates possibilities without testing them. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no deepening that changes knowledge. The story remains in stasis from beginning to end without any pressure point that forces choice or crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal vow to pirate broadcast to teaching dust itself - each step raises risk and scope. The dominant stake (reviving stories) tightens when Elias must "cloak the stories in layers of misdirection." However, no direct opposition appears on-page; pressure comes from implied surveillance rather than dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving ephemeral emotion—faces escalation through the chair stopping (time pressure) and the powder's "cruel twist" of temporary crystallization. Cost is visible in Elias's physical decline and ultimate dissolution, though the woman's subplot doesn't generate additional pressure on the main conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through deepening layers both physical and philosophical, from surface narratives to underground whispers to Elias's "third path." The chronometer cog discovery crystallizes his conflict between competing interpretations, though the final ascent feels slightly abrupt without showing how he'll challenge the narratives above.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (vanishing arts, town discord) but escalation lacks genuine pressure—each session proceeds without setbacks or meaningful resistance. The "breakthrough" with the weeping elder arrives without earned causality, and no visible price is paid for the harmony achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming erased memories) established early and tightens through the pruning sequence. The celestial alignment creates temporal pressure. Cost is legible when Elias confronts his family's loss. Some deduction for convenience in how easily the rebellion spreads through "whispers."

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes establish clearly—city-wide blackout threatens routine life—and escalate through the riddle's challenge to find and activate the lacquer box. However, Elara faces minimal opposition; the riddle solves easily and the box works immediately upon opening. Cost exists conceptually (over-reliance drained wonder) but lacks immediate dramatic pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on understanding the living houses before "normality crept too far, erasing the wonder." The ritual with displaced objects provides escalation, but tension plateaus rather than tightens—Elias encounters no meaningful resistance or cost beyond abstract revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate clearly through three revelations that progressively challenge Elara's worldview, from her father's hidden regrets to the city's fall from certainty to her own capacity for forgiveness. The ampoule's insertion through the structural weakness provides agency-driven escalation with visible cost in Elara's "trembling hands." The final transformation shows clear price paid in surrendering her rigid beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on escaping through understanding perpetual motion, with one clear tightening when the proof causes the tremor. However, escalation remains intellectual rather than visceral - equations build but physical/emotional pressure doesn't mount. The resolution arrives through mathematical completion without dramatized struggle or visible trade-off beyond intellectual effort.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on proving kindness endures through reviving lost languages, with escalation from private painting to public distribution. The waxing moon creates temporal pressure for his work, though the conflict remains largely internal without external opposition testing his belief—the transformation happens but lacks a decisive tightening that would force harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving cultural identity versus immediate survival—escalates from whispers of dwindling supplies to the frozen spring crisis that forces action. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her bread-baking plan that addresses both physical (thawing) and cultural (binding) needs. The cost is visible in the "fragile victory" and the shadow of the beekeeper's absence, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without a significant reversal or deeper complication.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reversing time to save his family—is established early and tightens as Elias discovers the yoyo can harness the hunger stone's power. The escalation follows clear causal steps: discovery → examination → reverse-engineering → activation, with the cost being Elias's entry into a "reversed reality" where certainty dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias confronting his fear of abandonment—is established early and escalates through the paradoxical confessions. The cost appears in his forced vulnerability, though the resolution feels somewhat mechanical as fear simply "unravels like smoke" without significant struggle or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The leeward tide threat escalates from atmospheric unease to concrete whirlpools, with the prophet's response transforming obstacles into a symphony. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each instrument adds to the harmonic defense. However, the resolution feels too smooth—the tide simply "harmonizes" without visible struggle or trade-off at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from mapping patterns to committing sacrilege to confronting deadly watchers, with each step narrowing options. The forbidden shell-cracking carries immediate cost ("irreversible choice"). However, the scroll's revelations arrive through summary rather than dramatized discovery, and the final confrontation begins rather than completes on the page, limiting the visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (exposing truth vs. preserving noble lies) is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. Elias finds the letter without obstacle, makes his plan without resistance, and walks away without paying a price—the conflict remains entirely internal and abstract without meaningful escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: surveying becomes wading, wading becomes wrestling with mud, discovery becomes entombment. The dominant stake—preserving abandoned dreams before repairs erase them—tightens when the locket reveals personal connection, forcing Elias to choose between keeping family history or completing his mission. Cost manifests in the irrevocable sealing of both locket and note.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering lineage truth) escalates when the blackout traps Elara, forcing her to abandon digital tools for tactile memory and venture into dangerous auxiliary vaults. The seismic tremor complicates without resolving. Cost is visible—isolation, risk, confronting uncomfortable truths—though the physical danger could be more immediate during the vault sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into releasable form—is clear from the outset. The basilica sequence provides one meaningful deepening as dreams become tangible wisps that can be folded and released. However, there's no real opposition or complication; the plan works exactly as conceived without meaningful resistance or cost beyond the emotional pain already present.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation—each perturbation reveals more pools until the "ultimate pool" appears over his homeland. The cooldown window creates time pressure, external winds threaten the observatory's stability. Cost is visible in Amir's "bleak exhilaration" and the pools representing "lives unlived, loves unblossomed," though the final touch remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking an abstract frequency to recovering specific missing pieces that unlock belonging. The progression from discovery to assembly creates meaningful tightening. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition—the pilgrim and Elara immediately cooperate, and the drone retrieval faces no obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure accumulates through the ritual of sifting, with the watch hand discovery forcing Elias to confront suppressed memories. The escalation from physical searching to emotional reckoning works under the textural lens. Cost is somewhat abstract—"tempered peace" rather than a more concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake of redemption through flawless execution is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the synchronized arrival of both delegations and the ritualized untethering that could fail at any moment. The resolution is earned through Elias's successful orchestration, though the tension could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (reconciling wanderlust with stability) is signaled early but never faces concrete on-page pressure—his partner has already left, removing immediate conflict. The shift from sea to land navigation represents change but costs nothing tangible; walking toward town requires no sacrifice or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes escalate from following cryptic clues to confronting his capacity for connection, with the baseball as throughline. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition—Alex faces puzzles rather than meaningful resistance, and his transformation occurs through beauty rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear (reuniting with Thorne beyond death), and pressure builds through the reluctant metamorphosis with visible cost in losing human form. The transformation sequence shows agency through Elara's eventual surrender to change. However, escalation feels predetermined rather than driven by active choices, and the fortune cookie's convenient wisdom undercuts earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost time to rebuild family bonds—is clear, and pressure builds through the ritual's resistance ("the cloth resisted, bound by an invisible knot of regret"). However, escalation relies heavily on metaphorical/magical elements rather than concrete opposition. The resolution comes through surrender rather than active struggle, which fits the accumulative lens but reduces dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—opening the locked dimension—and pressure builds through successive photograph encounters. Each shadow integration meaningfully deepens Lira's capacity, culminating in the portal opening. However, the conflicts lack genuine resistance; each shadow yields too easily to stitching, and there's no moment where Lira's pacifism genuinely costs her or forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from personal journey to rescue to communal salvation, with the jar accidentally opening as a meaningful complication. The fissure swallowing the original path creates genuine consequence. The prophecy resolution feels slightly convenient, but Elias's agency in choosing to help Mira and release the bugs drives the outcome with visible cost (his last possessions).

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—redistributing the fort's power through revolution—is clear, with the blackout creating time pressure. However, escalation remains linear without meaningful reversals; the approaching sentinel creates only brief tension before dissolving without consequence, missing an opportunity to force a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through the ritual's mathematical progression as each placed rock intensifies the pattern's emergence, with Elara's visions showing both revelation and ruin. The cost becomes tangible when placing the eighth rock triggers the humming vibrations and she sees her elusiveness will end, though the middle section could tighten its pressure between finding the star dust and beginning the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake - breaking free from censorship - is signaled early and maintained. The storm creates temporal pressure ("when masks slip"), but escalation relies heavily on the discovered map rather than protagonist-driven choices. The transformation of rage into "rarefied" poetry shows agency but lacks intermediate struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear early (exchanging the needle card for philosophical maps), with escalation through the rival's interruption forcing a duel. The cost is visible in physical combat and loss of the artifact. However, the escalation feels somewhat mechanical—the rival arrives precisely when needed without sufficient setup.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elias's transformation from vagrant to rebel, with the molt providing natural escalation as he shifts from passive wanderer to active resistance. The pressure deepens through memory of Jax's execution and culminates in the seed-planting action, though the opposition remains abstract (the regime exists only as backdrop) and no immediate cost manifests beyond the implied future risk.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal longing through the compasses' urgent flickering to the time pressure of "until the horizon invited night," with Elias's agency driving the film-reel entry. The cost lands clearly: "the reel couldn't hold forever; tides would reclaim him," though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovering and using the reel.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from climbing the ridge before monsoon, to entering the dream trance, to interpreting the collective voices, culminating in the seed's accelerated sprouting. The dominant stake (protecting cultural memory before monsoon erosion) tightens as "first distant thunder rumbled." Cost appears in Elara's persistent luminous doubt—she achieves the awakening but cannot know if it's real.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting unspoken apologies—intensifies through the lace instructions that force Elias to actively engage his regret rather than passively suffer it. The cost is legible in his articulation "I should have said I'm sorry" and the subsequent diffusion of pain. The tightening occurs when he must follow the lace's method, narrowing his options to confrontation or continued suffering.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in choosing to observe, which allows the decay to deepen. The cost is unmistakable: the acid-laced dust etches into plant tissues and wood, a visible price that narrows her options and forces her final stance of acceptance. The dominant stake of maintaining control is meaningfully tightened by this gradual, observed erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift: the frost patterns crystallize, leading Elara to the box.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear meaningful tightening as she focuses her emotions. The cost is legible in the projected "reds of passion and blues of sorrow." Points deducted for the heat-mapping method appearing late, slightly reducing its integrated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with Elias's choice to enter the impossible spaces representing a decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, as the tightening sanctions and youth unrest force his hand, culminating in the declaration that narrows his options and exposes him. The cost is legible in his transition from hidden protector to vulnerable leader. The dominant stake of intergenerational unity is tested and deepened credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a single, meaningful cadence shift driven by Elara's agency via the breathing method. This deepens her knowledge and narrows her options, leading to the climactic release. The cost is legible in her tears and the physical flood of emotion. The dominant stake (reclaiming unused love) is tested and resolved with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates masterfully through the increasing intensity and density of the retrocognitive visions. The protagonist's agency is clear in his deliberate use of hyperbolic geometry to force a disintegration. The cost of the fragment's loss is unmistakable and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (protecting the vault) is clear and escalates coherently through the approaching invaders, tightening Elias's options. His agency in decoding the puzzle drives the escalation under the causal lens. The cost is legible in the imminent threat narrowly thwarted, though the external pressure is somewhat monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in collecting absences, tightening under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (finding the sound) is signaled early and tested through the process. Cost is legible in the final emotional release. One meaningful cadence shift is sufficient for this length, though the "cells dividing" element provides less pressure than others.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the Causal lens: Elara's choice to use the jar tightens the situation and changes her knowledge, leading to the final choice. The cost of her old life is felt. A minor deduction as the initial theft via the flower vendor feels slightly less pressured than the subsequent, more personal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (creating sanctuary before the flood) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens through the accelerating thaw and rising water. Protagonist agency is clear in the final choice to leave, which carries a visible cost. The escalation is a single, meaningful intensification perfectly suited to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with Mara's arrival forcing the trap. Cost is legible in Elias's physical and emotional strain during decryption and climbing. One meaningful tightening (Mara's approach) narrows options convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the dimming sky and the protagonist's agency in racing against it. The dominant stake (mapping the night) tightens meaningfully as the last star fades, forcing her final, costly act of preservation. The cost is legible in the drifting gold flakes and the sealing of the book. A hairline deduction for the passive nature of the external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification through the act of playing the violin, which deepens and reweights the dominant stake of seeking enlightenment. The cost is the conceptual price of integration, felt in the thaw and the character's transformation. Agency is clear in the choice to play.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the deepening visions from the concert tickets, which reweight the dominant stake of mistrust. The protagonist's agency in choosing to confront the visitor with transparency drives the final turn. The cost of vulnerability is felt, though the pressure could be more acutely personal before his decisive act; the escalation is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, as Elias's secret interventions create a coherent pressure that tightens the situation. The dominant stake (proving the garden's loyalty) is signaled early and deepens through his calculated acts. The cost is legible on the page in Thorne's erratically dipping amulet and shattered confidence, a direct result of Elias's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (proving the theory) escalates under the causal lens as their experiment successfully demonstrates lateral time but creates a dangerous "temporal eddy." The protagonist's agency drives the escalation, and the cost of nearly being pulled into an alternate reality is clear, forcing the decisive choice to abort.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift from quiet investigation to disruptive sonic assault. This single, meaningful intensification is driven entirely by Elias's agency and reweights the dominant stake, unlocking the ghost's code. The cost is the transformation of the artifact and the resolution of the haunting silence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift from observation to the active, irreversible act of smudging the margins. This action, prompted by Thorne but executed by Elara, narrows her options and forces the truth's revelation with a visible, felt cost—the quantification of her sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the radio calls and ghost manifestation force a reinterpretation that narrows options. The cost is legible in the final release of water and burden. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase in the observed cycles. However, the pressure is largely observational; the protagonist's agency in escalating the central stake of witnessing is passive, relying on the portal's function rather than a active, difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (nurturing wonder) are clear early. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the planned eclipse moment. The cost is legible in Finn's tears and shifted perspective, reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: the probe yields diaries, which yield the tapestry fragment, which yields the core revelation, reweighting the dominant stake from collection to potential restoration. The cost is the conceptual weight of this discovery, though a more visible, personal cost for Elias would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (transposing life) is signaled early and tightens through his decision to act. The cost is legible in the town's revelations. A minor deduction as the resolution for the other characters happens off-page and is summarized, slightly softening the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is masterful—a cadence shift built through layered rhetorical loops and a crucial, abrupt pause. The dominant stake (possession of the anchor) tightens palpably, and the cost of Elias's effort is felt in the entity's lashing out and the sealing of fissures. A single, powerful intensification is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift—the act of mapping memories onto the shell—that reweights the dominant stake. The pressure of the approaching dawn and exhaustion coheres, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is visible in his heavy limbs and the final easing of his affliction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in generating timelines, each deepening stakes and narrowing options. The cost of each failed branch is legible, culminating in the tablet's crack and her final confrontation with the child self.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as Elias's experimentation leads to the pivotal session with Mira. This single, meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake (emotional connection) with unmistakable cost—Mira's tears and his own shared release. The pressure coheres and tightens convincingly, though it relies on a single major turn.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early—integrity versus engagement—and escalate through internal pressure under the accumulative lens. Elias's decision to not act is a meaningful tightening that forecloses an option with cost. However, the external follower element is underutilized, creating a minor imbalance where declared stakes (the follower) don't fully materialize in on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift: the quiet discovery of the fragment pivots to the active, luminous display. The dominant stake (rediscovering joy) is tested and met through Elara's agency.

The cost of this sacrilege is felt on the page, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear from the outset: rescuing truth from lies. Escalation is driven by agency—the petal's fall creates urgency, the discovery of the letter deepens the conflict, and the plan to draw parallels is the decisive tactical choice that forecloses a path of direct confrontation. The cost of buried injustice is felt, though the modern parallels are summarized rather than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes concentrate on whether she stays detached or intervenes as decay intensifies; the increasing density of patterns functions as escalation under the chosen lens. The final decision forecloses a path (pure observation) with a felt price. There’s no sharp reversal, but the tightening is sufficient for this length. A slightly larger external pressure point could have heightened crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering legacy/purpose—tightens as dawn sharpens the frost and narrows her route to the crevice. The escalation is modest but coherent under the hybrid lens, driven by her attention and retracing choice. The visible price is light; the piece leans on internal reweighting rather than a hard trade-off. Still, the discovery credibly resolves the pressure without coincidence doing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (restore sound), and escalation tracks via intensifying heat maps and resonant response. However, obstacles are minimal and success feels relatively unresisted, limiting perceived cost. The tightening beat occurs when the fork interacts with the map and the conservatory answers, but it lacks a hard trade‑off. Momentum is steady rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are simple and strong—quiet the distress, earn lasting rest—with a marked tightening when the anguished spirit resists and Elias must occupy even tighter voids. Pressure coheres and escalates primarily through endurance, with visible costs (fatigue, risk of getting lost in memory whirlpools). The conflict resolves a touch smoothly; a deeper trade‑off or permanent loss would heighten the peak. Still, the cadence shift toward calm reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—unifying generations under sanctions—is clear, and the reveal meaningfully tightens tactics. Yet opposition remains off‑stage; the murmured youth unrest never confronts Elias. The price of exposure is stated but not tested, muting escalation despite a strong turn at the bell.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming stored love) is clear and pressure accumulates via breath modulation and vision intensification. The meaningful tightening arrives when forgiveness-guarded chambers are revealed, forcing a release decision. Opposition is largely internal and relatively unresistant, making the victory feel a touch easy. Still, the escalation coheres under the accumulative lens and resolves through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (escape the retrocognitive trap without losing the self’s aim) is legible early and tightens as visions intensify and the fragment heats. The key turn is agency‑driven: he applies hyperbolic geometry to force a rupture. The cost (sacrifice of the fragment and relinquished access to the past) lands on the page. Stakes could sharpen further with one more concrete external constraint beyond the fragment’s escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure coheres and tightens as invaders breach at the activation moment. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn, and the defensive victory forecloses a path for the looters. Cost is present but modest (continued captivity and risk), keeping escalation grounded rather than searing. No major reversal beyond the timed activation, but the single tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: transform absence into a sound. The escalation is a density increase: absences accumulate, the forge hums, crackle to crystallized snap; he then tests it in-ear, paying emotional cost. No antagonist, but the internal trial tightens credibly under the chosen lens. A single charged deepening (when the sound first “crackles”) effectively narrows options to completion or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—steal for destiny’s whisper or seek another path—is clear and tightens when the portrait reveals the station itself. The key deepening is the reinterpretation beat, which narrows options and pushes a renunciation. Internal and external threads interweave, but external jeopardy is minimal, softening felt price. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finish making spheres and choose whether to stay entombed in grief—tightens as water laps at the door, prompting faster, riskier work and a decisive exit. The bookmark embed is a meaningful trade‑off, turning memory into artifact with a cost. Escalation is single‑step and clean rather than knotted; no strong reversal, but sufficient deepening. Pressure is coherent and grows appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: outwit Mara to reclaim heritage and agency. Escalation tightens via Mara’s arrival, his climb despite vertigo, and the squeeze into the gap; each choice forecloses safer paths. The cost—moving through panic rather than erasing it—reads on the page. Resolution arises from his choices, not luck, even if the seashell mechanism is conveniently potent.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—complete the map before light vanishes—is clear and tightens as the final star wanes. Escalation is subtle but present (from pebbles and waves to “ultimate silence”). The visible price is time and loss of light; the decision to close the booklet under that pressure is earned. Still, conflict remains primarily tonal/ritual rather than oppositional, which limits torque.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (origin of thought) is signaled early and deepens as the music folds timelines into the present. Pressure escalates via density rather than opposition; the cadence shift when the courtyard “holds its breath” and the thaw arrives feels like the single meaningful tightening. The price is primarily a renunciation of mystery into a settled conceptual stance. Lack of a sharper trade‑off or constraint keeps tension low-medium.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is internal trust vs isolation; escalation tightens when Elias moves from covert eavesdropping to public projection, foreclosing safety. Pressure coheres under the silent‑world constraint and the ambiguous visions that demand interpretation. The cost—risking honesty—is clear but the counterforce (the visitor’s possible rejection) never bites, so peak tension is moderate. Still, the turn is earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear—prove the garden’s loyalty—and pressure coheres through Thorne’s public takeover and the frost clock. The tightening is credible: public surrender → secret work → amulet wobble → frost → reveal. Still, Elias pays little visible price under pressure; consequences land more on Thorne and the village’s worldview. The conflict escalates but lacks a sharp on‑page sacrifice or near‑loss.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is legible early: prove the theory without losing themselves to the nexus. Escalation tightens once meaningfully when the eddy threatens to pull them sideways; options narrow to reversal or risk. Cost is moderate but present—proof comes with a near-loss and forced shutdown. Agency drives both turn points (lever pull and reversal), with no coincidence solves.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused on deciphering the ghost’s code; escalation arrives when Elias chooses discord, risking sacrilege and damage to fragile artifacts. The sound-driven shift tightens pressure as the program’s images morph under stress. Cost is more atmospheric than concrete, but the choice narrows paths and redefines the tactic. The crescendo/hush structure provides a clear tightening and release.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular: can she reckon with the truth’s weight. Escalation tightens when Thorne reframes her tactic (“occupying margins”) and when she chooses to smudge, which irrevocably reveals the hidden scale. The cost—accepting culpable silence and lost years—lands. Pressure is quiet but coherent; no false peaks or hand-waving.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres from eerie quiet to apparition to the choice to act; the tightening is clear though not harrowing. The dominant stake is internal—the cost of repricing his father—and the ghost shift deepens that conflict. Stakes skew reflective over perilous, which slightly softens escalation. Still, the turn at the valve forecloses his prior narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (enduring neutrality versus the pull to observe more deeply) is present, but pressure remains gentle. The main tightening is the decision to leave after renewal and later to return; the civilization’s echo of swan‑folding adds conceptual pressure but little cost. Escalation is more cadence than consequence; options don’t narrow with visible price. Satisfying as ritual, less so as conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can Elara spark Finn’s wonder—tightens around the time-bound eclipse and her decision to expose her loss. The turn arrives when she opens the locket during totality, narrowing options from general therapy to an intimate, risky gesture. The price is vulnerability and the possibility of mishandling Finn’s grief; the payoff is his emotional break. Escalation is quiet but coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes (coaxing back a trace of dreaming) are clear but mostly conceptual; escalation is a knowledge deepening rather than pressure that forecloses options. The key tightening is the discovery of the diaries and then the tapestry, which raises potential rather than cost. No antagonist or time pressure, and Elias faces little resistance. Effective for a quiet piece, but the felt price is light.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are legible—exposing “open secrets” and risking social equilibrium—but pressure is low: Elias meets no resistance and faces no near-term consequences. The meaningful tightening (from teahouse closure to clandestine deliveries) occurs, yet conflict resolves off-page. The lack of a visible price at the peak limits tension. Internal and external strands align but don’t strain.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates via density and cadence shifts (loop layers → pause → crescendo). The time pressure (possession completion) coheres with his adaptive tactic (weaponized silence) and one meaningful tightening is present. The price is mostly conceptual/endurance rather than a vivid loss, tempering peak intensity. Nonetheless, agency resolves the conflict without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—transforming the temporal ache before exhaustion—tightens via the live clock of night→dawn and his weakening body. The meaningful turn occurs with the dawn’s arrival and the shell’s resonance. Pressure grows coherently though softly; no antagonist is needed, but the escalation stays internal and time‑bound. The visible price is stamina spent under the cold, with options narrowing to “now or not at all.”

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible and tightened by the clock and by each darker branch revealing new costs. The integration of all branches under strain is a meaningful escalation that forecloses prior options. The final choice trades immortality and flight for freedom, a clear price. Pressure grows coherently without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stake is focused (defeat numbness), and there is a clear deepening when Mira’s grief cracks and Elias layers another track. Pressure grows by density, not opposition; the cost is vulnerability rather than a foreclosed option. The escalation is persuasive but gentler than peak—no single turn forces a hard trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: whether to engage the invitation or preserve solitary integrity. The arrival and decoding shift (coordinates, folklore, ley lines) provide one meaningful tightening; the final refusal forecloses a path. Cost is present but understated; no strong outward consequence manifests. Internal and external pressures are woven, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (will he confront the vial and the grief it unlocks) is signaled early and tightens as the orchid completes and the UV script reframes the risk. The decisive act—uncorking—extracts a visible price (collapse into sobs) and forecloses avoidance. Pressure remains coherent; inward fear vs need drives the beat. While quiet, the escalation is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (eternal now vs human time) is signaled early and sharpened when a being appears with a bargain. Escalation arrives as a single tightening: the on‑page offer that forces a stance. The refusal is agency‑driven and reweights the cost, though consequences remain mostly conceptual. A slightly clearer felt price in the moment would deepen the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped resonance without shattering the hush—is legible. Escalation reads as a purposeful cadence shift when the vow triggers unbinding; the price is a renunciation of completion. Pressure is coherent but low-threat; no genuine alternative path is tested on-page. The earned resolution still feels grounded in agency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute half truths into wholeness—tightens as static shifts from jagged to river‑smooth. Agency is continuous, and the ritual choice forecloses her prior trade. However, external or internal counterpressure is light; no genuine complication tests her commitment beyond attentiveness and endurance. The felt price is present but restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is soft: the ethics of meddling and the risk of awkwardness are named but not tested hard. The locket reveal deepens stakes by tying to legacy, prompting the funding promise, but options never narrow with visible cost. No antagonist or reversal beyond that single deepening. The resolution feels earned yet low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (belonging) is clear and tight; the hesitation→search→assembly progression offers one meaningful deepening. Escalation is more communal ritual than pressure, with limited concrete jeopardy or trade‑offs on the page. The turn at the rim when the tag completes narrows options thematically but without a palpable sacrifice. Tension exists but stays gentle and luminous rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prolong the giant’s slumber—tightens through the vortex discovery and the temporal cage problem, culminating in the key-forging decision. Agency drives the turn (choosing to borrow time and uncage the bird). The price is implied more than felt, slightly softening the squeeze at the peak. Still, the escalation reads clean and purposeful under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (truth/closure vs. ambiguity) is signaled early and tightened through the ritual’s intensification to the vision. Escalation is internal but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost is felt (accepting possibility without proof), though external pressure and tangible jeopardy are minimal. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal—whether Elias will break cover for someone in need—and the pressure coheres around rediscovering the cached tape. Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening as the sense-memory pushes him from hidden guardian to visible guide. The cost and risk are soft; no significant external counterpressure tests him beyond the moment’s vulnerability. Nonetheless, the deepening is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—autonomy vs adaptive surrender—is signaled early through her research focus and tightened by the bodily takeover. The meaningful turn is her decision to stop struggling, which forecloses the path of simple refusal. The price is clear and ongoing: she accepts a sustaining transformation that redefines her life and work. Pressure remains coherent and grows with the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection/meaning) is signaled early and tightens when Mira claims the brooch. The decision to trade heirloom for story functions as an earned renunciation with an evident price. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens. Slight softness in overt opposition keeps it just shy of higher pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is to harness the cave’s power; the meaningful tightening occurs when she lifts the pearl and the forces begin inhabiting her. The pressure deepens as her clairvoyance destabilizes, forcing a stance shift from prediction to improvisation. Cost is clear though the conflict is largely internal and acceptance arrives with limited struggle. Still, the final charged poise (urged to be patient, conduit role) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (re-knit communal will) is clear, and pressure coheres via the staggered, interval-based revelations that steadily shift the crowd. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversal, fitting the chosen lens. The tightening is credible but gentle; no single beat forces a painful trade-off. Prices paid remain largely offstage or ambient.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and pressure coheres: he must risk confession to proceed. Escalation beats exist (follow arrows, leap rail, create ticket, punch it), but opposition is soft and largely procedural. The confession is a meaningful tightening but lands without sustained resistance. Resolution is earned by agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finding clarity and honoring Kai—is clear early and tightens as the tile reveals new pathways, forcing Elara to confront joy, terror, and guilt. Agency drives the turn: she chooses to transcribe deeper rather than retreat. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than external, but it’s legible. A slightly greater sense of risk or potential failure would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are signaled early (breach the after‑goodbye or remain cursed) and escalate coherently with the storm’s peak. The tightening turn occurs when the curse fights back, forcing her to spend the amulet (it shatters) to win a partial vision. Agency drives the pressure; she adapts from “forcing” to “coaxing” as tactics deepen. The price is unmistakable and alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (Elena’s asylum) and tightens via the midnight window and Alex’s ethical compromise. The “active waiting” deepens pressure credibly, and the breach is an earned turn. The cost is present (legal risk, moral compromise) though the on-page resistance during the hack is light. The internal and external conflicts interlock effectively at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving/awakening through collected textures) is established early; escalation arrives with the anomalous hum and the warning texture. Pressure coheres, but the price is conceptual rather than dramatized as a trade‑off or loss. The ending stance crystallizes intention more than it forecloses options, keeping tension modest. One tighter on‑page cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (rebuilding a self against erasure) is clear and coherently pressured by the environment and found relic. The meaningful tightening arrives with the poison label and the fisherwoman’s line, deepening the tapestry. Still, stakes escalate atmospherically more than via narrowing options, and the price paid remains largely internal. Tension works, but it never truly corners the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—solve the riddle before ephemera vanish—is established and tightened via the logbook’s closing and the compass fading. Escalation is modest but coherent: resonance intensifies, guidance sharpens, then dissolves, forcing acceptance at cost. Agency guides the turn; coincidence does not resolve. The price (loss of the compass and the foreclosed path to permanence) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (prevent privatization) is clear, and escalation tightens with corporate scouts and the envoy’s announcement. The mural plan is a meaningful deepening that redefines options (co-ops, buybacks). Still, prices and trade-offs are under-rendered on the page; the win gathers quickly once revealed. Tension is steady but rarely bites with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: capture the last grain at dawn to preserve a vanishing hush. Escalation tracks to the clock and chemical intervals, with one meaningful tightening as false dawn nears and the final reaction irrevocably dissolves the object. The price paid (losing the last grain; physical/mental endurance) is felt. While there’s no hard reversal, the accumulative cadence intensifies appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (launch navigation before dawn) is clear and active. Pressure coheres and gently mounts, but there’s no mid-scene complication that truly narrows options or risks failure; the method works essentially as planned. The tightening comes from the ticking clock rather than a reversal. Resolution is earned yet low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular and coherent: confirm and pursue the singular convergence despite peril. Escalation is a steady tightening—data returns, nature “confirms,” he prepares to face human and environmental unknowns. The price is implied rather than paid, but the choice to leave the outpost forecloses safety. A sharper on‑page complication or tradeoff would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent (revive Eldridge before collapse), and escalation occurs via density: from solitary ritual to communal heartbeat to bells. The tightening is felt when others join and the tremors ease, but explicit costs or squeezed options remain gentle. Resolution stems from Thorne’s sustained agency, not coincidence. Pressure fits the accumulative lens but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stakes—mission versus survival—are legible and tighten with the oxygen clock. The meaningful tightening is her deliberate override of panic to execute the unsnarling, foreclosing immediate flight. The cost is felt but not transformative beyond that one turn; external pressure does not compound with fresh obstacles. Nonetheless, agency drives the outcome and consequence registers.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (achieve hush/redemption before discovery) is clear, with escalation via the reveal of ghosts and the choice to confess through the lattice. The deepening narrows options by recontextualizing his task: integrate their stories, not just his. The price paid feels mostly internal; external consequences remain at a distance. Tension rises, but the clock and danger are not exploited for a more acute trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible from the start (repay the debt/awaken life), and pressure builds via pattern: each cameo widens the awakening and deepens the cost. Agency skews toward guided cooperation rather than hard tradeoffs; still, the final act through the bead narrows options decisively and exacts a price. The toll on Elias’s body and the permanent farewell land. Slight passivity prevents a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate texturally via accumulating intersections: bridge over isolation, orchids in darkness, and the altar weave. The tightening is real but gentle; risk or pushback is minimal, and coincidence (others sleepwalking) functions as given condition rather than pressure. Agency is present in the sewing at overlaps, but on‑page cost is soft. The ending is earned as deepening rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore faith) is clear and the pressure coheres, but escalation is gentle. The tightening arrives through the finds and the twitching root, yet options never narrow to a painful trade‑off. Coincidence is avoided, and agency drives progress. The felt price remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (protective creation of pseudonyms before mailing) is present but pressure escalates minimally. The live clock (kiosk chime, opening depot, first visitors) provides a gentle tightening rather than a true test. The outcome feels foregone; no option is visibly foreclosed. Quiet tension works, but the felt price is slight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear—expose conspirators before the coup—and the escalation is a deepening of synchronization that narrows possibilities toward the high astronomer reveal. However, resistance and price are muted; Elara encounters no concrete obstacles beyond effort and secrecy. The tightening is present but remains low‑temperature. The ending earns resolution through agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (face and redeem the unspoken apology) is legible, and escalation builds via method intensification—single message to a flood. The visible costs are the cut and the emotional exposure; no external counterforce tests her beyond self‑confrontation. The final “promise” forecloses a path (continued cryptic avoidance) but the trade‑off remains largely conceptual. Solid tightening without a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming fear into shared meaning—tightens as Elena moves from noticing Amir to decoding and eliciting confession. The turn arrives with the hidden poem, which reweights their anxieties. Costs are quiet (exposure, giving the coral) rather than structurally foreclosing a path, keeping the pressure gentle. Still, agency drives the resolution rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering joy—is signaled and pursued, with one meaningful deepening when the knowledge network awakens and options open. Escalation remains gentle; no true obstacle tests resolve or forces a trade‑off. The resolution is protagonist‑driven but with limited visible cost, moderating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) is signaled early and tightened through repeated awakenings that demand recommitment. Escalation is pattern‑based rather than adversarial; pressure coheres but remains gentle, with few options truly foreclosed beyond the conceptual trade. The decisive deepening arrives when she orchestrates a “grand reflection,” but the on‑page price is light. Resolution is earned by stance rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (evade thought tax to seed resistance) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as drones descend, forcing a single meaningful tightening: use the risky gourd now. The escalation is protagonist‑driven and culminates in a reweighted field of options. The visible cost is light—scattering and jeopardy without concrete loss—so the peak tests commitment but not to a punishing degree. Still, momentum and tension hold across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (end longing via the blossom armistice), and pressure coheres as the lullabies accumulate and animate the postcard. The meaningful tightening is the armistice taking hold and the essence being bound within the shell, foreclosing loneliness. While escalation is largely tonal and textural, the causal-deepening beats (method → postcard pulse → arrival) are clear. The cost is internal and ongoing rather than dramatized as a sharp trade-off at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the immediate threat of silence (the cracked tube) and the necessity to perform the rare method to avert loss. Escalation is modest but sufficient: discovery → careful extraction → risky use of the damaged tool to warp the note → lighting. The price—only temporary salvation and a deepened personal ache—is felt in the closing beats. A clearer on‑page risk of failure mid‑ritual could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are singular (mend trust before departure), and urgency is signaled by dawn. Escalation is limited; the ritual proceeds without resistance or reversal, and Thorne’s skepticism dissolves quickly upon exposure. The price is legible but light, with no significant trade-off during the peak beat. Pressure coheres but does not meaningfully tighten beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear, but escalation is gentle: discovery → decoding → implementation without a substantive squeeze or reversal. No antagonist or material obstacle appears on the page to force a trade‑off. The “breathing” clock adds texture, not pressure. The final act is earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (risking trust) is signaled early and tightens from ritual control to a vulnerable act. The meaningful turn is the decision to send a confession rather than another curated myth. Cost and consequence are on the page via the uncertain wait and the lived possibility of loss; the reply transforms options. Escalation could sharpen with one additional on‑page test pre‑release.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal and remain abstract; pressure deepens through pattern density rather than concrete obstacles. The main tightening arrives when storm codes align with wood knots, reweighting the threshold memory. Cost is articulated as acceptance rather than a trade‑off that forecloses options on the page. Tension is steady but low, with no sharp test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (belonging) is clear; escalation arrives as density and alignment peak rather than overt threat. The meaningful tightening is the guardians’ wary approach and the ritualized “shared exhale,” which narrows options to communion or failure. The visible cost is subtle (self-alteration/commitment), not a felt loss in-scene, keeping this below the top band. Still, agency drives the turn and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is present and pursued via a single deepening (from seed runes to a map). Escalation is primarily density/intensity rather than narrowing options; costs remain conceptual and gentle. The fading last seed adds a mild clock beat but doesn’t force a hard choice. Resolution is earned yet low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—creating a pocket of wonder before the next act—tightens under the live clock and wind, culminating in the crowd swell. The meaningful turn is the convergence of Mira, the flyers, and the music, but the price paid is modest and options aren’t sharply foreclosed. Agency is evident (planting the bishop, timing, tipping the musician), yet escalation feels smooth rather than testing. The lights ending is a clear cadence shift rather than a painful trade.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (transcendence vs. enforced forgetting) is clear, and pressure tightens when the “gaps” pull her essence and the garden roots her. The anchoring forecloses bodily freedom and forces an acceptance that reweights her goal. The cost is legible and persists into the ending. Escalation is driven by her actions (dance, inscription) rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding clarity before change—remains coherent and deepens via the ritual, with the mist‑enveloped atrium and expanding ripples tightening the cadence. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through hard turns, culminating in a resolved stance to proceed with work. The felt price (enduring progress’s cost) is present but understated, with no option truly foreclosed on the page beyond internal resistance. The quiet arc reads earned, if soft.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal: can Eli translate pain into connection without slipping into platitude or retreat. The meaningful tightening arrives when he opens the box and commits to telling; Mia’s tears confirm the bridge but introduce minimal counter‑pressure. The visible price is exposure of trauma and a relinquishing of solitary ownership of the ashes. Escalation is steady rather than tensile.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (revitalizing hope across timelines) is clear, and pressure increases via low readings and successive probes. Yet obstacles are soft and the path to success remains relatively unopposed; each pattern adjustment works without real setback or priced trade-off. The one meaningful tightening is a cadence deepening rather than a forced choice. Cost remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres: deeper entry → narrowed corridor → discovery → interpretive reveal; the diaries and negative intensify the quest’s stakes. The tightening is meaningful but low in overt price—no option is foreclosed beyond internal reweighting. Agency drives the key turn (choosing to continue, to piece the remnants). The final vow reframes rather than resolves, with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (convince unyielding mirrors) is explicit and the pressure coheres under the lyric lens. Escalation manifests as density: song → echo amplification → mirror rippling → alternate scenes revealed, with the bell as clock. The price is felt but the mirrors offer little pushback; the attempt never risks palpable failure on the page. Still, the implied forfeiture of the heartbeat gives the ending teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible and contained: end the forever war by binding a treaty at personal cost. Pressure coheres and tightens up to the muster and sacrifice, but opposition is soft—spirits assent without resistance, trimming tension. The visible price at climax clarifies consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs with the siphoning, but no strong reversal tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redemption versus self‑interest—is legible early and tightens through the valve decision and egg release. Agency drives the turns, and the cost is explicit. Escalation is smooth rather than pressured by obstacles, so the choice faces little resistance beyond conscience. Still, the decisive act convincingly forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: awaken the realm by harvesting echoes despite surveillance and taboo. Pressure coheres and tightens as echoes stir and alarm thickens, culminating in the last‑thread release. The on‑page price is more prospective than paid, but the risk is unmistakable. Escalation is agency‑driven and not repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (ethics vs. manipulation) is established and tightens through reflective pressure into a concrete commitment. The argument’s aftermath coherently escalates to a plan that forecloses prior paths. The price is present but mostly inferred rather than dramatized under friction. Tension is steady rather than spiky, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to honor the vanished—tightens at the knotting apex and is stress-tested by the monarch’s landing. The reversal (from orchestrating to witnessing) forecloses a path, with a felt price: surrender of authorial harmony. Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres through a ritual task that must be executed precisely. Escalation reads as a steady tightening from preparation to activation, culminating in illumination and voices. Cost is primarily emotional rather than a hard trade‑off; still, the risk of silence and the tremor in her hands lend tension. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are unified (find why paths choose their walkers) and pressure coheres through storm escalation and the decayed directive. The meaningful tightening is her decision to sleep and interpret under duress, leading to changed knowledge. However, tangible cost and foreclosed options are soft; no hard trade‑off is dramatized at the peak. Tension functions more as atmosphere than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (sealing the covenant) is clear, and the portal’s appearance is a real tightening. However, opposition is minimal; risk (heresy, failure) is gestured at rather than tested. The price—binding vigilance—is felt but soft on the page. Escalation reads as steady intensification rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (release of resentment) is signaled early and tightened via the pin’s activation and the embodied tracing of patterns. Pressure escalates from guarded observation to guided ritual to convulsive release. The cost is felt but light; the resolution arrives without a difficult trade‑off or persistent price. Still, the internal and external pressures interweave coherently at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and present throughout, and escalation tracks via deepening breath and mirror activation. Yet pressure remains largely unopposed—no reversal or visible loss—so the narrowing of options feels gentle rather than sharp. The choice is endurance/attention under ritual, but the price paid isn’t strongly felt. Satisfying, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent: physical danger and the risk of failing the generational handoff. Escalation tightens when he dangles and must improvise with spilled tools; the poem deepens the internal conflict rather than resolving it cheaply. The price is felt (risk and the relinquishment of a fixed reading of vows), though the external peril resolves quickly. The final stance is earned by his agency rather than coincidence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—knowledge vs self-erasure/solitude—is signaled early and tightens when the mirrors crack. The etching revelation deepens stakes, and the warning forces a stance rather than offering an easy out. The cost is primarily conceptual but felt in the final calm under threat. A single, meaningful escalation suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—securing permission and access to prevent future collapse—is clear early. The key tightening is the vow toll, which forces a strategic, non‑brute‑force solution; the lily loophole turn narrows options. Subsequent trials (illusionary shelves) feel relatively frictionless, limiting a sense of rising cost. Resolution remains earned but a touch easy for the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (find the garden by reuniting selves) is signaled early and deepened via the storytelling ritual. The meaningful tightening arrives as the twin’s presence threads into her voice, culminating in the fog’s parting. Escalation is steady rather than sharp; conflict stays mostly internal and low‑friction. The price paid feels gentle, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is to resolve the absences before the door vanishes; it’s signaled early and tightened by the spectral cacophony and teetering anomaly. Escalation is present but gentle; no reversal tests her commitment. Resolution is protagonist-driven, but the price is light, keeping the pressure modest. A visible trade-off or partial loss would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure coheres around subduing the beings’ cacophony; escalation tracks through the ritual’s stages until the storm meets the hush. The opposition is impersonal and mostly static, so the tightening relies on cadence and density rather than reversals. The price paid is stamina/focus, not a visible sacrifice that narrows future options. Still, the ritual choice credibly earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through concrete steps from discovery to repair. The tightening is coherent—searching at night with wind and brambles introduces mild jeopardy and a visible price (blood, effort). Agency drives the turns, not coincidence, though the success comes swiftly once the method appears. Costs remain modest, preventing a higher pressure score.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake (preserve/reshape identity before memory erodes), with a tangible tightening as the storm intensifies and whispers fade. Escalation is mostly density and urgency rather than a sharp reversal; still, the anomalies force re‑conjecture and a shift from measurement to inscription. Cost is primarily conceptual (accepting isolation’s price; revealing a buried betrayal) rather than immediate loss on the page. The resolution arises from her agency, though the trade‑off could be sharpened further.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (rekindling creative purpose in the oppressive hush) is clear and escalates through discovery and a risky act. The meaningful tightening is the decision to ignite and spin fire, which deepens the mosaic’s message and reweights options. Cost is present but modest (physical risk and emotional exposure). Pressure remains coherent though largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can they navigate the letting-go?—is signaled early and tightens through the held silence and the charged placement/return of the cicada. The escalation is textural rather than reversal-based but culminates in a narrow, meaningful act (the handoff) that reweights options. The price is primarily emotional and anticipatory, not sharply dramatized. Still, the cadence shift at Elara’s question effectively peaks the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (gather silences to alter her fear) is set early and escalates via the ticking hour and the deeper foray to the core hush. Choices tighten options (leaving through a vent, shielding the doll, moving to the nexus) and the time pressure credibly narrows tactics. Costs are felt but not crushing; the piece favors lyric intensity over punishing consequences. The protagonist’s agency, not coincidence, drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can comfort Mira—tightens as Elias escalates from rhythm control to strategic pauses to the catalytic use of the vial and a personal confession. The ghosted train whistle provides a timely pattern break that deepens pressure. Costs are modest and internal, but present. The resolution arises credibly from Elias’s deliberate tactics rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (reach stairway before sunrise, claim throne) is clear and escalates through the peeling puzzle and dawn pressure. The key tightening is the socket reveal that transforms knowledge into immediate action. However, visible cost remains modest; the ascent and claim proceed without a setback or trade‑off that alters tactics. Tension is steady rather than spiking.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protecting a boundary while honoring compassion—tightens as the encroachment accelerates the threshold’s fade. Elara’s agency drives the turn (summoning, choosing to link through scars, guiding release), with a visible price paid (sealing the portal, renewed solitude). The escalation is coherent under the situational lens. Slightly higher stakes-in-risk on failure could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: retrieve the bolt to catalyze transformation. Escalation is mostly atmospheric (mounting pressure, probabilistic coordinates) rather than obstacle-driven; there’s one tightening at the wreck but no real reversal. The cost reads as endured pressure but doesn’t force a trade-off. Resolution is protagonist-driven yet comparatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth to end a legacy—is present early, and pressure coheres as the device brings the confession. The escalation is more deepening than narrowing; the cost is largely internal and prefigured, limiting visceral tension. Still, the decision to never turn the crank again and to leave the manor functions as a credible tightening. The conflict remains quiet but purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (harness the shifting reality to reshape his life) is signaled early and culminates in the ritual. Escalation occurs via density and cadence rather than opposition; tension rises as “reality shifts,” but concrete resistance is minimal. The gauntlet unsnapping provides a credible narrowing of options. The price is present but not deeply tested by counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she reframe pain through a discovered kindness—tightens as she follows the densest dust pattern to the button. The escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a high-pressure turn, consistent with the chosen lens. The price paid is subtle (emotional exposure, choosing hope), so the stakes feel gentle. Still, the soldier’s story and the button’s message credibly catalyze her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (piercing enforced indifference) is signaled early and tightened by the safe‑house raid and the glitch at the climax. The meaningful turn is Elara’s improvisation using the lagoon’s reflective surface to salvage the broadcast, trading stealth for impact. Cost is legible (lost data, captured allies, heightened exposure) and options narrow believably. No antagonist on page, but pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is explicit from the outset and escalates as the prophecy manifests and “fights back.” The key tightening is the voiced “enough” that fortifies the accumulating hush, followed by the longest silence. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, though the price paid is primarily internal and not deeply costly. The resolution is earned by endurance and intent rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled (decode prophecies for renewal) and the escalation tracks through the ritual to the spirit’s emergence. Pressure tightens gently via density and spectacle rather than through hard trade-offs or narrowed options. There’s no resistance, setback, or visible price for success. The resolution feels earned but consequence-light.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—crossing the ledge and embracing uncertainty—tightens at the waterfall where a misstep equals failure. The key turn is agency-driven: he abandons planning to improvise with pendulum and leaves. Prices are mostly conceptual and risk-based; stakes could land harder with a concrete sacrifice. Still, tension coheres and builds to the chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is clear (redeem Aurora/rename meaning), and pressure deepens when he invokes the full zodiac and the foundry trembles. Escalation is more tonal than jeopardy-driven, with few narrowing options or trade-offs. The success feels earned but lightly contested. The cost is primarily internal and retrospective.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—liberate Thorne’s soul—tightens when Elara pivots her tactic, infusing laughter into the ritual. Pressure remains coherent but remains gentle; Thorne’s resistance softens quickly, limiting the felt cost. The harp shift is a credible deepening under the causal lens. Resolution is earned by her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—computing mercy through relived trauma—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying waves toward a decisive reweighting. The cost (re‑experiencing the breaking and accepting guilt) is legible and informs the outcome. Agency manifests as endurance and consent to the method, culminating in a stance change. The tightening is clear when the converging beams force the final reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset, and pressure coheres via the three-painting sequence—each pass reveals more and tightens focus. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than a sharp reversal; the final “unfastening” reads earned. The price paid is underarticulated—no clear foreclosed option besides the end of burden—so tension never quite bites. Agency drives the climax, but stakes remain largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped performers by uncovering what the ceiling hides—is signaled and tightens via the discovery and use of the barrel. Escalation remains coherent under a causal lens but resolves quickly with minimal complication or sacrifice. The reversal (winding counterclockwise) is neat and protagonist-driven. Lacking a felt price or foreclosed option keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight: risk the library’s perfection to compress eternity. Escalation is a purposeful sequence culminating in the rupture; the price is not theoretical as the system fractures on the page. A meaningful tightening occurs at discovery of the “potent pattern” and the choice to release the whisper. The cost is visible and ongoing, not neatly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (untainted evidence to reweight a civilization’s story) is clear and tightens once when the storm forces a tactical pivot. The devised method creates a meaningful turn that changes options and yields knowledge. The price paid remains mostly procedural and emotional, not a sharp sacrifice; no strong loss or foreclosed alternative beyond time exposure. Tension is steady if not blistering.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake; escalation arrives when midnight’s lies cause the ferns to wilt and Elias must recommit with a binding melody. The tightening is clear, but the price paid is light—no path is foreclosed beyond the demand for honesty. Agency drives the turn (singing louder, anchoring the web), and coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. Tension operates, though without a sharp tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—seeking the inexplicable—is signaled early and deepens at the lagoon, but pressure remains low with little resistance or trade-off. The meaningful tightening occurs when she enters and swims toward the glow, yet no option is foreclosed with a tangible cost. The compass/visions progressively narrow path, but without genuine threat. The ending is earned but not hard-bought.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake centers on whether and how she will respond to the slide by making—less survival than artistic stance. The key tightening is the discovery/activation of the slide prompting on‑site sculpting; beyond that, pressure does not escalate, and the price remains minimal. Future‑leaning stakes (rising seas, alliances yet to be forged) broaden conceptually but don’t squeeze her choices now. Effective but relatively low‑heat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure deepens once through the discovery/decoding mechanism culminating in the dawn alignment and final message. The stake remains personal understanding and lineage reckoning; escalation is gentle but coherent for the chosen lens. The cost is primarily emotional (confronting grief, redefining her drive), not materially constraining. Agency drives the turns, though the conflict never truly tightens into a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (extract the truth) is clear, with one meaningful tightening: speech fails, forcing the debris‑code gambit and ultimately a moral trade (“FORGIVE TO FREE”). Pressure coheres and rises through wind interference, spectral hesitation, and the dunes’ burial threat. The reversal (ghost replies in kind) deepens rather than resolves, leading to the decisive bargain. Costs—psychic scorch and risk of erasure—are felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—authentic revival vs. wish‑mirage—is clear, and the meaningful turn is the refusal plus the lantern‑lighting. Pressure escalates modestly; much of the “work” is summarized rather than tested by obstacles. The cost is legible but not sharply priced on the page. One concrete setback would have tightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (capture the city’s unease) is signaled early; escalation proceeds via a deepening of method (immersion → Hittite/Aramaic incantation) and an unintended consequence (prophecy). The meaningful tightening is the accidental prophecy that converts archival intent into transformative risk, with a small immediate cost (tremor, apples falling) and larger consequences unfolding. Pressure is coherent but largely internal and atmospheric, with limited on‑page trade‑off or foreclosed option. Still, the turn reweights the stakes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is visible early and escalates from signal (hatching) to commitment (entry). Pressure coheres, but resistance is minimal; success flows without a reversal or a trade‑off beyond implied risk. The tightening exists (stars aligning, vortex stabilizing), yet a felt price or foreclosed option is lightly rendered. Agency drives the resolution credibly, if comfortably.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (warn villages or risk silence) is clear and tightens at zero hour with a credible temptation to pull. The escalation is modest but coherent; the meaningful turn is the switch to silent observation and the later refusal. Cost is primarily internal (doubt), with external stakes defused when the storm veers; this mutes bite at the peak. Still, the renunciation is tested and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on Elara’s stance toward vulnerability, tightened by the extraordinary star’s descent and her deliberate pause before the cleaning cue. The deepening is credible, but the visible price is mostly internal and lightly sketched. No true reversal occurs; escalation is a measured density increase consistent with the chosen lens. The closure forecloses “mere hiding,” though the cost could be more felt.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular and legible: whether and how to honor unspoken words. Pressure deepens when Mira’s ghost appears and the inscription is revealed, nudging a choice between prying and reverent preservation; he pays the price of renunciation. The escalation is quiet but definite, appropriate for the mode. A narrower, sharper on-page dilemma could have heightened cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (understanding before time runs out) and tightens when time freezes and she must act through the coded ritual. The key deepening is her decision to embed her own message and speak the “exchange” out loud. The price is soft on the page—no palpable loss beyond urgency—so escalation feels elegant rather than harrowing. Still, the cadence shift from erratic flow to suspended to enriched time reads as a meaningful tightening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused (restore the drake/dawn weave) and pressure tightens from discovery to tending to release. Escalation is subtle but legible, culminating in the “kite string snaps” gust and attempted flight. Cost registers as enduring incompleteness; there’s little jeopardy or foreclosed alternative path beyond acceptance of scars. Earned, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (forge communion before death) is present and tightens as the remodel advances to activation. The escalation is a density increase rather than a hard reversal; the visible price is stamina and dwindling time. One meaningful deepening arrives with the pillars’ hum and carvings awakening. Still, pressure never forces a painful trade beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (reclaim belonging, resist assimilation) and the tightening arrives as unexpected convergence via footprints and the group at the tower. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; the cost is mostly conceptual (yielding some skepticism), with minimal on‑page jeopardy or trade‑off. The archivist’s reveal reweights options but doesn’t force a hard choice. Tension is steady, quiet, and coherent for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear—revive a killed reef—and pressure escalates through intensifying bird calls and successive, targeted releases. However, opposition is soft; no beat forces a trade‑off beyond resource expenditure, and success arrives without a credible threat of failure. The single tightening (targeting the deepest blood seep at the eastern edge) helps but doesn’t markedly raise cost. Resolution is earned by agency but remains low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (bridging distance to brother), and pressure tightens with the riddle’s solution and the warning about “tinted” truths. Escalation is primarily informational; external pressure remains low, with minimal tangible loss or trade-off on page. The ending commits to action, but the felt cost is soft. One concrete foreclosed option or sacrifice would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are primarily internal—finding a “true north” in isolation—signaled early and tightened by the glimpse that transforms watching into pursuit. The key deepening arrives when she aligns the applique and commits to the logs. Costs are understated; no concrete loss or narrowed option is paid on the page beyond accepting outcast identity as fuel. Tension is steady rather than ratcheting, appropriate to the lens but limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (“amend the sky”) is signaled early and pressure coheres through infiltration and the timed swaps. The meaningful tightening arrives when the last pawn clicks and the Archmage wakes, but the price curve is shallow—the pieces’ automatic “thaw” solution undercuts the need for a costly choice in the clash. Still, escalation is mostly protagonist‑driven and resolves from his prior tactic. A single, clear turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: unbind the penumbra to liberate small gestures and claim the historian role. Pressure coheres as the entity forms and resists when Alex intensifies the ritual, a single meaningful tightening. Yet the price for success reads minimal—no significant loss, damage, or irreversible trade‑off beyond exertion—so the turn lacks sharper cost contours. The conflict resolves cleanly once the cadence shifts, limiting aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus anesthetic substitution—tightens through the ritual into a decisive renunciation. The on‑page price (raw visions; shattering the orb) clarifies a foreclosed path. Escalation feels protagonist‑driven rather than coincidental; the legends and rite guide but do not solve the choice. A second, sharper test under pressure could raise the sense of risk further.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness/break the hush) is clear and tightens as he decodes and admits fault. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the causal lens; the thunder lull and unraveling threads mark a meaningful deepening. The price is largely internal, and the path feels smooth—no setback or counter-pressure—but still earned. The soft crack as first sound is a solid externalization of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres: the looming dawn and intensified refractions force a stance shift from playful defiance to burdened readiness. The thickening mist/visions serve as the meaningful deepening. Cost is stated and felt, though largely internal and quiet. A single sharper on‑page test of her resolve would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—survive/save the workshop by completing the ritual—is legible and tightens as the sea rises and breath dwindles. Escalation tracks through successive pockmarks, each narratively heightening pressure and narrowing options. The final alignment reads as an earned culmination rather than coincidence. Some costs remain largely physical/ritual; a sharper sacrifice might have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (release the past/honor the promise) is signaled early and meaningfully tightens with the wrong turn leading to the grotto. The oasis functions as a deepening, not a convenient fix, and the price—abandoning the comfort of nostalgia—is felt. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent, with one decisive intensification at the shell’s activation. A touch more on-page resistance or risk would have heightened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (reach Mira/prove method), but pressure never truly tightens—no counterforce tests his belief once the ritual begins. The sole turn is initiation of the beckoning; success follows without complication or visible price. Coincidence isn’t used; it’s just low‑resistance causality. The reunion is touching but under‑earned in escalation terms.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—building a device to guide loss home—tightens via the moon’s constraint and the progressive clarity of calls. Escalation is a steady accumulation rather than sharp turns; the full‑moon activation is the single meaningful deepening. The price (re‑opening grief to become a public beacon) is present but understated. A bolder foreclosed option or on‑page tradeoff would lift pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (mental shielding) is signaled early, and the storm intensifies pressure, pushing her from plan to execution. The meaningful tightening is the initiation of the ritual in active peril and the moment the eye “pierces” her thoughts. Cost and consequence remain more conceptual than visceral—no hard trade-off beyond secrecy and risk—keeping escalation solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (will he take on the stranger’s burden) is set early and tightens through the visions and the realization of deliberate erasures. Escalation is primarily internal, but the methodical lighting of candles and focus on “gaps” show tactics sharpening. The final pinning forecloses his prior retreat into isolation, though a sharper price signal (risk, danger, or sacrifice) would elevate pressure. Still, the deepening is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: time pressure and narrowing physical avenues force adaptation (abandoning the map to follow ants). The pivotal tightening is the chip fitting the indentation, with the emotional turn occurring in the doorway. The price—relinquishing the clung‑to version of Clara—is felt but soft; physical jeopardy is present but never bites. Still, agency drives the turns rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs kingdom’s peril) is signaled early and pressure coheres: warning → physical ascent risk → ritual activation → seduction → reveal. The meaningful tightening occurs at the ritual, where options narrow and cost rises via temptation and potential soul‑damage. The cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally; no tangible sacrifice occurs on the page beyond risk. Still, agency drives the turn and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—risking friendship to seek romance—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to leave mid‑confession and craft the sun. Escalation is internal but legible; the portal interlude deepens rather than resets. The price (sacrificing the curl; risking rejection) is present but cushioned by the story’s certainty of acceptance. Tension operates more lyrically than combatively yet remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over time/self—tightens at the sight of freer past selves, spikes with the leap, and culminates at the grave. The decisive deepening is confronting the grave rather than fleeing it; the agency is clear. The price is primarily interior (renouncing envy, accepting death as chapter), which reads but doesn’t bite hard. No antagonist needed, but the escalation curve is more graceful than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes concentrate on meaning and inheritance crystallized through the repair and the revealed lineage of the screw. Pressure deepens when the screw’s origin is recognized and Mira’s subtext becomes speech, leading to a shared stance. The cost is emotional rather than tactical; it’s convincing but gentle, with no hard foreclosure. One solid tightening; no reversals beyond a micro‑turn.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (continue the ceremony by shedding crystals without self-harm) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when crystallization immobilizes her. The choice of gentle superstition over force narrows options and carries risk; the mantra-guided etching is a decisive adaptation. Stakes are personal yet viscerally felt; the resolution is earned by agency. If anything, the external consequence could be shaded a touch sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconnection to apologize—is explicit early and coherently stressed by the limited window before the cutting. Escalation comes via the apparition’s fragile hold and the external timer ticking to machinery rumble. The price is unmistakable: forgiveness only partial, contact collapsing. There’s no big reversal, but the narrowing options are felt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is clear, and escalation is framed by the hiccup’s intensifying pressure and the spiral’s inward curve. However, resistance is minimal; obstacles dissolve rather than force trade-offs, and there’s no palpable price or foreclosed path. The final act reads as invocation rather than a pressured decision. Stakes stay largely abstract instead of embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accrues as the water reverses, temperature drops, and he counts down to the precipice; the hairline fractures and halt at the “precipice” mark a meaningful deepening. The dominant stake (understanding what clocks measure) tightens once and pays off. Still, the on‑page price and foreclosed option are soft, keeping escalation strong but not punishing. Agency drives the turn via the key and method.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (contain breach/protect crop) is clear and the breach forces focused action. Escalation is modest: detection to sealing to design pivot with minimal friction, sacrifice, or time pressure. The internal and external threads interweave, but the problem resolves without a tangible price or foreclosed option beyond Elara’s interior shift. A sharper complication or trade‑off would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—how to engage uncertainty without ruin—is clear and coherently pressured by the graffiti quest. The meaningful tightening arrives when she lights the lantern and reads the reweighted message; it prompts her vow. Cost is mostly conceptual and not fully felt as a trade‑off on the page; opposition is gentle, with little friction beyond weather and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on Elias’s ethic versus his loneliness; pressure tightens when a caller recognizes him, violating his curated distance. His decision to “loop the call to himself” functions as the meaningful deepening, and severing connections earlier establishes his pattern. Still, prices paid remain mostly interior and implied; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond his self‑conception, so escalation feels elegantly quiet rather than bracing. The turn is earned but could register with a sharper cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: can he regenerate the covenant in the twilight window. Escalation tightens through the approaching end of light, the choice to steep the photo, and the rising wind/laughter. Cost is the acceptance of haunting; the trade‑off is clear though gentle. The pressure curve is steady rather than sharp, landing more in intensity of mood than hard foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ending isolation—tightens when Elias proposes reciprocity and puts the rock into play, narrowing options from spectating to sharing. Pressure escalates through the rumor chain’s improbable amplification until laughter breaks his defensive persona. The price is vulnerability and a shift in identity (no longer elusive). Stakes remain intimate and clear without needing an explicit antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (navigate grief) is signaled early and tightens as the melody‑trail densifies and the ring points to the nexus. Escalation is primarily tonal and textural; there’s little resistance or loss, so cost registers more as inward labor than forfeit. The final stillpoint reweights options credibly under the chosen lens. A single, deeper complication would have sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (undo consequence of wrong seeds) is clear, and pressure tightens once when the signal invites action and the pen “awakens.” Escalation remains gentle—solutions largely succeed on first try; few options foreclosed and little price paid. The “unbending” moment works symbolically but risk feels contained. The resolution reads earned yet comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering voice vs. safe obscurity) is signaled early and tightens when Elias accepts the mapping method and risks sounding his hum. The turn from interior rehearsal to public melody narrows options and forecloses the refuge of silence. Price is mainly internal but felt; the passersby witnessing him raises exposure. Escalation is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the promise—tightens through the art‑trail deepening to the decisive act of portrayal. The key turn is the discovery behind the portrait and the choice to reconstruct, with an internal cost. Pressure is largely internal; absence of an external counterforce softens escalation. Still, the cadence shift to tears and redefinition reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and escalates via the intensified drumming and the garden’s response. The meaningful tightening arrives with the faint pulse, reweighting options and hope. Costs are implied (overstimulation, defiance, self‑doubt) but not concretely paid on the page. One more visible trade‑off or foreclosed path would deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early (“prove whispers beat shouts”) and tightened by the race structure. Escalation tracks as storm intensifies and Marcus’s approach backfires while Elias adapts. Visible price skews external and on Marcus’s side; Elias faces little jeopardy, tempering the felt stakes. Still, agency guides the deepening and earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will confess—tightens as the light patterns intensify and focus her attention. The guardian’s method deepens pressure rather than adding reversals; escalation reads as cadence shift culminating in the whispered admission. Cost is mostly internal and prospective; a concrete external repercussion isn’t shown, slightly limiting peak sting. Still, the turn is earned and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—spark a rebellion of doubt under an oppressive regime—are present and tighten via the hush’s peak and the synchronized displays. Escalation is felt as density rather than danger; the cost is primarily the orb’s depletion and the ethical risk taken by students. Antagonistic pressure is offstage, limiting visceral tension. The final activation is earned by Elias’s setup and patience.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (leave/stay; self vs. bond) and tightens decisively at the whale’s call. Marek’s soft-grab and “Go then” force the trade-off, making the price explicit. The escalation is single-step but clean, with internal and external pressures braided. A second complicating beat could have deepened the squeeze, but the core turn holds.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mourning under surveillance—remains coherent, and pressure tightens with Mira’s arrival and the illegal locket. The choice to “renew” the bouquet while narrating to camouflage grief is a meaningful tactic with conceptual cost. However, escalation stops short of a hard reversal; there’s no proximate enforcement knock or near-catch to force a trade-off beyond the chosen method. The cost is felt but largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—engage the colonnade without catastrophic boundary collapse—is established and tightened as the hum intensifies and the paraphrase deepens. Escalation is primarily textural; a single deepening choice (kneeling, touching, paraphrasing “deeper”) reweights the risk. Opposition never bites, so cost remains low and there’s no reversal. Resolution is earned by his method choice, but the felt price is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—gain color at the price of self—tightens coherently to a reversal. The awakening functions as the decisive intensification; the revoke narrows options and extracts a price. Agency drives both turns, and consequence persists. The threat level is intimate rather than life‑threatening, but the emotional cost reads unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—locating the “texture of connection”—tightens through a single decisive intensification as assumptions are challenged, increasing thrust and risk. The escalation remains coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the near-failure of the lens. Stakes are slightly abstract, softening the bite of pressure, yet the visible price (stress on equipment, trembling) grounds consequence. Resolution flows from her chosen method rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (renewal vs. withering) is clear, and pressure coheres: Lira hesitates, then commits to a painful, identity-altering act. The escalation is steady but gentle; conflict resolves without a substantive reversal or sacrifice beyond the procedure and departure. Stakes feel intimate and appropriately scaled, though a sharper test of resolve would heighten consequence. The end forecloses an option (remaining in stasis) and opens another with felt, if understated, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (can Marcus find a redemptive path) is clear, and the tape’s reveal tightens the frame by enabling actionable mapping. Pressure, though, remains low: the “branches” are discussed, not tested, and no option is visibly foreclosed in-scene. The turn is more informational than costly, with minimal on‑page consequence. Tension exists but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (purify nostalgia to unlock the pagoda) is established early and tightens as the dance intensifies and the pagoda’s response escalates. The persistent constraint (no patterns) narrows options credibly, and the cost (collapse, irreversible loss of innocence) is unmistakable. External antagonism is diffuse, but internal/external pressures interlock coherently. Resolution is protagonist-driven, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and held: protect hope’s form from the unbound shadow’s erosion. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens—from noticing to investigation to binding—tightened by the revelation that the shadow is her own remnant. The price is her acceptance of regret and transformation of it into guardianship. A single decisive tightening occurs; a second complication might have deepened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconstructing purpose without bitterness) is clear and tightened through the “shedding layers” tactic, especially the decision to temper empathy with self‑respect. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens: each removal (maps, permits, lies in the journal) increases commitment. Cost is internal and conceptual rather than situational; it reads, but the pressure never truly bites from the outside. A single stronger pinch or loss could have sharpened the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—achieving meaningful closure—tightens when “tunnel” reframes the task from external to internal action. Escalation arrives via activating the hourglass and suffering the visions, with visible cost in relived grief. Pressure remains coherent; the protagonist’s agency drives the decisive deepening. The trade‑off is more emotional than tactical, keeping the ceiling just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—intensifies through the deepening revelations of Harlan and the letters; the “incubation” sequence is the clearest escalation. The cost remains mostly conceptual; there’s little on‑page pressure testing her resolve beyond the internal turn. Still, the knowledge shift narrows options by making inaction untenable. The final choice to pursue beginnings rather than goodbyes is earned by the chain of discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (freeing creativity/rest) is signaled early and escalates through a meteor pattern intensification. The tightening arrives via the meteor shower “barrage,” prompting sustained, deliberate tracing. However, tangible price or foreclosed options remain light; there’s little risk or trade-off beyond endurance. The resolution is earned by persistence rather than a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reanimating possibilities in a dead world—is legible and tightens when the clock stirs and divergences spill into visible renewal. Pressure escalates via density and cadence rather than opposition; the choice to charm is the main lever. The price is endurance and responsibility, implied in “endless vigils,” though the moment lacks a hard trade‑off or immediate risk. Still, the cadence shift at the trembling clock reads as a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is internal (recovering the mind’s frontier) and escalates via a clear sequence: bass → shrill → melodic tinkling culminating in unraveling. Pressure tightens through pattern density rather than antagonism, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is mostly conceptual; no reversal tests his commitment beyond endurance and attention. Still, the last grove credibly deepens cost and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (will she commit to the arduous, indirect crossing to awaken courage) are signaled early and deepen once the ticket is punched and the hidden path demands trust. Escalation is gentle but real, culminating in the boat’s departure. Costs remain primarily conceptual, with little on‑page sacrifice beyond the fear‑scrap and acceptance of delay. Pressure coheres, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (price of safety vs. voice) tightens through the found bolt that reweights the past, producing a credible turn. Pressure is mostly internal, yet coherent and escalating via pattern density. The price is legible but low-external; no acute on-page risk slightly softens the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake (unmask the pretender) tightens as the rune’s influence accumulates toward the alignment. The decisive turn—Vesper triggering a ritual that the planted runes corrupt—reads earned and protagonist‑driven. The price paid is clearest for Vesper; Elowen’s cost registers more as ongoing burden than a sharp loss. Still, the pressure coheres and escalates under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are focused early (why paths disappear, with moral and scientific weight), and pressure coheres as the storm and solitude force an overnight push. Escalation arrives through intensified tapping, anomaly detection, and the Morse decoding—narrowing options toward a single interpretive leap. The price is conceptual/emotional more than practical, but it’s legible and reshapes her next move (from questioning to sharing). A small on‑page obstacle beyond weather could have sharpened the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—reigniting a stalled rebellion—is signaled early, and pressure accrues atmospherically toward the stone’s activation. Yet escalation lacks resistance; the humming artifact provides a frictionless path to success. The final act is decisive but bears no clear trade‑off or loss, so tension never tightens into cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent and signaled early (tradition vs intentional evolution), with one solid tightening at the dive/unseal. Escalation is mostly obstacle‑lite; decoding is summarized and the dive succeeds without significant reversal. The cost is implied (elder backlash, bodily risk) more than dramatized in resistance. Still, the decisive act stems from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (can he navigate a triggered episode without losing his rebuilt purpose?) is clear and tightens at the rumble-induced freeze. The reversal is small but decisive: from paralysis into deliberate, embodied focus. The price—reopened grief, bodily tremor—is felt and colors the outcome. No antagonist is needed; internal and external pressures interleave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preventing unraveling/existential survival) is signaled early and tightened by the walls literally closing in. The decisive action—untangling and reweaving threads—earns resolution without coincidence solving it. Cost is legible in the lingering ache and the acceptance of “necessary darkness.” Stakes scale coherently from personal blockage (failed portraits) to world fracture and back to transformed craft.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discover the why) is clear, and escalation occurs when he chooses to merge inks and step into the portal. Pressure stays coherent but gentle; the sabotage doesn’t materially obstruct his tactic and no meaningful option is foreclosed. The risk of vanishing reads more as mood than a concrete price. Resolution arises from his agency, but the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. enforced ignorance) is signaled early and tightens when the networks wake, forcing a commitment. The decisive act forecloses her safer path and risks trace/overload. Tension is coherent at beat and story scales, though the felt price is more projected than paid. No contrived antagonist; pressure remains internal/external and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (weaving continuity through chaos) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she decides to make and use the sheath rather than treat the scrap as debris. Pressure remains largely internal and situational; no antagonist and limited visible price keep escalation gentle. The final choice forecloses violent options symbolically and credibly. A slightly sharper external test would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: capture the goddess’s echo within a volatile window. Escalation manifests as pattern intensification rather than direct opposition; Eron adapts with silence and timing, then faces a quiet trade‑off in the release. Pressure coheres but remains gentle; risk and tangible loss are minimal. The tightening is meaningful, not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible early (control the narrative vs. scandal) and deepen as she chooses open confrontation. Escalation is primarily internal, moving from analysis to an irreversible invitation. The price is more conceptual than dramatized, with no tangible loss yet realized. Still, the decision forecloses the path of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (redemption through connection) is signaled early and tightens through activation, tethering, and self‑tattoo. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, though opposition is soft and solutions arrive without significant setback. The return to the storm is a meaningful deepening that changes options. Emotional and bodily prices are present but not punishing, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates texturally: ambient dissonance concentrates into a charged stillness via Elara’s agency. The key tightening is her “Look here” interjection that reframes private regret as a shared pattern, enabling a communal act. Stakes remain primarily internal/social; visible price is delicate, not bracing. Even so, the cadence shift and group participation mark an earned deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible—instilling empathy in a machine that enforces order—and they tighten when the origin vision reveals the automatons’ culpability, raising ethical and personal risk. The meaningful turn is the ritual’s activation and renaming. Pressure is more contemplative than oppositional; the automaton never challenges him, so cost and jeopardy feel muted. Still, the final hesitation in the machine reads as earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure rises via a textural deepening: the coin’s flip initiates echoes; touching it intensifies immersion and alters Elara’s options. Stakes remain mostly internal (despair vs. possibility) with no hard external squeeze or trade-off. The encore motif adds a secondary pressure for Silas that converges at closure. Escalation is clean but gentle, landing more as cadence shift than costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can they bridge their communication gap—stays coherent. Escalation deepens from uncontrolled telepathic flood to a devised navigational method and a risky sharing of interiority through art. The price is primarily vulnerability; the recall danger remains atmospheric, so cost feels more tender than sharp. One firmer foreclosed option or a concrete failure beat would lift pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (becoming the voice of the unknown) is signaled early and deepened by discovery. The decisive intensification is the float, which changes knowledge but doesn’t truly narrow options or extract a clear price. Pressure is mostly wonder, not risk; stakes feel conceptual more than felt. Escalation is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (avert burial under collapsing cliffs) is established and narrows through an intensifying method (each cataloged button shifting the echo). The reversal arrives with the final button and the hourglass turn. Agency drives all turns, but the on‑page price and foreclosed alternatives feel gentle relative to the declared scale. Tension accrues more through pattern‑intensification than direct resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (safe transmission to mend the network) is legible and tightened by choosing an impermanent, camouflaged medium. The key deepening beat is the snow-encoding method and the subsequent handoff, which narrows options and increases exposure. Stakes are more conceptual than visceral; no antagonist pressure on the page. Still, the agency-driven choice reads earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (unravel the vow and choose its ethic) is clear and tightened by the temporal pressure of the gutters slowing. Escalation is a density deepening rather than reversals; the single meaningful turn is the distilled recognition of “protection, not possession.” The price is conceptual (abandoning inherited motives) rather than felt through loss or danger, keeping tension quiet. Still, the cadence shift at the last drip is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake is singular (discover why the place endures) and tightens once the thrum fractures time. Escalation is thoughtful but gentle; danger and trade‑offs stay low, with resolution emerging from kindness rather than a pressured choice with visible loss. The decisive deepening is the navigation by light culminating in fusion. The renunciation to leave registers but could carry sharper cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—safely illuminating vulnerable creatures—is legible and coherently tightened by precise constraints (don’t flood light; align prisms). Escalation is modest but present: from petal trigger to multiple adjustments under the “quivering hush,” with small costs (exposure, precision, time). No strong reversal; the pressure remains low‑grade and steady. The resolution is earned by her endurance and care.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on whether she can repurpose isolation; escalation is a density build: hum intensifies, silhouettes unfurl, awakenings crack open. The meaningful tightening occurs as the apparitions circle her and the vibration matches her pulse, forcing a stance. The resolution—stepping back—reads as a deliberate renunciation with felt cost. While effective, conflict remains predominantly internal and controlled, limiting visceral knife-edge tension.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes—risking secrecy for connection—are legible, and the installation constitutes a meaningful tightening. Escalation remains gentle; tension rises via accumulation and public exposure rather than conflict. Resolution is earned by his act of sharing, yet coincidence (Mira’s arrival) does heavy lifting. The visible price is modest (social/emotional vulnerability), not a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prevent escalation into violence—is signaled early and tightened by the countdown to the night’s protest. Agency drives the turn; her interference produces a reversal (crowd calms, tricksters recoil). The cost remains mostly conceptual; there’s little loss or trade-off that narrows future options beyond vigilance. Tension is steady, but the pressure doesn’t quite bite.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (recover the key while enduring claustrophobia) is clear, and the meaningful tightening occurs when the initial press seems to fail, inviting doubt before the organ swells. The escalation is mostly environmental/spectral rather than consequence‑driven; Elias pays little on‑page price beyond fear. The resolution is protagonist‑triggered and coherent, just not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—naming and humanizing Jane Doe while confronting Elias’s detachment—is clear, but escalation is mostly off‑stage. The identification leap (tying the ribbon to a specific 1987 ball) feels convenient and untested by counterpressure. The memorial payoff arrives without a meaningful on‑page cost or trade‑off, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stakes are clear from the outset and tighten as the decoding yields a concrete course of action. The meaningful turn arrives when the nail’s runes align, converting hope into a plan and narrowing options. The felt price (risk to station, fear of disproving family lore) is present but not fully dramatized on the page. Pressure escalates coherently without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (make meaning of the vanishing/choose a path) tightens when the wraps align and the flake projects a route. Escalation is accumulative rather than oppositional; the breeze and light sharpen density rather than narrowing options through conflict. Elias’s agency (watching, recounting, deciding to follow the map) resolves the pressure credibly. The visible price is soft, mostly a reorientation rather than a trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect his sanctuary/legacy without repeating violence—is clear and tightened when Victor arrives. Elias’s decision to mark territory narrows options and risks losing treasured bills; the deterrence works without a fight. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the hybrid lens. A slightly greater sense of immediate jeopardy could have amplified cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (ending isolation, decoding via shared burden) is signaled and pursued. The telegram and dream vision provide one meaningful tightening, but pressure remains gentle and largely internal. The resolution feels earned but low-cost, with minimal foreclosed options. Tension rises, then resolves smoothly without a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake (retrieve and release the confession to lift the curse) escalates coherently through the expanding circles. The middle deepening (unyielding ice) forces a tactic shift and a personal surrender, narrowing options. The resolution grows from her agency (choosing to plant the seed and to “unbend” herself). The price is felt but mostly internal; a physical consequence might have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens when the nexus reveals the hidden cost to unbind, forcing a trade-off between identity/anchoring and purpose/unity. The escalation is protagonist‑driven: she initiates the link, deepens it, then chooses to sever. Stakes are coherent, if primarily internal and resolved swiftly after revelation. A single decisive tightening works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and clear: mend the brother at personal cost. Escalation tightens at the price declaration (“you will… inherit a shadow of his torment”) and culminates in an earned trade. The on‑page cost is legible and reconfigures her future options. Pressure is coherent, though the negotiation is swift, leaving limited wrangling before the acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering purpose—is clear, and the grille scrap is a credible tightening turn. However, external resistance is minimal and the negotiation with Earl carries no real risk or friction. Escalation is chiefly internal and mostly declared; the price at closure is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reestablish connection—is clear, and Elias’s agency drives the attempt. Escalation is modest: “hours passed” substitutes for pressure; no real risk or counterforce tests commitment. The tightening comes via the seed’s growth and the decision to bite, but choices never foreclose a live option. The price paid is emotional reframing, not a tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. atrium drift into ruin) is signaled early. Pressure coheres but escalates gently; the identities’ “chaotic protest” is quickly resolved by the ritual without a costly trade‑off or narrowing of options. The tightening beat exists (the forge moment) but carries little felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    One clear tightening: from inspection to ritual choice, with the misstep (“crown on head”) corrected under pressure, then committed. Stakes are primarily internal—risking vulnerability after trauma—with a legible price in surrendered isolation. External pressure is low, but coherence and escalation under the chosen lens hold. The resolution arises from Elias’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (self‑forgiveness) is clear and tightens via the storm’s pressure and the discovery of graffiti that reframes his map‑quest. The price is legible: he accepts guilt as navigable rather than erased. Escalation is modest but coherent for a quiet piece; it credibly deepens rather than reverses. The turn hinges on his agency (seeking the convergence, cross‑referencing, choosing to play/endure).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (capture unspoken words before the cycle reclaims them/letter arrives) is clear and escalates via density and a ticking dawn. The watch introduces a tactical deepening that narrows options (stretching moments to capture lines before reversal). The price paid is restraint and partiality; a sharper on‑page loss would heighten stakes. Tension is continuous without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stakes are explicit early and the clock tightens options. The coffee augury reweights choices, and picking up the violin is a genuine narrowing moment. The price—a compromised dream—reads, but its bite is softened by the “have both” solution in perforations. Tension escalates coherently to the act, though with limited visceral resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture before oblivion—is clear and tightens as Thorne’s breaths dwindle. Elara’s agency drives the deepening (placing the chip, infusing), but resistance or trade‑off beyond solemn duty is limited. The price is conceptual and ongoing rather than a sharp, contested loss. Tension operates as a calm intensification rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—help Lir accept rebirth while Elara seeks contentment—is legible, but pressure softens as conflict remains mostly internal and unopposed. Lir’s resistance is reported rather than dramatized, reducing escalation. The ritual decision is a credible tightening, yet it meets little friction or price on the page. Resolution arrives without a hard trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (to reveal a truth that may shatter illusions) is clear and tightens to “unhook” via the chime reading. The donning of the cloak and the unhooking of the logbook constitute the key narrowing. The price is more implied than felt in-body, muting intensity a notch. Still, pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether Elara will reveal and how Lir learns to tolerate absence; escalation is the concentric deepening of the ripple imagery. The tangible cost or narrowed options remain light—Lir’s frustration eases rather than forcing a trade‑off. The turn (Elara’s reveal) is earned but low‑temperature. Tension exists more in cadence than in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reconciling the wandering pulse) is legible, but pressure is largely conceptual and steady rather than escalating. The appraisal via birds provides a single deepening, yet no option is forcefully foreclosed on the page. The price—choosing motionless navigation—is more ethos than consequence, reducing tension. The ending’s hope reweights the moment without a sharp trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (recover the sacred through the keystone) with a meaningful tightening at the unstrapping. External resistance is mild—environmental rather than antagonistic—so pressure is more contemplative than acute. The release of luminance reweights options and confirms the cost of venturing into danger and risking unleashing “impossibilities.” Still, escalation could benefit from one beat of genuine jeopardy or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (discovering the color of sound), and pressure coheres around the submerged search. Escalation rises via the dive and discovery, but there’s minimal resistance or setback; cost is largely conceptual. The tightening turn is finding/activating the tag, which changes options immediately. Resolution is earned but on the easier side.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around whether she can extract meaning and align; it tightens through the targeted burst and the second, deeper distillation. The lots yield a narrowing tactic, and the revelation that she is a guardian raises personal stakes. The cost remains mostly interior and conceptual; no path is starkly foreclosed beyond committing to the role. Still, the cadence shift near the end credibly deepens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reframing grief—intensifies as light dwindles and echoes coalesce; the dusk clock tightens options. The ritual’s progression provides a decisive deepening (naming with visible artifacts) and the final act of gathering the crystals reads as an earned stance. The price is internal and clear but the conflict remains smooth, with limited pushback or reversal. Still, the cadence shift at the last ray functions as credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear—restore sea/avoid collapse—and the pressure tightens via accelerating drip tempo and viaduct tremors. Agency remains central as Elandor matches and adapts to the rates. However, costs remain relatively light and there’s no sharp reversal; escalation is effective but not punishing. The bell’s toll provides a satisfying culminating turn.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes concentrate around whether Elias will remain sealed in private grief or convert memory into shared meaning. Escalation is achieved through the photos’ increasing intimacy and the father’s label, culminating in the decision to convene descendants. The price is interior—exposure, relinquishing solitary stewardship—for a communal risk. Quiet but coherent pressure carries to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: infuse the crystal with wonder before the transformation. Pressure tightens once when the birds’ patterns demand she privilege intuition over calculation, leading to the will‑flame. Still, conflict remains low‑friction—no real risk or counterforce beyond hesitation—and the cost is primarily a tear and vulnerability. The escalation is graceful rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and coherent: protect lives and trust amidst structural failure and unstable winds. Escalation tightens when the radio contradicts the original plan, forcing a trade‑off and swift revision. Agency drives the turn, though the on‑page price is mild (no tangible loss or near‑miss). Tension is carried more by imagined peril than a dramatized setback.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (custody of self/identity and the risk of permanent numbness) are legible from early on. Pressure escalates from illusion assault to a pivot toward unity, narrowing options by reframing victory as surrender-and-merge. The visible cost is the dissolution of the win/lose paradigm and individual primacy. The turn to unity reads earned but slightly swift, reducing the felt grind at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stakes (saving his business/innovation edge) are stated early, but pressure increases modestly through reflection rather than concrete complication. The primary tightening is his choice to commit to a new room and verify the seed. There’s little visible price or foreclosed path on the page, so tension never quite bites. The result is purposeful but under‑pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and legible: restore laughter. Escalation arrives through repetition and density—each night’s persistence and the lullabies’ seep into dreams—culminating in a household shift. The cost is the continued haunting; still, the escalation is more told than felt in a single tight turn, limiting intensity. No antagonist is needed, yet a sharper mid‑beat tightening would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Conflict is primarily internal and escalates through density: mist thickens, runes ignite, the sleep‑veil deepens, culminating in a reconfiguration. The dominant stake (soothing displacement by befriending uncertainty) is signaled early and returns at the end. The tightening is real but gentle; no reversal or hard foreclosure beyond the renunciation of flight. Prices (time, endurance in cold, acceptance of exile) are felt but not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (break the curse) is pressured through successive trials that escalate cost and narrow options. The meaningful tightening occurs at the fifth attempt when insight forces a revaluation and a risky essence‑pour. Prices are paid via repeated obliteration of partial successes and the symbolic loss of the relic’s old form. Internal and external conflicts interweave cleanly without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are personal and focused (find origins within endings), with one meaningful deepening when the shard channels a rebirth signal. Escalation is primarily internal/procedural; there’s little resistance or loss that forecloses options. The perigee’s waning adds light pressure, but the outcome arrives without a hard trade‑off. Resolution is earned but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (save ferry from limbo) is clear and escalates from anomaly to entrapment to alignment attempt. Agency drives the turn via radio/frequency matching, but the process meets little resistance and exacts limited on‑page price. Pressure coheres yet never truly corners him. The conceptual aftermath offers consequence more than immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset; escalation comes via density increase—the web tightening, the sister’s emergence, and the serene eruption. The cost is acceptance and loss of the thread; a path (continued grasping) is relinquished. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed, with minimal resistance or reversal beyond the controlled unraveling. The piece earns its quiet resolution but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (unlocking star navigation) and tighten once as the projection blooms and he tests for stability. Escalation is primarily internal and procedural; there’s no counterforce beyond existential melancholy. The felt price is elegiac rather than a hard trade‑off. Resolution is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible—deliver assurance before the vulnerable voice fades—and the meaningful tightening is her decision to follow the weaker-than-usual signal and abandon her initial goal. Escalation is smooth but soft; there’s little resistance or consequence beyond the pivot. The final act resolves cleanly via her agency, but the price paid is gentle. Pressure remains coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (freeing the unremembered under a tidal clock) is clear and tightens via the move from liquid to vapor to solid. The traversal escalates coherently and narrows options, with the tide’s turn and facility tremor as credible pressure. Slight undercut: the ritual executes without a substantive setback or reversal, so the peak cost reads more as sustained endurance than a forced trade-off. Still, the price is present and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning and resilience—remains coherent, with one meaningful tightening as glitches smooth and Elara’s voice clarifies. However, resistance is low; the defragmentation proceeds with few complications or costs beyond nerves. The price paid is introspective rather than tactical, limiting pressure. Still, Alex’s agency drives the turn and the ending stance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preservation) is clear; pressure coheres through the hazardous tunnel and cursed diamond. Escalation arrives via the curse stirring and the need to sync with a live, shifting flock to avoid madness. The price paid is implied more than felt; success comes without a hard reversal or meaningful loss beyond residual strain. Still, one solid tightening (stabilization as the flock disperses) justifies the arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what she will do with her bitterness in a changed world—tightens when confession triggers the irreversible change. The phone call is a meaningful agency point that forecloses a path. Cost is legible, though largely accepted without extended friction. Pressure grows coherently under a causal lens without coincidence bailing anything out.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is clear and escalates as her playing intensifies from pause to convulsion to uprooting. Agency drives the turn, but opposition yields with limited resistance; the guardians never truly threaten her or force a trade‑off. The felt cost is modest—toppled statues convert rather than exacting a price. Pressure is coherent but comparatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—slipping messages across the smuggling border—appears early and tightens when sentinels buzz closer. Elias’s agency escalates pressure with the timed release of the storm and launch under veiled cover. The immediate price is risk; longer‑term depletion of the tool or exposure is only implied. The final recommitment under renewed drone recovery provides a credible cadence shift without a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is primarily internal; escalation is gentle but legible, with the halo fragment deepening stakes and the wind bells’ chime compressing the decision window. The dominant stake—redefining silence—tightens once, at the hum becoming song. The price of change remains soft, limiting felt consequence. Nonetheless, the resolution is protagonist‑driven and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—accessing the birthplace of stories—is signaled early and pursued via a single tightening: aligning fabric to hyperbolic curves until the scarf “shimmers.” Escalation is accumulative rather than conflictual; stakes remain mostly internal with limited pressure from time or opposition. The outcome is earned by her agency, but the cost and narrowing of options read modest. Tension exists more in cadence than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (reclaim the dream) and pressure coheres around the narrow dawn window and the islet’s whispers. The meaningful tightening is the sunrise itself, where action must succeed in a brief window. However, opposition is soft and costs are minimal; nothing on the page credibly threatens failure beyond time’s passage. The resolution is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (liberate the trapped idea/bridge the rift) is signaled early and tightened by the star’s arrival and the disorienting vortex. The decisive offering forecloses a path (keeping the keepsake) and yields the portal; cost is felt but not harrowing. Internal/external pressures interweave, though opposition is mostly atmospheric rather than resisting. Tension builds credibly if gently under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are legible (recover identity), but pressure scarcely tightens; once the method is conceived, success follows with minimal resistance. The “because/therefore” links function, yet no real option forecloses or cost bites on the page. As a result, escalation feels more procedural than fraught. Competent, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible early (reversal contingent on confrontations with shadow), and pressure coheres through Elara’s tests. The key tightening arrives with the shadow-in-glass demonstration that compels Kael’s participation. However, the path from defiance to resolution is smooth; risk and price feel low and quickly surmounted. A single escalation suffices but could bite harder.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve wonder) is clearly signaled, but there’s no credible opposition or tightening; the ritual succeeds on first attempt. Pressure does not escalate; no option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The result is soothing and assured rather than tense or earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressures tighten: each knot escalates from hush to voices to betrayal to self‑implication, culminating in the last knot choice. Agency drives turns; the confession is the price to unlock resolution. Cost is emotional and reputational rather than material, making the resolution feel a touch tidy. Still, the tightening is coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reopen hidden lore through non-coercive seeing—is steady, with one meaningful deepening when anomalies and rhythmic vibration are noticed. Pressure remains contemplative; no antagonist or material risk tests commitment. The final act forecloses forceful paths in favor of attentional stance, but the cost is modest and mostly conceptual. Tension operates, but quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular (can he reframe grief), and pressure coherently deepens with each reveal. The decisive tightening occurs when the ornament becomes device (wires/Morse), then personal stakes crest with the note. External danger remains low, but the internal price is clear: relinquishing a long‑held analytic grip as sole defense. Resolution stems from his agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (freedom vs. remaining trapped/inaudible) are signaled early and tightened by the lightning–thunder clock. Escalation is present—encoding under time pressure—yet the reversal arrives externally with Lira, and the price paid is light. The mechanism unlocks without a trade-off or visible loss. Tension is steady rather than mounting to a squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: what to do with the diary and how to meet the tower’s anguish with joy. Escalation is rhythmic via the floors, with a clear tightening at the ritual instruction and a value trade‑off in preservation. Pressure remains mostly internal; external consequence is understated, tempering the felt cost. Still, the turn is protagonist‑driven and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will absence retain memory—tightens from general scanning to the specific wound in the sky, culminating in a charged manifestation. Agency is attentional and ritualistic; choosing the void and reframing the “empty space” as subject constitutes the key turn. The cost is primarily internal; no path is strongly foreclosed beyond relinquishing doubt, so escalation feels gentle rather than pressurized. Still, the cadence shift reads cleanly and earns resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—create a boundless portrait before demolition while confronting personal limits—is signaled early and tightened by the coin’s increasing difficulty and the ticking clock. The key deepening arrives when recursion blurs her boundaries, forcing a stance about finitude. Final agency is endurance/renunciation: accept limitation, finish, and return the coin as the building’s fall nears. The cost is felt, though a sharper mid‑scene reversal could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are articulated (map the discovery) and deepen as Elias commits to a method, but pressure remains gentle and largely internal. The meaningful tightening is the recognition that the hopscotch asymmetries encode flock patterns, shifting options from wonder to actionable mapping. No real trade‑off or foreclosed path appears on the page, softening the consequence. The escalation is credible but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (learning the rhythm) is clear, and pressure tightens once with the assembly choice and the decisive “uncap.” However, opposition is largely environmental/lyric, with little resistance or trade‑off beyond nostalgia and cold. The cost is felt but soft; nonetheless, agency drives the pivotal turn. Tension lives in cadence rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (planetary stabilization) is clear, but pressure rises little; the path from clues to bell to success is linear and lightly contested. Jax’s doubt is brief and resolves quickly; no real trade‑off or loss tightens options. The meaningful turn (deciding to ring together) lacks a felt price or credible risk of failure. Escalation is present but underpowered for the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: get the lullaby through before/into the final ripple. The tightening comes via aligning nested patterns and pressing the puppet to breach the pane; the pane’s parting is the peak. Costs remain largely conceptual, with no sharp reversal or sacrificed option on the page. Tension accrues but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (guide pilgrims before frost/birds) is clear and tightens as daylight fades and frost nears. The meaningful turn is her choice to deploy the blueprint method, narrowing options and avoiding detection. Visible cost appears (spent nut; renewed duty), though the path is relatively frictionless—no on‑page setback or counterpunch. Tension sustains but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (reconnection with Lila) is clear, but pressure is gentle and faces little friction. The meaningful tightening is the shift from reflection to making/contact, yet no real obstacle pushes back. Cost is underplayed; Lila’s response arrives off‑page without resistance. The ending earns warmth but lacks a palpable test.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reach the origin—tightens as the moonlight dims and defensive fragments force a trade-off. The decisive deepening is the demand that she offer her own “parole,” foreclosing the vendor identity. Price and narrowing options are legible and linked to her tactics. Tension scales cleanly without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are focused—redeem or remain gnawed by remorse—and pressure coheres as he moves from reading to descent to absorption. The deepening is clear at the orb: he must risk being overwhelmed to achieve change. Yet there’s no real reversal, loss, or narrowing beyond the anticipated emotional flood, so tension lacks a squeeze. The price is felt but not contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes (isolation vs. connection) are clear, and escalation occurs as density: whispers → resonance → broadcast → gathering. However, resistance is light and largely frictionless; success arrives without a concrete setback or trade-off on the page. The decisive act (affixing the weight, multilingual incantations) narrows options but at modest pressure. The ending pays more in vision than in price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (self‑redefinition) is signaled early, with a single deepening as the quake jolts him into recommitment. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, consistent with the lens, but the visible price is modest. The renunciation of the old narrative (father’s disapproval, failed project shame) lands but without a sharp on‑page cost. Tension holds, never spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes (retrieve the combinations) are signaled early and remain coherent. Escalation tightens once: entry under inversion → awakened vigilance seed → attack during the grab. The price is mostly risk and urgency; no path is permanently foreclosed, and she exits largely unscathed. Agency drives the turns, but the cost could register more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is early and clear: make music in a silent world. Escalation tightens when strumming initially fails, prompting on‑the‑spot recalibration via crack analysis. The price is mostly intensity and concentration rather than a hard trade‑off; still, the beat structure deepens pressure once. Stakes remain intimate and coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: adopt a redemptive stance before the phase seals the nexus. Escalation is a density build—the hum intensifies, correlations deepen—culminating in a vow; one meaningful tightening occurs via the ticking moon. The price is implied (renouncing revenge, accepting flaws) rather than dramatized with a hard trade-off. Still, the cadence shift at peak reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around whether the clasp will yield its embedded memories, escalating via successive frequencies and specific “silences” that deepen stakes. The lock’s tremble and yield provide a tangible tightening. Opposition is gentle—more attunement than resistance—so the felt price leans inward rather than tactical. Even so, the accumulation makes the final forgiveness credible.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (adapt vs. flee; serenity within motion) is signaled early and tightens when the bloom erupts. The stench scene is the primary on‑page test; Elara’s choice to breathe and reinterpret provides agency. However, escalation is modest and the social cost is mostly inferred, with the communal decision delivered in summary rather than contested on the page. The pressure is coherent but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres under the inversion clock and hazardous arches. The key tightening arrives with the hidden grotto and the waning hour, plus collapsing arches on exit. Costs remain light—no sacrifice beyond risk and urgency—so the climax reads more as smooth retrieval than hard trade‑off. Still, agency drives each turn and the time constraint sharpens decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (uncovering cause to prevent recurrence) is coherent, and pressure tightens through the discovery of the patch and the wind funnel pattern. The escalation is primarily informational rather than jeopardy‑driven, with limited visible cost or trade‑off. Still, the mid‑story turn (human involvement possibility) deepens stakes credibly. The resolution is earned but lacks a sharp on‑page price point.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (freeing awe, “certifying wonder”) is clear, and pressure coheres via the live start cue and intensifying music. Escalation is a steady build rather than a turn with a visible price; the tremor suggests risk but never corners her into a trade‑off. Agency drives the culmination, yet the felt cost is soft. As an accumulative piece, the density increase works, if with limited squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and clear: harvest usable insight or risk repeating failure. Escalation comes through density—the silence and ritual concentration narrow options and heighten cost until the visions deliver specific corrections. The decisive turn is her acceptance of painful truths and the choice to shift strategy. While it lacks a hard external reversal, the internal pressure coheres and tightens effectively under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressured by the vanishing stars and the intensifying disorientation. A meaningful tightening occurs as the halo amplifies and identity borrowing escalates, narrowing options to a charged acceptance. Cost (self-fragmentation, the acceptance of unsolvability) is on the page. Stakes remain internal but coherent and rising under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she extend a fleeting encounter into wonder at personal cost?) is set early and tightens when she chooses to give away the pendant. Pressure rises via her risk of depleting her tools and the fragile social exchange with a skeptical stranger. The cost is clear and lasting, though the opposition remains gentle, keeping the escalation quiet rather than acute. Still, the turn meaningfully narrows her options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: can pain be externalized/absorbed. Pressure tightens through atmospheric shifts (hush) and the concrete sign (glass warmth), culminating in Marcus’s touch and mirrored pain. The escalation is quiet but decisive under the chosen lens; the car’s response narrows interpretive options. The price remains primarily conceptual/emotional, not a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—get the message across—tightens as each weave drains her life, culminating in the recommenced ritual. The cost is unmistakable: years unravel and she dissolves into the bamboo’s whispers. Pressure escalates coherently without an antagonist; the environment and method serve as constraint. A single explicit moment of doubt or a near-failure turn might have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled (revive Verdantia), and pressure coheres through the descent and ritual, but escalation is gentle with no setback or hard trade‑off. The ritual succeeds on first try; fear and cost are implied, not tested. The meaningful tightening is present (commitment to binding the silk to stone), yet it never forecloses a live option. Resolution is earned but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake is explicit early and pressure tightens at the alarm/pullback, forcing her to anchor and push deeper. The emotional cost of the brother’s defection and her imposed shame lands, though external resistance feels light and quickly overcome. Escalation is present but not grueling; reversals are brief and mostly informational. The price is more internal than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is keeping safety alight (for ships and ghosts), tightened by the lamp’s outage and the intensified hauntings. The key turn is adopting the stone-letter method as ritual in extremis, narrowing options beyond mere relighting. The price is chiefly emotional and vocational resolve rather than risk, which keeps intensity just shy of top tier. Still, pressure coheres and deepens credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (clarity versus information storms) is signaled early, and escalation arrives through intensifying light and the guided beams. However, opposition is minimal and options are not meaningfully foreclosed; the ritual proceeds largely unhindered. The prophetic laugh complicates context but doesn’t force a trade‑off on the page. Tension is lyric rather than conflict‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is stable but pressure is gentle; tracking the sun trails is a guided puzzle more than a contested risk. The tightening occurs as trails converge on the orb, reweighting knowledge rather than foreclosing options. Costs and tradeoffs are implied (caution against being consumed by tales) but not tested on the page. The mistress’s guidance reduces friction, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the need to translate sorrow into a map; escalation is a deepening of density rather than opposition, consistent with the chosen lens. The key tightening is Elias deciding to use the healed sextant and commit to the labor of measuring and mapping, shifting options from passive curiosity to active inquiry. Costs are largely internal and ergonomic (ache, emotional exposure) rather than contested by resistance. The resolution arises from his agency and reweighted understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (save a dying realm) are clear and the pressure tightens through ritual intensification and communal re‑knitting. However, obstacles are largely atmospheric rather than oppositional, and the path faces limited resistance. The price reads as exertion and risk of failure rather than a concrete loss. Escalation is coherent but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (whether to reveal/engage) tightens when the betrayer speaks and midnight strikes. The key turn is his renunciation—remaining hidden, then redirecting compassion via the note—at an emotional price. Pressure is coherent but soft; no meaningful loss beyond self‑denial is dramatized. The escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing, effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal—atonement via making the ordinary sacred—with a clear tightening when he opts for the puzzling mound and uncovers the mosaic. Pressure is coherent but low‑resistance; no antagonist or hard trade‑off beyond self‑reproach. The decisive deepening is the uncloak act, which reweights options and meaning. The felt cost is modest, keeping tension restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserve the vows before they fade—tightens with each dimming illusion, culminating in the grand, fracturing covenant. Escalation is a clear cadence shift rather than a reversal, apt for the accumulative lens. The cost is the partial, imperfect salvage under a vanishing clock. A sharper on-page trade-off or loss of a specific vow could have heightened the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular and legible: thwart Thorne and capture the sound of trust breaking. Escalation is clean via three false starts culminating in the decisive whisper to the merchant and audible rupture. Agency is Elara’s throughout; coincidence doesn’t rescue her. The price paid feels externalized (Thorne’s loss, market chaos) rather than exacted from Elara’s body or alliances.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates from intention to guided search to confrontation and answer, but opposition is gentle and the answer arrives without much resistance. The meaningful tightening is the moment the taste turns peppery and compels her toward the crevice. Consequence is primarily internal; no strong trade‑off is forced beyond relinquishing some skepticism. Tension is steady but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering the chest without damage/rekindling art) is established early, and the key tightening is the choice to engineer a non-destructive solution. The mechanism works on the first try, softening pressure and visible cost. Internal fear vs. need interweaves, but there’s little complication or reversal once the plan starts. Tension is present but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear, and escalation tightens through the honesty test, the descent, and the unlocking choice. The cost is primarily emotional rather than tactical; physical pressures rarely press back. The zinc‑plate key turn and the reread activation provide credible narrowing and payoff. A more contested or risky access beat would have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—rekindling wonder before it dissolves—are clear and escalate through the iceberg’s arrival, construction under tightening winter, and the held breath before the wind. Pressure rises by density and cadence rather than reversals; the cost manifests in endurance and the narrowing seasonal window. A single meaningful tightening occurs at the “perfect gust” beat where success or loss of opportunity hangs. The resolution is earned by her preparatory choices.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens as the magnetic peak approaches and the dome fractures. The necessary two‑step solution (contain fears, then burn/launch) narrows options and demands a trade‑off (harm to the habitat vs. survival/mental integrity). Escalation reads because/therefore, though reversals are minimal and the success feels largely uncontested. The visible price charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (unlocking communal pain and secrets) and escalate through accumulating testimonies, but friction is light and options don’t narrow under real threat. The key discovery and opening are relatively unopposed, reading more as guided reveal than tested choice. Emotional costs surface in the letter readings, though they arrive without prior acute pressure. The tightening is adequate for the length but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (escape/unlock) is legible early; pressure coheres via nightly dice rolls and the ritualized dance-decoding. Escalation reads as density increase toward a final sequence entry—appropriate to the accumulative lens. A sharper on‑page narrowing or visible sacrifice at the climax would heighten cost. Nonetheless, the method forces commitment under risk, and the liberation turn is protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering deleted memories) is clear; pressure tightens when the whale amplifies fluctuations and the grounds coalesce into a map. Escalation is primarily knowledge-based rather than forcing a painful trade-off. The ending choice to go to the whale is earned but pays a soft price on-page. A single concrete loss or immediate hazard would raise cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared (prevent cataclysm via silencing prophecy), but pressure scarcely tightens; no reversal or obstacle tests his commitment. The major “turn” is the hush descending as intended, with little price extracted. The cost implied (loss of fervor) is thematic rather than a hard constraint on options. Tension stays steady rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. mutually constructed fictions) is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s interrogation. The confession is a meaningful turn; the test with the seal resolves the dramatic question. The price—complicity in method, surrender to a constructed truth—is conceptually felt but not deeply taxed on the page. Tension scales well, if quietly, toward the activation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake with a clear clock (stars winking out), and the garden’s intensifying response supplies a decisive tightening. Agency drives the turn—Elara chooses to bind the memory rather than keep listening. The price is primarily internal, and while present, it could be sharper. The escalation is clean but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (expose imperial fraud; risk of treason) and the key tightening comes when she recognizes how to use the key and must choose to let go of blame to proceed. Pressure grows coherently but remains serene; there’s no counterforce beyond wards and self‑doubt. The price is primarily internal, which reads, but the external conflict resolves smoothly. A single, precise deepening beat rather than a hard reversal keeps this strong but not peak‑tense.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates when Thorne admits manipulation and produces the matching shell. The meaningful tightening occurs with the joining of halves, which changes options and leads to Elara’s freeing song. However, Thorne’s opposition is soft, so trade-offs and visible prices remain modest. The resolution is protagonist-driven and earned, if low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stakes (expose truth without harm) are signaled early, and escalation arrives with the visions revealing the captain’s concealed log. There is a meaningful tightening via the choice of method (guided dream sessions), but resistance is minimal and largely internalized. Costs remain implied rather than tested on the page. Tension is steady but rarely spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure accrues texturally rather than through overt obstacles; the main tightening is the shift from observation to action (whistling) that catalyzes the vow. Stakes remain internal—seeing and honoring hidden labor—so escalation is subtle but coherent under the chosen lens. The price is more conceptual than felt; no option is sharply foreclosed. Still, the cadence shift at the whistle/moon-path brightening reads as a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stakes are clear: expose truth/use the stillpoint versus maintaining protective myths and the orchard’s safety. Escalation proceeds through discovery and decoding, culminating in a morally freighted choice. Pressure is coherent but mostly internal; absence of external resistance or tangible cost on the page keeps the tightening from fully biting. The final choice forecloses a path, but its price remains implied.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is internal (allegiance crystallization) with an external echo (listeners/pilgrims). Escalation reads as density increase (more signals, then a confluence), culminating in a public declaration; that narrowing feels real though largely conceptual. Visible price is light on the page—cracked glass and exposure to lightning suggest risk but do not force an explicit trade‑off. Tension is steady but remains abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reconfiguring a lost tune into connective redemption) is clear, and the cadence tightens when he opens the jar. Escalation is internal and gentle; dawn’s call urges action but offers little resistance or trade‑off. The choice meaningfully reweights the melody, yet foreclosed options or visible price remain soft. Tension is present but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early—protect the artifact—and pressure tightens as intruders close and breach. Elias’s adaptation is the key turn; the barrier tests intent and exacts a cost in exposure and effort. Resolution feels earned but a shade easy, as the lead intruder is purified swiftly without strong counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—launching a patient revolution—tightens plausibly when the rain awakens the viaduct and Elara seizes “tonight” as the window. Escalation is linear and coherent, though largely uncontested; no reversal or live counterpressure tests the plan beyond timing. The price reads as a strategic renunciation rather than a tangible loss. The cadence shift at zenith provides the necessary beat of intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early: break the legacy’s grip and address Marcus’s death‑echo. Pressure coheres as the hum intensifies and invades her cognition, and her decision to map and counter it constitutes the tightening. The win comes quickly once the pattern is mapped; the felt price is modest, blunting the peak. Still, escalation is consistent under the Hybrid lens and resolves via her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from accusation to confession to mutual action. The meaningful tightening is Lena’s explicit dilemma and the choice to read the letter together. Costs—relinquishing anger for Lena, embracing culpability for Elias—are legible. Resolution leans a touch swift, but the shared reading grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are legible (unlock the runes to ring the unheard bell), and escalation proceeds from idea to activation to bell strike. Pressure is largely internal; there’s little resistance or narrowing of options beyond the choice to trust the translation and ring now. The awakening of leviathans supplies a credible price, but it arrives at the end and isn’t contested in the moment. One meaningful tightening lands, but the pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear early—uncovering the erased truth vs. corporate detection—and escalate: anomaly → deception → secret cache → countdown via self-erasure and AI wake. The meaningful tightening occurs when the logs begin to self-erase under detection pressure. Cost is concrete: partial loss of evidence and increased risk. The resolution grows credibly from Elara’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—bridging clans before/against the Council’s decision—is present with a ticking clock. Escalation occurs through the staged visions and the orb’s gradual reform, culminating as the horn sounds. The price is primarily opportunity/stance (refusing passivity), with limited concrete loss on the page. Still, the tightening is coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is coherent: will she surrender to death or reconfigure her relation to endings. Pressure tightens via the capsize and gale, culminating in a stance crystallization at the edge of the marina. Agency is quiet but real—continuing to trawl, interpret omens, and choose ongoing service—foreclosing the prior path. The price is primarily internal; a small concrete loss or trade-off would heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes remain focused on whether a meaningful connection can be forged and held until dawn. Pressure deepens via the burned letter and Elias’s counter-story, reweighting “mismatch” into a shared, costly acceptance of parting. Escalation is more tonal than tactical; there’s one meaningful tightening when artifacts and parallels prompt Mira’s shift. The price is understated but present: they do not become a couple; they choose charged understanding over fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is legible (preserve wisdom), but pressure stays low: the parapet awakens, yet offers no direct test or cost beyond ritual focus. The meaningful tightening is stepping from pavilion safety into the clearing and committing to consecration. No credible loss, antagonist, or trade‑off forces a sharper price, so the escalation feels smooth rather than tightening. The result is satisfying yet soft.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (collective healing via Elara’s method), and pressure deepens as more villagers engage and the vines climb. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational; options never narrow sharply, and no hard trade‑off is forced. Emotional prices are paid in recollection, not through a risky choice. Effective, but gently paced.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—proving growth within enforced stasis—is legible, with a meaningful deepening when the echoes reveal branching motifs. Pressure is largely internal and accumulative rather than confrontational; escalation comes via density of evidence rather than obstacle. The final renunciation of public proclamation for quiet demonstration narrows a path, but price is subdued. Still, the knowledge shift reweights options convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through ritualized action toward the clearing. The meaningful tightening is the convergence of markers and chalk symbols into a located nexus. The price is acceptance of impermanence rather than a tangible forfeiture; it reads and sustains tension but doesn’t bite deeply. Still, agency drives the progression and the cadence shift at the amphitheater sharpens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capturing the ephemeral before collapse—is present and pressured by the escalating tremors. The meaningful tightening is the decision to act on the leaf’s fall and to meld camera parts into the clock. The price paid remains largely internal, with external risk not biting; thus escalation feels elegant but cushioned. The resolution flows from his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—securing a flawless goodbye—tightens from private hymn to fraught, on‑page reconnection. The key deepening is Elara’s proactive reveal (holo call) that narrows options by risking rejection and ceding control. The emotional price (exposure, grief) registers without dramatic contrivance. Escalation is gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (discovering the shadows’ refuge) are clear, and escalation is coherent: small loops → larger master loop → revelation. Agency drives progress, but resistance is mostly procedural; little opposes her beyond complexity. The on‑page cost is deferred to the future confrontation, so pressure never fully bites in-scene. Solid deepening, modest risk.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling truth/forgiveness—stays focused, tightening at the ritual when tooth and bone fuse. Escalation is primarily internal, coherently deepening toward the vision. The felt price is modest; the resolution arrives with relative ease once the relic is found. Even so, agency drives the turn and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she share non‑destructive light—is set early and tightened by the weighing moment that tests intention and risk. Pressure escalates through patient labor into a charged decision to release the glow. The cost is primarily internal; external stakes for villagers remain gentle but credible. The turn is modest yet sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (redefining hurt; escaping viral scrutiny) tightens when the man appears via the same patterns she’s been reading, forcing a stance on solitude vs. connection. The escalation is quiet but real under the chosen lens, culminating in the costly choice to offer the pendant. Consequences are legible: relinquishing sole custody of a maternal relic to forge a shared narrative. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence resolving anything unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (collect hopes before dissolution) tightens through increasing current, prowling beasts, and the shell’s cutting edge, culminating in the sacrifice. Escalation is protagonist-driven via cameos and the final refusal to dissolve; cost is legible. Pressure could sharpen further with one lost or compromised attempt to underline risk. Still, the narrowing reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and time-pressured; escalation follows density increases (song intensifies, stars align, tendril glows, wind rises). However, the path is smooth—no reversal or real narrowing beyond time pressure—and no option is foreclosed by cost. The tightening is felt as cadence rather than consequence, so tension remains gentle. The resolution is protagonist-driven but not tested by sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear early (make the map before/at the eclipse), and escalation tracks via gathering, arranging, igniting, then sealing at peak. The tightening is real (eclipse as live clock) but obstacles are minimal; no reversal tests commitment beyond endurance. The cost is mostly bodily and emotional rather than a forced trade-off. It resolves through her agency at the exact pressure point, but a sharper price or complication would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around making the timer functional; the meaningful tightening arrives via the noon/dusk optical geometry and the frost‑clock of the season. Escalation is gentle—few reversals or hard trade‑offs—but tactics adapt (spring tension, timed tests) under a persistent constraint. The price paid is primarily time and disciplined attention rather than a sharp foreclosed path. It resolves cleanly, if a bit comfortably.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: wanderers arrive, the pile of weights grows, starlight fades toward dawn, forcing the meta-pattern attempt. Her agency drives escalation—adjusting the lamp, aligning with constellations, then risking self-integration. Cost is present but felt more conceptually than viscerally, tempering intensity. Still, one clear deepening—turning the collected weights on herself—narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (how to live with loss) is present early and tightens via the ticking kettle and the increasingly specific carving choices. The whistle forces a stance crystallization without drama‑dump; she forecloses numbing avoidance by choosing attentive containment. The cost is endurance over resolution; escalation is quiet but coherent for the chosen lens. A single more resistant snag (a slip, a mar in the wood) could have intensified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reconcile with ghost/self) is signaled and tightens through the ghost’s accusation and Elara’s counter-offer. The negotiation constitutes a meaningful deepening leading to stance crystallization. Prices are internal and implicit; no external option is clearly foreclosed beyond the old self-conception. Tension is steady but rarely knifes into unmistakable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (can ingenuity reanimate this ruin?) is signaled early, and the plan tightens options through the redirection gambit. But pressure never bites back: there’s little resistance, no failed attempt, and minimal cost or trade‑off on the page. Escalation reads as steady progression rather than a meaningful squeeze. The outcome feels earned yet low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (acceptance) is signaled early and tightens at the tactile turn when he touches the crystal—whispers intensify, forcing endurance over avoidance. The price (grieving a path foreclosed) is on the page and culminates in lighter-but-marked aftermath. Escalation is a single decisive deepening rather than multiple turns, apt for the lens. Stakes remain internal yet felt and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes concentrate on understanding/deconstruction rather than treasure, and pressure tightens through the salvage and the forgery reversal. The salvage beat is a concrete test; the scrolls force a choice that forecloses a path. Emotional price is legible even if physical risk is modest. Tension is steady rather than harrowing, but cadence still deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (securing timeless preservation methods) remain coherent and are tightened by the fog’s enclosure and the painstaking decoding. The meaningful turn is Elias’s coaxing yielding the weaver and the trade—an escalation in access with a felt, if modest, cost. Pressure is more contemplative than adversarial, which slightly mutes urgency. Still, agency drives the outcome rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reframing Mira’s absence—tightens through the ritual as the thread heats and directs the projection, culminating in spoken obituary and acceptance. Cost is emotional and legible (remaining alone, foreclosing reunion). Escalation is felt as a density/cadence shift rather than reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. A slightly sharper mid‑pressure complication could have heightened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (revival vs corruption) tightens as the egg’s glow reveals alteration and the palace quakes peak. Elandor’s agency escalates from assembling to calibrating breath to activating despite possible warping—an earned trade-off. The cost is legible: beauty returns imperfect, foreclosing the path to purity. Escalation is more atmospheric than adversarial, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (can scars become song?) but pressure is gentle; escalation is more cadence than conflict. The meaningful tightening is the completion of the graft and the later moment of song, with little risk or trade‑off tested on the page. No antagonist or failure beat probes her resolve. The price reads mostly in backstory and symbolic endurance rather than a live on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—liberate memories—tightens from discovery to technical unsealing. Escalation is agency‑driven (experiment, patience, targeted pressure) and culminates in a decisive act. The price (time, endurance, risking her belief-frame) is legible, though danger remains low. The turn from observation to action is clear and satisfying under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stakes (break generational loops without harm) are legible, and pressure builds as she transits deeper and faces the thicket of nascent beings. The decisive tightening is her final choice to illuminate rather than ignite, aided by the last sonar mapping. The cost remains more conceptual than felt, with minimal on‑page loss or counterforce, keeping escalation moderate. Still, the cadence shift to “unfold differently” reads as a meaningful reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (discover grief’s shape) tightens when the mentor reframes carving as weaving/sharing, forcing Elias to adopt a new tactic (ritual retracing, abstract carving). Escalation is accumulative—density of butterflies, ribbon unfurling, memory of poem‑trading—rather than reversal‑driven, but the cadence meaningfully deepens. The visible price is modest (abandoning the sufficiency of names/dates), yet it coherently charges the end. No coincidence shortcuts resolve the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    One dominant stake—restoring balance through absolution—is signaled early and tightens toward the pendulum’s suspended instant. The pause is a credible pressure point that narrows options and forces action. The price is internal and subtle; there’s no hard external counterforce on the page. Escalation lands, but consequences feel a bit too assured for peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear: decode intentions and quiet the echoes. Escalation tracks via density—voices crescendo as he untangles threads; the map discovery tightens focus to a specific grave. The resolution is earned by his action, though the price is gentle (an ache, a vigil) rather than a foreclosed alternative. A sharper trade-off or risk would have raised tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear—break the stagnation by mapping actionable futures—and pressure coheres around precision and timing. Escalation is gentle: the main tightening is the move from observation to imminent inscription. The felt price remains mostly conceptual; no option is decisively foreclosed in scene beyond her acceptance of risk. Effective for a quiet piece, but not forceful enough to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—revive stories without detection—is signaled, but escalation remains gentle: no concrete near‑miss or adaptive tactic under pressure. The key tightening is conceptual (cloaking via lyrics), not a beat that forecloses options. Risk of patrols stays off‑stage, so price never bites. The ending fulfills intent without testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve what cannot last versus concede impermanence—tightens via the final masterpiece and the chair’s stoppage. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to powder (apparent solution), then pays the price by scattering and relinquishing both portrait and persona. The felt cost is clear, including the implied end of his vigil. Pressure is internal but coherent and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (find tangible, non‑mythic evidence) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as he digs deeper with waning hope until the cog turns the screw. The escalation is primarily internal but legible; the find tightens the choice: which narrative will claim it? The price—standing against both factions—reads, though it’s more conceptual than visceral. A bit more external friction or immediate consequence would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (healing a feud via music), and escalation occurs through accumulated sessions culminating in the elder’s breakthrough. The pressure tightens gently—the “subtraction” tactic peels away hostility, but hard trade-offs or foreclosed options are understated. The price is mainly time, endurance, and the fragility of progress; no single irreversible turn tests her beyond that. The result is cohesive but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaim narratives via gentle means) is clear and deepens at the alignment peak. The meaningful tightening is “now or miss the celestial amplification,” leading to pruning and the bite. However, opposition is minimal; risk from the regime is off‑stage, so pressure feels largely atmospheric. The price paid is internal and tasteful, but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore power/renew wonder) is clear, and pressure coheres through the blackout and failed hive. The escalation is linear and competent, but the riddle-to-box sequence presents minimal resistance; no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The cost of using the box’s contents remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. Agency belongs to Elara, yet the outcome arrives with little squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preserve/understand the houses’ vitality before normality erases wonder) is established and receives a single meaningful deepening via the displaced‑objects ritual. External opposition is minimal; pressure is largely self‑generated. The turn from collecting to sanctifying functions, but the felt price is light and no path is clearly foreclosed. The ending resolves by insight rather than tested consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elara will risk the ampoule and accept what it reveals; the threading produces a clear deepening via successive revelations. Stakes are primarily internal, and external jeopardy (structural collapse, oxygen, predators) remains low, softening urgency. Still, the act forecloses a path (staying certain) with emotional cost. One meaningful tightening is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (escape/understanding) is clear and tightens as he commits to the proof. Escalation is intellectual but consequential; the tremor and door serve as the earned turn. The cost is largely conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening pressure. Still, agency drives the reversal rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (proving kindness is remembered) is present early and deepens as inscriptions animate specific histories. Escalation is largely textural—the moon intensifies, visions grow clearer, and by dawn a concrete plan materializes. The price is subtle (fatigue, anonymity, long-haul labor) rather than a pressured trade-off. One tightening beat (the decision to distribute fragments) lands but without sharp opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stakes are clear (water and culture survival), and pressure coheres into one tightening: from recognition of isolation to executing a risky plan. Agency drives the turn, with the tactic both symbolic and practical. The price paid is present but light (fuel, urgency), and there’s no sharp reversal beyond the slow thaw. Nonetheless, the narrowing of options and tangible result provide solid escalation at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through discovery → puzzle → synchronization → activation. The meaningful tightening occurs as the tide hits nadir and the beam reverses, narrowing options to a single risky initiation. The visible price is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see a concrete loss, only the risk of warped reality. Still, the pressure coheres and grows to a decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake (survive fear by stripping it of secrecy) escalates through specific turns: speaking shame, cursed photo revelation, fear’s physical approach. The cursed image is a meaningful tightening that extracts a price and narrows retreat. Resolution is driven by agency (continuing to unbosom until fear starves). The cost is felt, though there’s little residue of loss beyond the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (protecting the orchard) is legible early; escalation arrives via gathering fractal clouds and the cresting leeward tide. Agency drives the turn—he composes instead of fortifies—but the price paid remains mostly implied (fatigue, risk), not dramatized as a narrowed option or loss. The drum/whirlpool beat is a nice micro reversal. Resolution is earned and coherent, if slightly cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: seek truth from the watchers at risk of sanity and sacrilege. Escalation tightens via the taboo act, the terrible revelation, and then provoking a response with the whistle. Cost is legible (sacred violation, implied mind-shattering risk) and the final choice forecloses safety. A direct adversarial beat is deferred, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (rescue truth) is clear, but opposition is low: the lock yields, the artifact is exactly where expected. The main tightening is temporal (final petal) and the strategic pivot (avoid head‑on confrontation). Emotional cost is felt but light; no real trade‑off or loss occurs on the page. Tension stays internal and steady rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken histories—tightens with the discovery of the hidden compartment and the locket’s family echo. The “tomorrow repairs” clock and cold water add ambient pressure, though the risk feels largely internal/ethical. The wrestling beat is the clearest escalation and tests commitment. Costs register but remain quiet rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around being sealed in and the need to verify origin under failing power; the pivot to tactile searching is the meaningful tightening. The discovery reconfigures knowledge and purpose, though danger remains low and costs are mostly internal. Agency drives the turn (alternative hypothesis, vault search). A single deepening serves this length, but the felt price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief) is steady and tightens through the decision to attempt the ritual and the peak when the gem clarifies. Cost is explicit: he releases grief-wisps and gains peace but cannot restore his shadow. The cadence intensifies appropriately in the nave sequence. Slightly limited by the absence of a complicating reversal beyond internal endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake (map and reach the pools) tightens via the ticking cooldown and external wind pressure. Escalation tracks through increasing anomaly density and pursuit of the “largest cluster” to the ultimate pool; then the reboot closes the window, forcing a values choice. The felt price is primarily temporal and emotional, not material, but it’s clear. A single, clean tightening works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are legible (“frequency of belonging”), but pressure escalates smoothly without serious friction or a hard choice. Fragment retrieval proceeds without setback or trade-off, reducing felt cost. The tightening is present (completing the chip) but lacks a decisive price or foreclosed option. Tension stays lyrical rather than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular: can he transmute guilt into bearable truth. Escalation arrives via the hours of sifting and the watch hand that reframes his lie as love with cost. The price—carrying the truth without absolution—is clear, though the pressure remains quiet and could tighten once more. Resolution grows from his agency (ritual and acceptance), not coincidence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible (redemption through a flawless swap) and the timing beat (moon at zenith) provides a modest tightening. However, pressure never meaningfully spikes; no on-page setback tests his plan. Resolution is earned but comes too smoothly to register a visible price beyond internal relief. The result is steady tension rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (choose sea’s escape or walk toward repair) is clear; escalation accrues through hesitation → pocketing the compass → counting poles. The foreclosure of the kayak option is implied rather than dramatized at the brink, so cost pressure feels soft. One meaningful tightening lands, but without a concrete obstacle or loss mid‑scene. Tension remains internal and steady rather than ratcheting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake—whether he will pursue a path back to empathy—tightens through chosen risks (entering the tunnel, heeding the right path, taking the chute). The decisive act of discarding the baseball forecloses an easier nihilism. Costs are primarily internal; no strong external counter‑force pushes back beyond the puzzle pressure. Still, the because/therefore chain narrows options convincingly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (bond vs. loss of self) is signaled early and tightens when the metamorphosis starts without her full assent. The meaningful turn is her surrender to transformation, foreclosing the path of remaining human. Cost is legible and carries into the ending. Tension coheres without needing an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering lost time to earn forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens at the resistant knot requiring surrender rather than force. The key turn—using the cracked saucer to unfasten the cloth—narrows options and exacts a price (the crack widens, internal defenses drop). Escalation is more inward than perilous, so tension feels measured rather than bracing. Still, agency drives the resolution without luck doing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are focused (open the sanctuary dimension), and pressure coheres as the stitching accrues toward a final consolidation. The tightening is clear when the last photograph/self-portrait seals the shadow work and reweights options. The felt price is mostly interiorized and could show one sharper loss or risk to heighten consequence. Even so, escalation reads via cadence/intensity increase rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake tightens through the detour and rescue, then again as the fissure forecloses the original path. The release of the bugs costs him his last resource and tests his purpose. Coincidental aids (lever, runes) resolve the macro threat, slightly undercutting earned pressure. Still, the escalation from risk to communal salvation reads coherent and mounting under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (spark a silent revolution) is signaled, but on‑page escalation is modest: preparation, a brief encounter, then resumed plotting. The interruption doesn’t extract a visible price or force a trade‑off; she remains in control. The blackout complicates the sundial, prompting adaptation, yet no beat forecloses a path or raises immediate cost. Tension is present but rarely sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—use the dust and risk being fixed by fate—tightens credibly at the ritual’s midpoint (“as she placed the eighth rock… her curse showed her the outcome”). The cost is legible and paid in the ending stance. Pressure rises via density and commitment rather than antagonist; it’s sufficient at this length. A slight comfort in the resolve dampens edge, but the trade-off remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reclaim/transform voice under censorship) is clear; escalation comes via the envelope’s map and the storm’s intensification leading to the rarefaction choice. Pressure is internal and aesthetic rather than antagonist‑driven; one meaningful tightening occurs but little direct counterforce tests him. The final decision is earned but the price is largely conceptual and deferred. Solid, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—secure the exchange under threat—tightens when the rival bursts in and blades come out. Elias’s agency drives escalation (choosing to demonstrate the code, to pause the contact, to fight, then to disarm). The price is concrete: he loses the artifact to gain the maps, foreclosing a path. Danger could cut deeper (no injury or serious loss beyond the planned sacrifice), but the narrowing is credible and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (ignite “blooming resistance”) is signaled early, and pressure coheres through ritual action culminating in a vow. Escalation is more deepening than tightening: emptying the tin, scattering seeds, arranging an altar. There’s no explicit counterforce on the page and limited narrowing of options, so cost is mostly conceptual. The legacy from Jax does raise internal pressure but stops short of a felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: wrest a brief reunion from fate before night. Escalation tightens through time pressure and the precise frame‑timed entry; however, obstacles are minimal and solutions go largely unimpeded. The felt price is the finite nature of the refuge, accepted on the page. One additional complication forcing adaptation would sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is active early and tightens through the ritual’s demands and the monsoon clock; the dream interpretation is the meaningful turn. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to interpret and speak, then to test and commit to action. The price is responsibility under uncertainty rather than a concrete loss, which keeps the cost slightly soft but present. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence doing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is inward: confronting and diffusing regret; the lace‑guided method provides a credible tightening. The turn where the compass points inward and he speaks the apology is the key deepening. Escalation is steady but gentle; consequences are felt but soft, with little foreclosed alternative beyond “continue drowning.” The absence of a thornier trade‑off keeps the pressure short of high band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—Elena’s professional detachment versus personal chaos—is expertly escalated. Pressure builds through the deepening density of decay, a model of intensification for an accumulative story, forcing an earned and costly shift in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—finding purpose after trauma—and escalates the pressure through the act of discovery. The deciphering of the frost patterns acts as a meaningful tightening, forcing a choice and an action. The final reveal provides a resolution driven by protagonist agency, with the cost being the painful re-evaluation of her past and her art's origins.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake—overcoming a global silence—but the escalation is minimal. Once the key tools are discovered, the conflict becomes a largely unopposed technical and emotional procedure. The tightening comes from Elara's internal focus rather than from rising external pressure or narrowing options, making the final victory feel more inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—giving peace to the restless dead—are clear and consistent. The conflict escalates effectively when Elias enters the impossible spaces, culminating in a specific, active struggle against a resisting spirit. This beat provides a necessary tightening of pressure before the resolution, and Elias's agency is the direct cause of the final outcome, which comes at the visible cost of his exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—community cohesion versus fracturing under sanctions—is established early and tested effectively. The escalation is a deepening of internal pressure ("whispers of unrest") that forces the protagonist to act, a sufficient tightening for this lens. The cost of Elias's choice—sacrificing the safety of anonymity for the strength of open unity—is clear and legible on the page, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal stake—healing a spiritual fracture—is clear and consistent. Pressure builds as Elara commits to the ritual, deepening the stakes as she uses the crystal and her breath. However, the conflict lacks a significant test or reversal; the path to resolution is straightforward once the ritual begins. The cost is not made unmistakable on the page, resulting in a resolution that feels less earned and more like an inevitable, gentle unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a high-concept, internal stake—understanding time's texture versus escaping a psychic trap—and escalates the pressure effectively. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, applying his unique skills to overcome the obstacle. The final cost is unambiguous and directly tied to the central conflict, making the resolution feel earned and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are established early and the conflict escalates effectively via a clear external pressure—the approaching looters and the falling wall create a tangible ticking clock. The climax lands with precision, as Elias's agency directly leads to the resolution at the moment of highest tension. The cost of his action (continued captivity) is visible on the page, securing the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story's central conflict is internal, and its escalation is handled beautifully through the accumulative pressure of the ritual. The stake—achieving release from a haunting memory—is clear and personal. The deepening occurs as Elias 'hammers' the absences into the forge, a choice-driven intensification that culminates in a resolution with an unmistakable on-page cost: the full, painful, but clarifying experience of the captured sound.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding destiny—is established early and pursued consistently. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating from a "pang of doubt" to a decisive reinterpretation of her goal. This deepening of the stake is consistent with the story's accumulative lens. The resolution is earned within the story's internal logic, and the cost—leaving her thieving life behind—is clear, though the external pressure remains low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—Elias’s emotional thawing—and effectively uses the rising floodwaters as a tangible, escalating pressure. This external conflict forces a resolution to the internal one, creating a meaningful tightening of choice as time runs out. The final decision to leave is not one of convenience but of necessity, with the cost of leaving the past behind felt in the act of embedding the bookmark.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is clear and the pressure escalates effectively as the antagonist approaches, forcing the protagonist to act. The final confrontation directly tests the central conflict, with the protagonist using his agency to earn the resolution. The cost is legible as he pushes through his phobias, but the final trap mechanism feels slightly abrupt, somewhat deflating the earned tension of the build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story presents a singular, powerful stake: the preservation of memory against total oblivion. The conflict escalates cleanly under the pressure of a clear narrative clock—the dying star. The protagonist’s agency is demonstrated through her persistent, focused ritual, and the resolution is earned with a final, decisive act that carries the absolute cost of the end of all things. The tension is subtle but potent and sustained to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear, internal stake: Eko's quest for the origin of thought. Pressure escalates effectively through the accumulative act of playing the violin, where looped memories intensify and converge. This deepening of experience forces the final realization, and the cost—a transformation into a new state of being—is legible and earned through the protagonist's own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias’s mistrust versus his desire for connection—is signaled early and escalates effectively. The pressure builds as he interprets the doodles, leading to a decisive, protagonist-driven choice to risk transparency. The cost of this choice—exposing his own "frozen isolation"—is made visible on the page, resulting in a well-earned and impactful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias's personal and professional vindication against a luck-based system—is established immediately and tested directly. Pressure escalates effectively through Thorne's presence and the approaching winter. The conflict is resolved through the protagonist's direct agency and sustained effort, leading to an earned climax where the cost is legible in the bittersweet final note of ongoing decay.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—proving the theory of sideways time—and escalates it effectively. The pressure tightens when the successful experiment generates a "treacherous" temporal eddy, forcing a high-stakes choice. The resolution is driven by character agency, with Jax's action directly confronting the threat, and the cost (the discovery is too dangerous to pursue) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the code—is clear and holds throughout. However, the pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than escalating through tangible opposition or rising cost. We never feel the consequences of failure, which keeps the conflict at a low simmer. The final deepening is effective, but the lack of a clear price paid for the choices along the way mutes the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—to measure a buried truth—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating effectively through a single, meaningful deepening when Thorne introduces the botanical illustration and the method to interpret it. Elara’s agency in the final action (smudging the page) directly leads to the resolution, and the cost is made legible in the final paragraph, earning its high score.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—reconciling with a "swallowed truth"—is signaled early and effectively externalized through the exploration. The pressure deepens with the arrival of the uncanny elements, particularly the spectral worker approaching the valve wheel, which serves as a meaningful tightening of the conflict. The final resolution is driven by Alex's agency in turning the wheel, and the cost (the shattering of his skeptical worldview) is clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes an internal, existential stake—maintaining purpose against entropy—and the journey serves as the crucible. The conflict deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens when the keeper observes the distant civilization making swans, a moment that re-weights and validates his purpose. However, the pressure feels more philosophical than immediate, and the escalation lacks visceral threat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—reawakening wonder in Finn—is established early and remains the clear focus. The conflict escalates effectively toward a single, decisive moment: the eclipse. Elara’s agency in planning this shared experience provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. The resolution is earned through this action, and the cost is made visible in her sharing of the locket, foreclosing her emotional privacy for Finn's sake.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes enormous conceptual stakes—restoring dreams to humanity—but the on-page conflict is minimal. Elias faces no opposition, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs; he simply searches and finds. The pressure is static and atmospheric rather than escalating through action, and the story's deepening comes from uncovered information, not a choice made under duress that carries a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    While a dominant stake is signaled—harmony versus the chaos of revelation—the conflict itself is inert. There is no meaningful escalation, opposition, or complication; Elias executes a perfect plan without a single obstacle, which flattens tension and makes the resolution feel unearned because it was never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are cosmic yet are tested through a focused, personal confrontation. The pressure escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens, shown through the widening cracks and the entity's encroaching tendrils. The protagonist’s agency is absolute in the resolution; his specific, unconventional choice to use silence as a weapon directly exploits the antagonist's weakness, making the victory feel earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—overcoming a paralyzing homesickness for time itself—is established early and tested under coherent pressure. Escalation is effectively managed through the single, meaningful tightening of the timeframe ("before exhaustion hits"). The protagonist's agency in performing the ritual earns the resolution, and the cost is made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—freedom from an eternal cycle—is established immediately and tested relentlessly. The conflict escalates not through external opposition but through the increasing weight of her failures, a deepening of internal pressure consistent with the accumulative lens. The ticking clock of the raindrop provides a sharp, effective tightening, ensuring the final choice is made under duress with a clear and permanent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming numbness—is established immediately and tested convincingly. The arrival of Mira provides a meaningful deepening, escalating the conflict from a personal quest to a shared human experience. The resolution is earned through Elias's agency, and the cost of re-engaging with emotion is made palpable in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—solitary integrity versus worldly engagement—is established early and powerfully tested by the inciting incident. The conflict escalates internally, forcing a stance crystallization that is both decisive and costly. The resolution via renunciation feels earned, and the price—facing the encroaching chaos alone—is made starkly legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)

    The dominant stake—clinging to human time versus embracing an alien eternal now—is signaled early and sharpened to a fine point in the climax. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure escalates effectively through the deepening of Elias's ritual. The final choice presented by the being is a direct test of the core stake, and the protagonist's agency in forging a third path demonstrates a resolution earned with the undeniable cost of forgoing easy knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a clear, potent philosophical stake: to free a trapped echo and honor the beauty of incompletion. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens effectively during the ritual, as the bowl's vibration intensifies in response to the storytelling. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the conceptual cost—exchanging a contained artifact for a fleeting, shared melody—is unmistakable in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal conflict—transcending her trade by integrating its flaws—is the dominant stake, and it deepens effectively. The pressure of the ritual forces a climactic choice (to inhale the sparks), driven by Elara's agency and culminating in a poignant, legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will act on his compassionate impulse—is clear but the conflict lacks significant escalation. The pressure deepens thematically rather than heightening through rising opposition or narrowing options. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's choice, but the journey feels frictionless, with characters and motivations aligning too perfectly to generate sustained tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lirah's need to belong—is clear and compelling. However, the conflict's pressure is told rather than shown. The community's "hesitation" is overcome too easily, and the "perilous" aspects of the search are summarized rather than dramatized. This lack of a concrete, on-page test where Lirah's choices have immediate, visible costs leaves the escalation feeling conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established immediately and escalate effectively. The conflict tightens precisely when Elara realizes the cage is forged of frozen time, forcing a specific and costly solution. Her agency drives the resolution, and the price paid—manipulating the very source of her world's stability—is unmistakable and scaled perfectly to the story's length and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—resolving ambiguous loss—and escalates the pressure effectively through the focused intensity of the ritual. The climax provides a meaningful deepening of Elias's understanding, rather than a simple solution. The cost is clear and poignant: he must accept possibility over certainty, trading a painful question for a hopeful one.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story builds pressure effectively within its quiet, internal framework. The central stake—Elias's need to fulfill his purpose—is established early and gains urgency through the discovery of the tape. The escalation is textural, culminating in the confrontation with a clear choice, and the cost (surrendering his invisibility) is made legible in the final scene. The conflict feels earned and appropriately scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—Elara's control over her own body and identity—and escalates the pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Elias's need to find meaning—and deepens it effectively when the abstract quest becomes concrete with the discovery of the brooch. Mira's arrival provides a coherent pressure point, forcing a choice that redefines the initial stake. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost of the exchange (the brooch for the story) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—to harness and magnify magic—is clear, and the pressure deepens effectively from arrival to inhabitation. However, the conflict lacks a crucial element of protagonist agency at its peak. The transformation is done *to* Elara rather than being the result of a difficult choice she makes. This passivity lessens the tension and makes the earned cost feel more like a side effect than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the community's morale—is clear and the protagonist's agency drives the resolution. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively through Elara's staggered revelations, leading to a visible shift in the crowd's spirit.

Her agency in pushing through her doubt to perform the ritual makes the resolution feel earned, with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Conflict and stakes are handled with precision. The dominant stake is established early and remains the focus. The solar storm provides coherent external pressure that Elowen's agency meets, leading to a clear escalation. The climax delivers a cost that is unmistakable on the page: the amulet's destruction and the denial of a full escape, which powerfully reinforces the story's central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elena's life and Alex's moral legacy—is clear and compelling. The ticking clock of the "nightly vulnerability window" provides a good source of tension and forces a decisive choice. However, the resolution feels too perfect. The line "Alerts would come, but the math held: Elena's asylum granted, Father's debts balanced, Alex's honesty intact" resolves the conflict without a sufficient, lingering cost, undermining the gravity of the ethical breach.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict escalates effectively through an intensification of the story's central phenomenon—the lamp's hum—which aligns perfectly with the Accumulative lens. This pattern break forces a deeper engagement, leading to a revelation that dramatically raises the stakes from a personal obsession to a world-altering responsibility. The cost is clearly legible in the transformation of Elias’s purpose, foreclosing the path of the quiet custodian.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central, internal stake—rebuilding an identity from erased fragments—is signaled early and consistently deepened through the accumulative structure. The discovery of the poison label provides a powerful tightening, forcing a direct confrontation with the protagonist's own erased past. The resolution is an act of agency (acceptance and re-framing) that forecloses the path of seeking official validation, landing with the palpable cost of continued anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding a universal riddle—is established early and remains the focus. The pressure is primarily internal and atmospheric, which fits the story's lens. A meaningful deepening occurs as the compass's guidance sharpens, but the central conflict lacks a strong sense of opposition or risk; the resolution feels more like a discovery than a victory earned against tangible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the community's soul from privatization—is clear and consistently held. Pressure escalates logically with the arrival of corporate scouts and the final envoy. However, the conflict's resolution feels muted because the key actions of the resistance are summarized; we are told of the effect of the graffiti rather than witnessing a specific, tense moment of its success or failure, which lessens the felt cost of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving a vanishing moment—is established early and tested through a conflict of endurance against the elements and internal melancholy. The pressure deepens effectively with each timed message, marking progress toward the dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes clear, high stakes with a ticking clock that provides consistent tension. However, the conflict lacks escalation; Elias's method works on the first try without complication or a required adaptation. The pressure is sustained rather than tightened, making the central conflict feel more like a linear task than a dynamic struggle where the protagonist must overcome unexpected obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the quest for the rivers' source against the backdrop of survival—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure deepens effectively through the preparatory beats, culminating in a clear, protagonist-driven choice to leave the outpost. This action forecloses the option of remaining in safety and carries the unmistakable cost of confronting both the arctic wilds and a potential "personal reckoning."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—revival versus collapse—is signaled early. The conflict is a subtle battle against entropy and discord. Escalation occurs texturally as more people join the rhythm, deepening the central action and turning a solitary ritual into a communal heartbeat. However, the antagonistic force, "the collapse," remains an abstract, distant threat, which slightly lessons the immediacy of the on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—mission versus survival—is established immediately and escalates effectively through the suit's alarms and rising internal panic. The conflict crystallizes into a single, high-stakes choice: abandon the mission to surface or override instinct to complete it. The cost of this choice—her life—is unmistakable and imbues the resolution with significant weight, making her final action a powerfully earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    The internal stake of finding peace is clearly signaled and resolved through the protagonist's agency. However, the external stake—the ticking clock of "before they find the bodies"—is disconnected from the core conflict and creates no tangible pressure on Elias's actions. This lack of integration leaves the story's tension feeling purely atmospheric rather than grounded in immediate, consequential threats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—repaying the karmic debt to free the ghost—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively under an accumulative lens: each visitation brings the orchard to life while visibly sapping Elias's strength, creating a clear trade-off. The final act pays the cost on the page (her permanent departure) in exchange for the goal's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin to reverence—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. There is no opposition, setback, or moment of doubt; the path to success is unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—restoring lost faith—is established early and tested consistently through the internal conflict between skepticism and hope. The pressure escalates effectively through the multi-day excavation, with the discovery of the incomplete sundial acting as a meaningful tightening. The resolution is driven by her agency and choices, and the cost of her long exile makes the final restoration feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting dissidents from surveillance—is clear and compelling. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively, moving from a general practice to a specific high-stakes client and culminating in Elara's personal decision to perpetuate the cycle. The cost is felt implicitly through the threat of "all-seeing algorithms," which successfully charges the final moment of poised rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are high and established early. The story executes a single, meaningful escalation of pressure flawlessly for its length, moving from a general threat to the specific, dangerous knowledge of the high astronomer's treason. Elara's agency drives this escalation, and the resolution is earned entirely through her choices, with the cost being the burden of knowledge and the risk of her indirect plan.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—overcoming regret by reclaiming a moment of choice—is established early and remains the unwavering focus. Pressure escalates effectively under an accumulative lens, moving from seeking, to physical cost (blood), to emotional confrontation as the messages appear. The appearance of "his voice" provides a decisive deepening of the conflict, and the cost of resolution is the palpable pain of her sob and tears.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding hope amidst shared trauma—is internal but clear and consistently held. The pressure deepens effectively under an Accumulative lens when Elena recognizes her own past in Amir's present fear. This confrontation, driven by her agency in approaching him and decrypting the notes, leads to a resolution where the cost is the vulnerable re-experiencing of her own wounds in order to heal.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—reclaiming joy from solitude—is established early and effectively deepened. The conflict escalates when Elara decides mere glimpses are insufficient and acts to create a tangible display, a choice that carries agency. The cost is subtle but clear in the "pensive" quality of the mirth, a poignant acknowledgment of time's passage that avoids a simplistic, triumphant resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—certainty versus curiosity—and successfully escalates the pressure through the nested structure. Each awakening serves as a deepening of the conflict, forcing Elara to recommit to her choice and confront more vivid illusions.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—cognitive freedom—and escalates the pressure effectively. The conflict moves from a background threat to a direct, high-stakes confrontation. Elias's agency in planting the seed and then wielding the gourd drives the resolution. The final cost—scattering amid chaos with the regime now alerted to their new weapon—is legible and sets up future conflict, making the victory feel earned and precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming longing to achieve reunion—is established immediately. The story successfully uses an Accumulative lens to build pressure through the layering of song over time. However, the conflict is entirely internal and lacks a tangible opposition or risk of failure, which deflates the tension. The resolution is achieved through persistence alone, without a final, heightened test of Elowen's will or a surprising complication, making the escalation feel linear and the climax somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preservation against oblivion—is established immediately and tested concretely through the cracked tube. The story achieves a powerful deepening of this stake when Elara must use a painful personal memory to enact a temporary, public solution. The cost is unmistakable: the act of preservation sharpens her own sense of irreversible loss, which charges the final image beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust before a permanent separation—is established early and provides clear urgency. The timeframe of "dawn" acts as a consistent pressure, forcing Elara's hand. Her "carefully reckless gamble" is a decisive action that directly addresses the conflict, and the resolution is earned through this choice. The cost is the finality of their parting, now recontextualized with restored harmony, making the resolution feel meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the central stake is clearly established, the conflict is resolved without a palpable cost or meaningful trade-off for the opposing factions. The solution is an elegant win-win, which diminishes the tension and makes the preceding conflict feel less formidable.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will overcome his isolation—is established immediately and deepens effectively. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds internally through a series of choices: embracing the meteorite's symbolism, committing to the dust-mapping ritual, and finally training Aria. The climax is not a confrontation but a choice of profound vulnerability, with the cost—risking further heartbreak—made palpable in the line "balancing on the edge of hope and despair."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's conflict is entirely internal, focused on a single, well-defined stake: understanding sacredness to process loss. The pressure deepens effectively with the discovery of the logbook, which provides the final necessary element for his insight. The resolution is an earned stance crystallization, and the cost—accepting his tragedy as a "necessary distance"—is a profound trade-off that is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's isolation versus her desire for belonging—is established early. However, the pressure remains static for much of the story. The escalation is a single step: finding the feather prompts the ritual. The resolution feels frictionless; the spirits appear and are "captivated" with minimal resistance or complication, undercutting the tension. The cost of her final attunement is not deeply felt, making the resolution feel more like a gentle arrival than an earned victory over a significant obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding loss before memory fades—is clear and internal. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively as Elara moves from seed to seed. The resolution provides a clear reweighting of the initial stake. However, the final cost feels slightly softened; her "heart lighter" ending somewhat mutes the "gentle ache," making the trade-off feel more like a net win than a bittersweet, costly acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear, if gentle, stake: whether Elias can successfully transform a mundane moment into wonder. The conflict escalates through a well-orchestrated sequence of events. The primary weakness is the lack of palpable tension or risk; at no point does Elias's plan seem in danger of failing, which keeps the pressure low and the resolution feeling more pleasant than hard-won. The cost of failure is never felt because failure never feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving transcendence—is established early and tested with a single, potent tightening. The moment Elara becomes anchored is an excellent reversal, transforming her goal from escape to a new form of existence. The cost is unmistakable on the page, earning the final reconfiguration of her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal, with the external pressure of industrialization serving as a well-defined timeframe. The stake—seeking clarity before change—is established early and addressed directly. The story executes a single, decisive deepening of understanding through the ritual, which functions as the central turn. The cost is felt as an acceptance of loss, which is legible and appropriate for the story's meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal: Eli's need to successfully translate his pain into healing for someone else. The pressure is emotional, deepening when he chooses to open the box and share his most vulnerable story with a near-stranger. The resolution is earned within this internal framework, as Mia's tears signify that his "universal language" has been understood, fulfilling his motivation at a visible cost to her composure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes—restoring hope to dying timelines—are grand and established early. The conflict progresses via an accumulative deepening as Elara successfully tests her methods. However, the pressure on Elara is entirely external and abstract; she never seems at risk of failure, nor does she face any personal consequences or trade-offs. The "serene upheaval" keeps the conflict at a distance, reducing its visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The internal stake—overcoming her legacy's burden—is well-established. However, the conflict doesn't escalate through a genuine test or trade-off. The central challenge is resolved by finding an object that provides a complete answer, which lessens the tension. The cost is purely conceptual, and its acceptance feels frictionless once the information is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stake—transforming reality before a borrowed life expires—is established early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates not through external opposition but through the internal, temporal clock of the "borrowed heartbeat" and the "hush before bells ring." The final deepening, where success is achieved but the cost becomes imminent, is both potent and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's empire versus his quest for redemptive preservation—is established early and tested in a decisive, high-cost climax.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—awakening versus safety—and escalates pressure texturally, which is perfectly suited to the narrative lens. The central conflict tightens effectively during the untangling ritual, where Elara’s agency is paramount. The resolution is earned through her decisive action, and the cost (the court's wrath) is made unmistakable, charging the final moment with significant tension.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—Elias's artistic and ethical integrity—and escalates the internal pressure effectively. The "reversal" serves as a meaningful deepening, where Elias's decision to change his art forecloses his past profitable but deceptive path. The cost is legible (his relationship with Lena, his former career), and the resolution is earned through his agency, making the conflict's progression and conclusion feel coherent and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a clear, esoteric stake—Elias's attempt to realign reality—and deepens it effectively through the quiet intervention of the butterfly. This single, elegant turn forces a re-evaluation of his agency and success, landing with a clear conceptual cost. The conflict is subtle but potent, successfully pivoting from a man-versus-indifference struggle to a man-versus-nature dynamic that resolves through acceptance, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the global stakes are clear (preserving heritage), the on-page conflict is virtually nonexistent. Elara executes her plan without any friction, setbacks, or credible threat of failure, making the resolution feel procedural rather than earned through struggle. The primary conflict is internal and resolved before the story begins, leaving the present action without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—a philosophical question about destiny—is established early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates effectively through the storm and the discovery of the directive, leading to a deepening of understanding rather than a physical confrontation. The cost is conceptual (letting go of the past), which fits the story's tone, but its impact feels more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—sealing the covenant—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, the conflict lacks meaningful escalation or opposition; it's a procedural success story. The resolution feels earned by action but lacks a compelling price, as the "exchange" of his "frugal wisdom" for "forbidden knowledge" is presented as a net gain without a tangible trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the central stake—Thorne's resentment—is clearly established, the conflict lacks meaningful escalation or tension. Elara faces no risk, her magical tool is foolproof, and Thorne's resistance is overcome in a single beat without a significant struggle. The resolution feels like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the dream—is established early and remains the unwavering focus. Pressure escalates effectively not through external opposition, but through the internal deepening of the ritual, which aligns perfectly with the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom to mend a family legacy—is established early and tested under pressure. The physical danger of the climb effectively escalates the emotional stakes. The key turn, driven by the accidental spill, forces a choice not of action but of understanding, and the cost is legible in the humbling of Elias's initial creed of pure, willful persistence. The resolution feels earned by the protagonist's agency in accepting this new wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes the central stake—the pursuit of knowledge versus its unknown price—and executes a single, meaningful tightening with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—saving Thorne's future—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict escalates well, shifting from a simple search to a nuanced negotiation that requires intellect over force. The resolution is earned entirely through Elara's agency, using her specific skills to overcome the obstacle. The cost is legible in the binding vow, making the victory feel consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake is clear and the internal conflict is well-defined, escalating as Elara weaves her narrative. The pressure builds steadily toward the climax. The resolution, however, feels somewhat frictionless at the point of arrival, with the "recapture" culminating in a reward that doesn't feel preceded by a final, tangible sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—resolving historical absence—is clear, and pressure tightens once the door begins to vanish. This creates a functional escalation.

The lack of a genuine setback or a hard choice diminishes the perceived stakes and makes her triumph feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)

The story delivers a single, meaningful deepening of pressure as Elara reaches the fractured heart of the glacial chamber. Her agency in performing the ritual directly earns the resolution. While the conflict is more environmental than adaptive, its coherent pressure forces the necessary stance crystallization, fitting the story's length and lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—proving meaning by rekindling the beacon—is established early and remains the focus. There is a clear tightening when Elara must decipher the method using the star paths. However, the escalation deflates when the solution arrives via a sudden, precise vision, removing the tension of the search. The final conflict is resolved with minimal cost, making the victory feel more inevitable than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—preserving identity against erasure—is established early and deepens effectively with each new conjecture. The pressure escalates texturally via the intensifying storm and hush, culminating in a resolution driven by the protagonist's agency with a clear, felt cost. Its excellence is capped by execution issues in other categories.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—defying hopelessness—is established immediately and tested convincingly. The pressure deepens when Elias discovers the mosaic, forcing him into a creative act of interpretation rather than passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict is subtle, internal, and effectively escalated. The dominant stake—Elara's struggle with her departure—is clear, and the pressure of the long silence serves as a potent, unconventional antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a dominant stake—overcoming claustrophobia—and effectively tightens the pressure with a hard time limit ("the inversion hour waned").

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—Mira's search for peace—is signaled early and consistently held. Escalation operates effectively under an accumulative lens, with Elias intensifying the pressure of silence in response to Mira's resistance. The deepening occurs when Elias shares his own story, shifting the dynamic from a lesson to a moment of shared humanity, which makes Mira's final surrender feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake (claim the throne) and a compelling time constraint (before sunrise). The pressure is coherent, but the escalation is linear rather than dynamic. Elara proceeds through each challenge with the correct tool or knowledge, facing no significant setbacks, reversals, or forced trade-offs. The conflict reads as a successful execution of a pre-determined plan, lacking the friction and rising tension of a struggle against adaptive or unexpected opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—the integrity of the sanctuary versus the pull of the past—is established immediately and tested directly. Escalation is clear and driven by the protagonist's agency, from sensing the intrusion to summoning the presence. The final confrontation results in a choice with a visible cost (the permanent sealing of the threshold), making the resolution feel earned and definitive.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—alchemizing past trauma into literal wealth—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The physical pressure of the dive serves as an effective external escalation that mirrors the internal, metaphorical pressure. However, the climactic confrontation lacks sufficient tension; the obstacle of the bolt is overcome with a "makeshift lever" and "playful taunting," which undercuts the sense of a genuine, high-stakes struggle. The resolution feels pre-ordained rather than hard-won against meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—uncovering a hidden truth—is clearly established and resolved. The narrative features a significant deepening of knowledge that alters the protagonist's understanding. The core weakness is the lack of meaningful opposition or friction in the present scene; once Elias decides to act, the mechanism works perfectly, making the climax feel procedurally smooth rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elandor's internal struggle against his withdrawn life—is signaled early and effectively deepened by the discovery of the program. The escalating pressure is well-handled for an accumulative piece, manifested as reality itself warping ("reality shifted further"). The climax is a decisive act of agency with a legible cost, successfully resolving the central conflict by transforming the protagonist's state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—healing a broken heart—is established early and tested. The discovery of the file provides a meaningful deepening of this conflict, not a simple solution. The protagonist's final choice to digitize the record demonstrates clear agency, and the resolution is earned with a visible cost as she lets go of the past by disturbing the dust.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—broadcasting the truth—is established immediately and maintained throughout. The pressure escalates effectively from the initial raid to the technical glitch during the broadcast, forcing an ingenious on-the-spot solution. This final turn is driven by the protagonist’s agency, and the cost of her success (exposure and imminent danger) is made explicit, charging the ending with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central conflict is established immediately and escalates cleanly. The stakes—preventing the prophecy from unraveling fate—are high, and the opposition is felt through the prophecy's "insistent" whispers and coded visions. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the cost is legible in his enduring solitude. The escalation is a single, direct intensification rather than a complex series of reversals, which is appropriate for the story's length but stops it short of the highest tier of dynamic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of meaningful conflict and pressure. The stake—renewing the ashen skies—is grand but abstract, while the on-page actions are executed without opposition, risk of failure, or rising tension. The escalation is merely a sequence of successful steps, making the resolution feel unearned and robbing the climax of visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—precision vs. uncertainty—is well-defined and escalates perfectly. The stakes are crystallized at the waterfall's edge, where Elias must choose between his old method (retreat to plan) or his new one (improvise across the ledge). This decision is driven by his agency, and the cost of failure (death) and success (abandoning his core identity) is palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant internal stake of redemption is signaled early and escalated effectively through the accumulative pressure of the alchemical ritual. The protagonist’s agency drives the process, leading to a resolution where the cost is legible in the emotional shift from regret to acceptance. The tightening feels earned within the story's mystical framework.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    The central stake—collecting Thorne's soul—is clear and resolved with protagonist agency. The escalation, a deepening of emotional texture culminating in a tonal shift from sorrow to laughter, is effective under the accumulative lens. However, the conflict feels low-friction; Thorne's "spectral defiance" is mentioned but not dramatized, making Elara's success feel somewhat preordained and lacking a moment of true potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes internal conflict: the quest for a redemptive formula versus the agony of the trauma required to find it. The pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens, culminating in a powerful turn where she confronts her own complicity ("revealing a comrade's name"). This forces a stance crystallization, with the cost of that knowledge being unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is well-established, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation or on-page opposition. Elara faces no setbacks, and the alchemist provides the solution without any test or trade-off. While the story deepens her knowledge, the absence of any tangible friction or a difficult choice makes the resolution feel preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—releasing the trapped spirits—is established early and pursued consistently. The conflict deepens effectively when the discovery of the mainspring barrel transforms the problem from a mystery into a specific mechanical/magical puzzle. While the protagonist’s agency drives the resolution, the lack of any significant setback or trade-off makes the escalation feel linear rather than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central stake—reclaiming a lost love by shattering eternity—is both personal and immense, established immediately and held under consistent pressure. Escalation is masterfully handled as a sequence of deliberate, intensifying actions that narrow possibilities until the final, irrevocable choice. The cost of this choice is made explicit and fundamentally alters the protagonist and his world, demonstrating a mature and impactful handling of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—settling the archaeological dispute as a proxy for personal redemption—is well-defined. Pressure escalates effectively with the arrival of the temporal storm, forcing a tactical choice that carries risk. The resolution is earned directly through protagonist agency, and the cost is legible in the final lines, where the victory is framed as "fragile" and a reflection of "lost causes." The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which is handled with skill.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story establishes a world-level stake and successfully escalates the conflict from a conceptual challenge to a direct confrontation with an antagonistic force ("midnight resisted...whispering lies"). The protagonist's agency drives the key turn. The primary weakness is that the resolution feels absolute, lacking a lingering consequence or sacrifice that would make the victory feel more hard-won and the stakes fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—Elara's internal quest for a reality beyond explanation—is signaled early and pursued with convincing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes, centered on artistic purpose, are clear and are effectively deepened by the discovery of the slide. The external pressure of the storm coherently forces the internal opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story masterfully handles an internal conflict, with a stake that deepens organically from an intellectual curiosity into a profound personal and ancestral reckoning. Pressure accumulates effectively through the series of discoveries, consistent with the story's textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict escalates with palpable tension under a clear causal lens. The stakes—uncovering the truth to escape a psychic trap—are established early and tested directly.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—genuine revival versus illusory comfort—and escalates the pressure through a decisive choice. When Elias hurls the bottle away, he forecloses the magical path, a significant tightening that raises the cost of his endeavor. The conflict is primarily internal and well-realized, with his final actions demonstrating an earned resolution driven entirely by his own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: archiving a fleeting emotional state. The pressure escalates effectively when Elias's internal act of immersion produces an external, uncontrollable consequence, fundamentally tightening his options and raising the stakes from preservation to participation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—reopening the vortex—is established early and pursued with unwavering focus. The hatching of the egg provides a clear point of no return, tightening the conflict effectively for this length. The final confrontation inside the vortex supplies a legible, if brief, psychic cost ("thorns of regret"), ensuring the resolution feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—the safety of the villages—is clear, and the conflict provides a meaningful choice. However, the escalation is muted; the pressure peaks with a single, quickly dismissed flicker of doubt. The conflict resolves without a demonstrated consequence or trade-off, as the threat simply dissipates, which lessens the perceived gravity of the decision Elias made.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal stake—finding strength versus hiding in obscurity—is signaled early and effectively. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens decisively when Elara empathizes with the specific falling star, forcing a crystallization of her stance. The cost is visible in her tears and emotional vulnerability, making the final resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—resolving the unspoken regrets of the past—is established early and remains the focus.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—Elara's waning borrowed time—is established early. The conflict escalates as she uncovers layers of the puzzle, creating a solid sense of pressure. The resolution, however, weakens the impact by simply granting her more time instead of forcing a costly trade-off. The story builds tension well but resolves it too cleanly, missing an opportunity for a more powerful, earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—the drake's survival as a manifestation of fractured beauty—is signaled early and artfully deepened upon the creature's discovery. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies appropriately, culminating in a resolution driven by the protagonist's specific agency. The cost is made tangible and thematic in the drake's remaining scars, beautifully embodying the central idea that wholeness is not a prerequisite for radiance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake—creating a legacy in the face of death—but the on-page conflict lacks pressure. The primary antagonist is time and illness, yet Elias's "unyielding serenity" prevents the reader from feeling the escalating tension. The narrative states that fatigue "crept in" but fails to dramatize this struggle, making the progression feel frictionless. While the cost (his life) is clear, the journey to the resolution lacks the sense of a difficult, earned victory against tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's internal conflict over the nature of belonging—is established early and escalated effectively. The discovery of the footprints provides a meaningful tightening, transforming her solitary experiment into a shared quest and raising the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the stakes—reviving a dead world—are high, there is a complete absence of on-page conflict or opposition. The coachman's plan unfolds without a single obstacle, complication, or moment of doubt, removing all tension. The story describes a process rather than dramatizing a struggle, meaning the high stakes are declared but never feel genuinely at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively establishes a dominant stake—Elara’s search for her brother—and executes a single, meaningful tightening. The discovery of the coordinates provides a concrete path forward but narrows her options, forcing her to trust ambiguous information. The cost is legible in the riddle's warning about "half the sky," making her final choice to proceed an act of faith against a known, on-page risk. This escalation is driven by her agency in solving the riddle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story masterfully handles a quiet, internal conflict: Elara's struggle for meaning against her isolating circumstances. The dominant stake is clear, and the pressure escalates texturally, culminating in a deepening of knowledge that redefines her future. The final choice to investigate is driven by her own agency, and the cost—the reframing of her lonely existence as necessary for her unique insight—is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes grand, world-level stakes but struggles to translate them into visceral, immediate pressure during the climax. While the initial climb and infiltration create tension, the final confrontation with the awakened Archmage is resolved instantly and without struggle. This lack of a final, meaningful test for the protagonist, where he must adapt or pay a price, causes the escalation to plateau and then collapse, undercutting the narrative's tension at its most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abstract, internal conflict is handled with impressive clarity. The stake—to unbind history from obscurity—is established early and tested directly.

The cost is felt, and the climax is an earned culmination of his efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a lost self/home versus the safety of forgetting—is established immediately and escalates with precision. The discovery of the stone forces a choice, tightening the conflict from a passive ache into an active quest.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest for self-forgiveness—is signaled early and remains the unwavering focus. The conflict escalates effectively as he moves from wandering to direct confrontation with the tapestry, forcing a deepening of his internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story handles its internal conflict with masterful focus, using the accumulative structure to deepen the stakes with each stanza.

This final trade-off—her "mischievous freedom for the burden of wisdom"—is made viscerally clear and represents a powerful, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning versus dissolution—is signaled early and remains potent. Pressure escalates effectively through the rising acid sea and the diminishing timeframe of held breath. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, but as in Q2, the external conflict's clean resolution slightly lessens the visceral cost of the internal victory.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—confronting a buried promise—is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively as the physical challenge of the journey mirrors Elias's internal struggle. The wrong turn serves as a meaningful deepening of his predicament, leading to a climax where his agency (whispering the promise) resolves the central conflict with a legible cost—the shedding of his nostalgic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers can reach a lost love's spirit—is signaled early and provides a strong internal conflict. The ritual acts as a meaningful escalation. The core weakness is that the resolution is not earned by the protagonist's agency against the established stakes; it is granted by a coincidence (Mira being alive and nearby). This convenience deflates the tension and makes the final triumph feel hollow, as the actual problem was different than the one he worked to solve.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake and escalates pressure effectively through an external mechanic—the waxing moon. Protagonist agency is absolute; every step of the plot is a direct result of their choice to build. The emotional cost of this work is made explicit on the page, ensuring the final resolution is earned rather than simply achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s internal battle for psychological safety—is clearly signaled and consistently held. The pressure escalates effectively through the physical storm and the internal vulnerability required for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—decoding the stranger's mystery—is established immediately and deepens effectively. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation works perfectly as each vision adds layers of sorrow and intrigue, raising the emotional stakes for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake—finding the Doorway before the flood—and maintains tension throughout. The rising creek provides a constant, escalating pressure that forces the protagonist's hand. The pivotal choice to follow the ants is a meaningful turn driven by character agency, with the clear cost of abandoning his empirical certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of the dreams—is established immediately and pursued with agency. The pressure escalates effectively through both the perilous physical climb and the psychological weight of Elara's defiance. The climax delivers a significant deepening of the conflict, transforming a mystical quest into a political one. The revelation that her council has betrayed her raises the stakes from personal understanding to reclaiming a kingdom, and the cost of this knowledge is made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming friendship to romance—is signaled clearly by Thorne's confession. However, all narrative pressure dissolves immediately afterward. Elara's central action of creating the pocket-sun is presented without any internal or external obstacles, risks, or sense of difficulty. This lack of escalation or any meaningful test of her resolve makes the conflict static after the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—reconciling with a foreseen death—is established immediately and escalates effectively through the dream sequence. The protagonist's agency drives the key turn, transforming jealousy into the power to soar and confront the source of his fear. The cost is clear and meaningful: he cannot reclaim the ignorance of his past selves, but must instead integrate their freedom into his narrative, paying the price of detachment for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s internal search for meaning—is established early and tested effectively. The conflict escalates emotionally rather than physically, deepening when Mira’s story is revealed, which raises the personal stakes of Elara's philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and executes a single, meaningful deepening of the conflict when anxiety becomes physical paralysis. Protagonist agency is central to the resolution; Elara actively chooses her path to overcome the obstacle. The cost of this choice—revisiting past trauma—is paid on the page, making the final release from the conflict feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—achieving reconnection and delivering an apology to absolve guilt—is signaled early and tested under pressure. The conflict escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a confrontation where the cost becomes undeniable. Lila’s sharp rebuke, "mine you planted yourself," ensures the resolution is not simple absolution but a difficult, partial healing, making the emotional price feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes cosmic stakes, but the conflict remains abstract and frictionless. The opposition—"chaotic forces" and their "illusions"—is never personified or dramatized as an active force, resulting in a lack of immediate tension. The protagonist's success feels inevitable, as he faces no meaningful setbacks or difficult trade-offs. The pressure from the "universe's hiccup" is an impersonal force that deepens intensity but doesn't create compelling conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story effectively deepens its singular, philosophical stake through the countdown sequence. The pressure is internal but manifested externally in the clock's response—slowing, halting, showing fractures—which provides a tangible escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's struggle to let go—is signaled early and effectively externalized by the fungal breach. The pressure deepens when she connects the physical intrusion to her emotional state, a turn that feels earned. The resolution, her "revolutionizing" the barriers, is an active choice that demonstrates her internal shift and carries a clear cost: the final release of her grief, foreclosing the path of mourning she had been on.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a potent internal stake and escalates the pressure effectively. The transition from abstract pondering to a physical quest, culminating in the discovery of the lantern, represents a meaningful tightening that forces Elara to confront her contradictions directly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias's emotional solitude versus the need for his own connection—is signaled early and tested decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—regenerating a spiritual covenant—is established early and remains the focus. The pressure deepens effectively as the ritual progresses and twilight fades, forcing Elias's choice to immerse the locket.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully handles its central stake—Elias’s loneliness—and escalates it not through external threat, but through a deepening of internal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—rectifying a catastrophic mistake—is established early and remains central. However, the escalation is a single, direct step from problem to solution. The conflict's tension deflates at the climax because the protagonist's action faces no significant opposition or complication, and the resolution comes without a visible price, thus weakening the perceived weight of the initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s struggle against creative silence and obscurity—is established immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are deeply personal and effectively externalized through Elara’s drumming.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—proving Elias's philosophy—is established early and tested directly through the challenge. Pressure escalates via the storm and the opponent's struggles. However, the conflict's progression feels somewhat linear and inevitable; Elias's methods work perfectly while Marcus's fail predictably. The lack of a moment where Elias's plan is genuinely threatened or requires a costly adaptation keeps the tension from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—Elara’s struggle with her secret—early and effectively. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens convincingly as the guardian’s light patterns grow in intensity and meaning, forcing a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes of overthrowing a deterministic regime are high, and the conflict escalates effectively under its accumulative lens, intensifying as the "hush" peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    The central stake—Elara's quest for authentic freedom versus the cage of a peaceful but confining life—is established immediately and never wavers.

His capitulation, "Go then," marks the decisive turn, and the cost is unmistakable and beautifully rendered in his promise to wait while "fighting the emptiness."

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—safely navigating grief under surveillance—is established immediately and remains taut. Mira's arrival with the forbidden locket provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, making the abstract threat concrete. The resolution, where she leaves with a "cultivated lightness," is not a solution to the world's problem but an earned success within the scene's terms, with the lingering cost for Elias clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the dominant stake is clearly signaled and resolved through protagonist agency, the conflict lacks genuine tension. The peril associated with the colonnade is stated ("dissolve the veils...if provoked wrongly") but never felt, as the protagonist proceeds with unshakable certainty. The resolution comes without a visible trade-off or price paid, which deflates the stakes and makes the victory feel predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—Elias's perception of beauty versus reality—is signaled early and escalated with purpose. The conflict tightens through a decisive choice and reversal driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost of his final decision is both tangible (the lost reed) and conceptual (the acceptance of his 'flawed' sight).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its central conflict with precision. The abstract stake—discovering the "texture of connection"—is effectively dramatized through a series of escalating inquiries that drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s method can heal another and thus affirm his own path—is signaled early and tested effectively.

    The central stake—Marcus's need for redemption—is established immediately and effectively deepened by the introduction of the measuring tape, which elevates the conflict from personal to cultural. The resolution, achieved through Elara's agency, is earned and carries a visible cost in the confrontation with past actions. The pressure escalates coherently under the story's accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.4)
    The stakes—reclaiming pure memory versus succumbing to eternal grief—are established early and are deeply personal.

Pressure escalates beautifully as the memories intensify and the pagoda activates, leading to a resolution where the cost of success is the protagonist's own innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is established immediately and effectively deepened through the discovery of Harlan's story.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    The internal stake—rediscovering the mind's wild frontier—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens, with each grove of trees deepening the "unraveling" process in a structured intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stakes are established early and deepen effectively through a single, meaningful turn. The ritual of punching the parchment serves as a perfect focal point of escalation for this textural piece, forcing a concrete act of renunciation. This action provides a visible cost that makes the final departure feel earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elias can overcome his traumatic silence—is established early and effectively deepened by the arrival of Mira and the discovery of the bolt. This discovery doesn't escalate action, but it provides a significant conceptual tightening consistent with an accumulative drive. The final choice to remain and confront the silence represents a clear stance crystallization with a felt future cost: the risk of using his voice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake is established early and remains the unwavering focus. Escalation is handled effectively through an accumulative model, with pressure building via cryptic whispers and the rune's subtle magic, leading to visible cracks in the antagonist's composure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant intellectual stake that effectively deepens into a personal, emotional one.

The final revelation provides a resolution with a clear, legible cost—the re-evaluation of Elara's personal history and her father's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—overcoming the rebellion's lull—is established early and resolved in the climax. The story effectively builds atmospheric pressure, especially with the "thunderous serenity" motif. The tightening occurs when Elara commits to interacting with the stone, but the final resolution feels somewhat unearned because the solution appears without a significant preceding struggle or trade-off from the protagonist in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the clan's future—is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively from intellectual puzzle to a physically dangerous, tradition-shattering act. The choice to dive into the cavern is a strong point of tightening that forecloses inaction. The primary weakness is that the resolution feels too seamless; the opposition (the elders' tradition) is an abstract concept that never manifests as on-page pressure, making her victory feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story focuses on a single, potent internal stake: whether Elias will be consumed by grief's paralysis or find a way to endure. The rumble provides a sharp, effective tightening of pressure that forces this conflict to a crisis point.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear existential stake—the unraveling of reality—and escalates the pressure effectively. The conflict deepens from an external storm to an immediate physical threat (the contracting walls), forcing a high-stakes choice. The resolution is driven by the protagonist's direct agency in the climax, and the cost of his action is made explicit in the final beat, ensuring the conflict feels consequential and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's slowdown—is signaled early and remains the unwavering focus. The saboteur's actions and the fading of the ink create a coherent pressure that escalates effectively, forcing Elowen to move from theory to a high-risk action. The cost of this choice (risking his own existence for knowledge) is clear and makes the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—releasing truth versus maintaining personal safety and societal stasis—is clear and compelling. The discovery of the letter effectively raises the stakes. However, the story's escalation lacks a degree of protagonist agency; the pressure is intensified not by a choice Elara makes, but by the coincidental appearance of the networks. The final choice to transmit is a strong act of agency, and the cost is felt, but the turn that enables it feels passive.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—nurturing peace against a chaotic backdrop—is signaled early and remains the focus. However, the conflict is largely philosophical and atmospheric, lacking immediate, tangible pressure. The discovery of the scrap deepens Elara's resolve rather than escalating external stakes, which is appropriate for the textural lens but keeps the overall tension moderate. The resolution feels earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clear and the conflict, while abstract, is compellingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—control over the family narrative—is established immediately and put under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—resolving guilt—is signaled early and remains the unwavering focus. Pressure escalates effectively from discovery to the required personal sacrifice of the amber, and then to the physical cost of the tattooing. This final act represents a clear, agency-driven choice that deepens the stakes and incurs a visible cost, earning the resolution. The conflict is primarily internal but is successfully externalized through interaction with the device.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    The emotional stake—finding meaning and connection amid chaotic unease—is established early and intensifies effectively. The pressure builds through accumulated texture until Elara's interjection provides a single, decisive tightening. This act of agency is driven by the established conflict and results in a resolution with a clear, on-page emotional cost, successfully transforming the group's state.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—igniting a revolution by changing a single machine—is signaled early and escalates effectively. The retrocognitive vision of the fire's origin provides a meaningful deepening of the stakes, transforming a philosophical mission into a personal one.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant internal stake is clear and the story delivers a single, meaningful deepening when the timelines fracture. However, Elara’s agency is limited; she is largely a passive recipient of Silas’s magic rather than an active participant in her own rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The relational stake is clear from the start and meaningfully deepens after the inciting incident. The conflict escalates cleanly from an internal, chaotic problem for Alex to a shared, constructive challenge with Mia.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether Elara can find a way to voice the unknown in this new world—is established early and remains the focus.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the collapse of the cliffs—is established early and made imminent by the tremors, providing coherent pressure. Eland’s agency drives the entire resolution, as his methodical work directly leads to the solution. The escalation works well under the accumulative lens, as each cataloged button deepens his knowledge. The lack of a clear, on-page cost at the climax is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—mending the fractured spy network—is established early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates effectively from waiting (internal tension) to problem-solving (external action). The decision to use the snow as a transient code represents a meaningful tightening, a choice driven by character agency that carries a clear, on-page cost and risk, perfectly aligning with the "prudently daring" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the promise within a set timeframe—is clear and effectively resolved. The conflict is primarily internal, and its escalation reads as a coherent deepening of understanding, which is appropriate for the story's accumulative mode. The cost is legible, though its impact is more conceptual than visceral, slightly muting the tension's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear philosophical stake—to understand resistance to change—and deepens it effectively. The pressure escalates from a physical journey to a metaphysical challenge when the timelines fracture, forcing the protagonist from observation into active participation. The resolution is earned through his agency, and the cost, while conceptual, is legible in his altered perspective at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stake—protecting the fragile lives in the harbor and affirming Elara's purpose—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates through the delicate, high-precision task she undertakes, where failure means either darkness or harmful exposure for the creatures. The pressure is atmospheric but coherent, culminating in an act of agency (the careful adjustments) that directly resolves the central tension with a visible cost of effort and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story clearly establishes the internal stake of transforming loneliness and successfully deepens the pressure toward a decisive climax. The escalation is handled through an intensification of sensory and emotional experience, fitting the accumulative structure. The cost of this transformation—confronting the "raw yolk of emotion" from her past—is made explicit and visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to move from secret-keeper to self-expression to achieve connection—is established early and drives the narrative. The creation of the art installation serves as a meaningful action to address this internal conflict. The primary weakness is the lack of escalating pressure or tension in the climax; Mira’s arrival provides a solution rather than a final test, making the resolution feel soft and lacking the sharp edge of a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—the community's fracturing social fabric—is established early and escalated with precision. The conflict tightens decisively with the revelation that the tricksters aim to incite violence *tonight*, forcing the protagonist’s hand. Elara’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost of her victory is made clear in the final paragraphs, avoiding a simplistic or unearned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the key while battling claustrophobia—is clear from the outset. The internal conflict provides consistent pressure, which deepens effectively at the nexus's heart, forcing a choice. However, the resolution feels external; the "spatial mutiny" solves his claustrophobia for him, which slightly undermines the sense of agency and earned victory. The cost is present but abstract, a felt sorrow rather than a concrete loss that might alter future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—solving the case to awaken his empathy—is clear, but the escalation is minimal. The central conflict lacks a tangible obstacle, as the mystery is solved via an off-page, un-dramatized insight. This lack of a meaningful on-page struggle where the protagonist's choices have escalating costs makes the final resolution feel hollow; the price paid (softening his nature) is asserted after the fact rather than being a direct cost of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—achieving "reversible exile" to honor her ancestor—is established early and remains the clear focus. The pressure deepens effectively when the coded stanzas are revealed, transforming the task from archival research into active cryptography. The final decision to act represents a clear tightening, forcing a confrontation with the station's dread and the physical danger of the storm, making the cost of her idealism tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elias's need for meaning and redemption. The conflict deepens with the discovery of the flake, but the escalation falters because the solution is presented by coincidence rather than being achieved through the character's agency or struggle. The pressure doesn't force a difficult choice; instead, Elias passively observes the answer revealing itself, which lessens the impact of the final earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest to understand cycles and avoid his father's violent legacy—is effectively tested by Victor's arrival. The confrontation provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, forcing a choice that resolves the internal conflict. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's specific, non-violent agency, and the cost of his failed venture is palpable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the dominant stake is signaled early, the conflict lacks significant pressure or escalation. The primary obstacle—Thorne's isolation and despair—is overcome in a single, frictionless dream conversation. There is no meaningful trade-off or setback for Elara, which makes the resolution feel less like a victory over a difficult challenge and more like a simple act of empathy with a guaranteed outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Conflict and stakes are handled with precision. The dominant stake—retrieving the frozen confession to lift the curse—is established early and tested through escalating physical and magical pressure. The key tightening occurs when Elowen realizes force is useless against the ice, forcing a choice that has both an external and internal price, making the resolution feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—achieving unity—and effectively deepens it into a personal, high-stakes choice between confinement and a costly freedom.

The resolution is driven by her agency, and the cost is made explicit and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high, personal, and signaled early, with a single, effective tightening when the Keeper states the price. Elara’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost is explicit and consequential. The conflict in the climax feels more like a solemn transaction than a high-tension struggle, as the Keeper presents terms that Elara accepts without significant negotiation or resistance, slightly softening the dramatic peak.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's central stake—Jack’s search for purpose—is established early and meaningfully tightened by the discovery of the grille cloth. This single escalation forces a high-stakes internal choice, and the resolution comes at the visible cost of abandoning his emotional armor. The conflict is primarily internal but is dramatized with sufficient pressure to make the final stance crystallization feel earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with his departed wife—is established immediately. The pressure is primarily internal, and the story effectively deepens this pressure in the "liminal hush" following the spirit's departure, forcing his decision to act. Under the accumulative lens, this intensification works as the story's key turn. The resolution provides a clear reweighting of the stake, though the lack of any obstacle or complication in the magical ritual itself makes the conflict feel low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a powerful, abstract stake—preserving wonder against the entropy of a world without a future—and makes it concrete through the librarian's actions. The conflict is textural rather than causal, building through the description of chaotic identities. The librarian's decisive action of "smelting" serves as a meaningful turn that directly addresses the stake, turning discord to harmony. The cost is the eternal nature of the task, which gives the resolution its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—isolation versus connection—is established early and effectively deepened throughout the scene. Under an accumulative lens, the discovery of the confessions and the ritual instructions provides a meaningful intensification that forces a choice. The cost is legible in the flood of painful memories Elias accepts, trading his protective numbness for vulnerability and hope.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful, singular stake—self-forgiveness—and maintains coherent pressure throughout.

The cost lands effectively, transforming the absolute weight of guilt into something "navigable," a nuanced and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—documenting the words before the second letter—is established early and provides clear narrative tension. The conflict escalates effectively when Elara uses the watch, introducing the risk of being trapped in an eternal loop. This mid-point tightening is driven by her agency, and the partial resolution is earned with a legible cost (the risk taken and the new burden of knowledge).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake (dream vs. empire) and an effective ticking clock with the fading amulet. However, the central conflict is not resolved but rather circumvented. The "perforation" of destiny allows the protagonist to avoid the hard sacrifice the narrative promised, fundamentally deflating the tension and making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a clear, potent metaphysical stake: capturing a spark of essence before it vanishes. The pressure escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens as Thorne's life fades, forcing Elara's focused action. The resolution is earned, and the cost is made legible in her subsequent contemplation of her own mortality, providing a satisfying sense of weight to her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—guiding Lir to find her own contentment—is established early and tested. The arrival of the troubled soul provides coherent pressure, forcing Elara to deepen her own quest. The climax is driven by her agency, and the resolution carries a legible, if subtle, cost: the abandonment of a grander search for an external source of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dual stakes—Mara's external decision and Elias's internal crisis—are clear and effectively interwoven. The pressure escalates well within the tight timeframe, moving from a quiet conversation to a chaotic, wind-whipped moment of truth. The climax forces a decisive choice from Mara that directly precipitates the story's final, costly turn for Elias, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Lir's successful education in a profound concept—is clear and maintained. The pressure tightens effectively when Lir's frustration prompts Elara to deepen the revelation. The final reveal dramatically escalates the personal stakes of the research, providing a powerful culmination driven by Elara's choice. The conflict is primarily pedagogical but lands with a tangible cost to Lir's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Conflict is handled with nuance, focusing on a metaphysical stake (restoring the world's heartbeat) that is made tangible through the skimmer's struggle for attunement. The key turn—a deepening of knowledge rather than a physical reversal—is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and fits the Accumulative lens perfectly. The cost of his long vigil is made clear, effectively charging the final resolution with the weight of centuries.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake is well-defined, but the conflict lacks significant escalation. The obstacles—mist walking and unfastening straps—are overcome with relative ease, creating a low-pressure journey. The resolution, being entirely positive and without cost, fails to test the character's commitment in a way that would make the victory feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict escalates from a passive longing to a high-stakes physical action (the swim into the wreck).

The final choice to make a vow pays a clear price: his quest is over, but his reality is forever changed, making the cost legible in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story masterfully focuses a universe-ending stake into a deeply personal, internal conflict. Pressure escalates effectively through the ritual's stages, with each cast of the lots and act of distillation narrowing Elara's focus and deepening her understanding. The final resolution is driven entirely by her agency, and the cost—the permanent harnessing of doubt—is both clear and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—the reaper’s struggle to master his grief—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. The ritual provides a clear vector for deepening this conflict, as each named fear forces a direct confrontation with his pain. The resolution is earned entirely through the reaper's agency, and the cost is made legible in the final image of the crystalized fears, foreclosing the path of amorphous suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is clear, and the conflict escalates effectively through the mechanics of the ritual—specifically, the accelerating tempo of the dripping sapphire. This creates a tangible tightening of pressure driven by the protagonist's agency. The score is capped here because the resolution, while earned through action, lacks a visible cost or sacrifice, which lessens the stakes' ultimate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s struggle with isolated grief versus his duty as a community memory-keeper—is signaled early and deepens effectively. The pressure escalates through the increasingly personal photographs, a strong use of the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)

The conflict escalates effectively when Elara's logical preparations prove insufficient, forcing a meaningful choice to trust an intuitive sign.

The escalation is a single, potent turn, which is appropriate and effective for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—custody of a shared self and overcoming numbness—is signaled early and tested directly in the arena. The conflict escalates well from a claim to a trial, and the turning point where Kai chooses unity over domination is a strong, protagonist-driven choice that redefines the path to victory.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—seeking personal renewal—is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively through the methodical deepening of Elara's focus as she discards assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the dominant stake—saving the ferry from limbo—is clear, the conflict lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)

The climax isn't a physical confrontation but a conceptual breakthrough, and the resolution delivers a profound and legible cost: the beautiful achievement is inseparable from the grief of their isolation. This deepening of the stakes is expertly handled, turning a technical success into a poignant emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—to protect a vulnerable voice—is established early and gains urgency when it forces Elara to make a choice, abandoning her personal quest for this incidental one. This decision serves as a meaningful tightening of the conflict, driven by protagonist agency. The cost is legible and gives the resolution its weight, demonstrating a solid, if quiet, escalation of stakes that is earned by the character's established values.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)

The progression through the three phases provides a clear tightening of pressure, forcing Alex to confront his claustrophobia in increasingly hostile environments under the clock of the rising tide. The resolution is driven entirely by his agency, and the cost of the ordeal is legible in his final state, making the conflict feel earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Alex's psychological healing—is clear, and the story builds to a single point of pressure during the ritual. However, the escalation lacks genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—the preservation of a language against extinction—is established immediately and provides powerful emotional weight. The pressure escalates effectively as the storyteller enters the tunnel and confronts the curse, a direct test of his plan. The protagonist's agency in using the birds' flight patterns to overcome this obstacle is clear and decisive, leading to an earned resolution where the cost is legible in the curse's transformation and his own thrumming exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara's internal battle against bitterness—is well-defined and drives the narrative. The decision to use the arrowhead and phone creates a clear tightening of pressure, forcing a climactic choice. While the cost of her transformation is immense, the narrative immediately reframes it as "ironic joy," which makes the resolution feel slightly too neat and less of a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty against mechanical order—is established early and escalated effectively under a Causal lens.

The resulting transformation of the orchard makes the cost and resolution tangible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—smuggling a message past automated sentinels—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates effectively when the drones "buzz closer," creating a moment of genuine tension. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and clever use of his unique tool, making the success feel earned. The cost is the continued risk and the endless nature of his work, which is well-established by the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias’s relationship with his silence—is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively through the accumulation of atmospheric details, culminating in the discovery of the halo fragment. This discovery serves as the key tightening beat, forcing a confrontation with his lifelong condition. The resolution is earned under the accumulative lens, and the cost is legible in the final line: his old self is irrevocably gone, a significant and lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict is compellingly internal and conceptual, with clear stakes signaled early. The escalation is handled well for an accumulative structure, building pressure through the focused intensity of Elara's ritual. The climax delivers a decisive deepening of knowledge, and the resolution carries a visible cost in the transformation of her solitude, which is earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake—overcoming absence—and escalates the conflict by moving the character from passive longing to active pursuit. The climactic act of "sunrise photography" is a single, meaningful test that directly addresses the central problem. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency, with the emotional cost made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict escalates effectively through a single, meaningful deepening of pressure: the star-induced disorientation, which serves as a potent internal obstacle. Protagonist agency is central to the resolution, and the cost is clearly dramatized, fulfilling the narrative promise with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering a fragmented self—is established early and provides a strong narrative engine. The primary escalation point is effective: Elara recognizes she cannot repeat her past mistake, forcing a change in tactics from brute force to intelligent detection. While the stakes are high, the resolution lacks a final, tangible cost paid on the page; she reclaims her past without a closing trade-off, which makes the victory feel complete but slightly less resonant than a more costly success might have been.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—reversing Kael's exile—is clear from the outset. However, the pressure escalates and resolves too smoothly, with Kael's internal conflict being resolved with minimal dramatized struggle. The ultimate cost is stated abstractly ("face what you fled") rather than shown on the page, which significantly deflates the tension and makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is well-established. However, the story lacks meaningful escalation or pressure. Elowen identifies the problem and implements the solution without opposition, complication, or a single tactical reversal. The conflict remains a static external state that is fixed by a single, unopposed action, robbing the climax of significant tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a single, potent stake—grounding the restless spirits—and escalates the pressure masterfully.

The final turn, revealing her own bloodline's complicity, provides a sharp, costly resolution driven entirely by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear, non-physical stake: reopening ancient lore. The pressure escalates effectively under an accumulative lens, deepening from a historical puzzle to a living mystery with the discovery of the rhythmic vibration. The resolution is driven by Elias's agency—his specific method of comparison—and the cost is the necessary shift from intellectual analysis to empathetic vulnerability, which redefines the stake itself.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias's need to comprehend grief—is established immediately and drives the entire narrative. The conflict deepens effectively when the snow globe is revealed to be a puzzle, transforming the stakes from passive observation to active investigation. The resolution is earned directly through the protagonist's agency, and the cost of letting go of his old methods is made legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elowen's freedom—is clear and the timeframe "between lightning and thunder" provides coherent pressure. However, the escalation falters. Lira's arrival doesn't tighten the stakes for Elowen or force a harder choice; instead, she simply solves his problem for him. The resolution is driven by an external agent's convenient appearance, not by the protagonist's adaptation to rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—reconciling the search for joy with pervasive anguish—is signaled early and escalates effectively through the diary's revelations. The pressure deepens with each floor, forcing Elias toward a final, clarifying choice. The resolution is earned through his agency in choosing to preserve the diary, a decision that comes with the tangible cost of becoming a "keeper," thereby foreclosing the path of easy release. The conflict is focused and its resolution is meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake: proving that absence is not erasure. The conflict escalates effectively under an accumulative lens, moving from the general act of categorizing clouds to the high-stakes focus on the specific void where Mira was lost. This shift in attention represents a meaningful deepening of his quest, and the resolution is earned directly by this choice, with the cost being a fundamental transformation of his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a dominant stake—creating a masterpiece against a deadline—and effectively deepens it into a profound internal conflict.

The resolution is driven by her agency, and the cost of her revelation is made unmistakable in her shift from rebellion to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual stake—charting a great discovery—and pursues it relentlessly. The pressure escalates well as Elias pieces the puzzle together, with the discovery of the phrasebook marking a key deepening of his options. However, the conflict lacks a significant external opposition or a difficult trade-off; the primary cost is focused effort, which slightly lowers the stakes from what would be expected in top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is established early and resolved. The pressure is primarily atmospheric and internal, which is valid, but the opposition is passive; the library presents a puzzle, not an escalating obstacle. The final choice has a legible emotional cost, but the lack of active resistance keeps the tension from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes high stakes—planetary destruction—but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation or opposition. The characters follow a set of instructions without encountering significant setbacks, failed attempts, or difficult trade-offs. The primary source of tension, Jax's doubt, is resolved in a single line of dialogue without consequence. The final resolution is achieved through perfect execution on the first try, making the earned victory feel too simple and the pressure on the characters artificially low.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—to send a comforting lullaby into oblivion—is signaled early and remains the unwavering focus. The escalation is textural, intensifying as Elias approaches the pane and performs the rite, creating a quiet but potent climax. The successful transmission of the lullaby provides a resolution, but the cost—the tragic reality of his limited power—is poignantly legible, particularly in the line "his adjustment might delay the end, but never avert it."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    Conflict and stakes are established immediately and escalate under the clear, relentless pressure of the approaching night frost. The primary stake—the travelers' lives—is tangible, and the resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and unique skills. The cost is multifaceted and clear: the magical nut is consumed, and more importantly, Elara's hope for escape is once again deferred, a price that charges the final image with profound weight.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—atonement—is signaled early and pursued with clear agency. The internal deepening, prompted by the insight from the foam, is a strong turning point that focuses the character's actions. However, the final resolution with Lila feels frictionless, lacking on-page resistance or complexity, which slightly diminishes the weight of the earned reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the origin of stories—is signaled immediately and pursued relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—alleviating personal remorse—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The pressure escalates well, driven by the fading dream and culminating in a direct confrontation with the source of his pain. However, the resolution of the conflict lacks a significant, visible trade-off; the sorrow is subsumed and refined so swiftly that the victory feels pre-ordained rather than hard-won against genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uniting divided communities—is signaled early, but the conflict lacks meaningful pressure. Elara faces no significant opposition, either internal or external. Her skills are perfectly suited to the task, and potential obstacles like the farmers' skepticism are overcome with minimal effort. The story escalates in effect (faint talks to clear symphony) but not in tension or cost, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    The internal stake—redefining himself—is clear and the story deepens the conflict by moving through layers of memory. However, the escalation lacks sufficient opposition. The negative memories (father's disapproval, failed project) are presented as obstacles but are overcome through a simple act of will ("repeatedly envisioning a new narrative"). The resolution feels too frictionless, and the cost of this profound change is not made legible, weakening the impact of his ultimate success.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—retrieving the combinations—and escalates pressure effectively under a Causal lens. The conflict builds from the environmental challenge of entry to the specific threat of the "seeds of vigilance." The climax provides a meaningful test where Elara's agency, using the doodle artifact, is required to overcome the final obstacle, leading to an earned resolution with a legible cost (surviving the tendril's attack).

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—to create music in a silent world—is established early and provides a clear throughline. The story effectively deepens the conflict by moving from a general desire to a specific, focused task on the sculpture. However, the external pressure is minimal, and the brief moment of tension ("At first, nothing happened") is resolved too quickly to feel like a genuine obstacle. The conflict resolves without a meaningful trade-off or lasting consequence, softening the impact of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—finding harmony in discord—is established immediately and held under consistent pressure by the ticking clock of the nexus's phase shift.

The resolution is achieved through Elias's direct agency with a clear cost: forgoing vengeance for wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, personal stake and escalates the internal conflict effectively. The progression from the silence of "betrayal" to "loneliness" deepens the emotional pressure on the protagonist. The resolution is earned through his agency—his patient act of listening—and the final revelation carries a visible emotional cost, making the climax feel significant and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding serenity amid motion for both Elara and her village—is signaled early and tested decisively. The escalation is effective for an accumulative design, culminating when the flower's stench forces a confrontation with the story's central paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are established early and the pressure escalates effectively through the time constraint of the gravity inversion. Lira demonstrates clear agency in overcoming obstacles to achieve her goal. However, the conflict resolves without a tangible trade-off or lasting consequence, making the final success feel less hard-won than it could have been. The lack of a visible price paid at the end keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes conflict: investigator versus the chaotic aftermath of a disaster. The pressure tightens effectively with the discovery of the engineer's patch, which introduces a new variable and complicates the initial hypothesis. The resolution is earned through the protagonist’s direct agency and methodical work, with the cost of failure made manifest in the silent city itself.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story establishes a grand, abstract stake: certifying wonder for a numb world. Under the accumulative lens, the rising symphony serves as a valid form of escalation. However, the conflict remains conceptual, lacking an immediate, on-page antagonistic force or tangible threat that would force a difficult trade-off. The resolution is achieved without a significant personal cost to Elara, which limits the stakes' visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central stake—quantifying emotion—is established immediately and tested under increasing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform a mundane encounter into a moment of wonder and thus continue her mentor's legacy—is established early and tested.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story signals a clear dominant stake—proving that pain can be externalized—and escalates pressure effectively within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—delivering a message of love—is established immediately and held under constant pressure by the "impossible distance."

Elara's agency in choosing to pay this price drives the climax, and the cost (her life) is made unmistakably clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—the planet's survival—is clear, but the conflict lacks escalation. The pressure is a static environmental state of decay rather than an active opposition that adapts or intensifies in response to the protagonist's actions. Elar's journey to the climax is unopposed, and the ritual succeeds on the first try, which makes the earned resolution feel less hard-won because the struggle was not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is clear and personal, and the plot escalates from information gathering to direct confrontation. Protagonist agency drives the progression. However, the conflict lacks friction; the stated risk of being "lost in the multiverse's infinite echoes" is never dramatized, making her journey feel safe and her success inevitable. The resolution is earned through action, but the absence of a tangible struggle or setback lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—providing solace against the encroaching dark for both the living and the dead—is signaled early and powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes, while grand ("shape a new dawn"), remain entirely conceptual and are never tested by concrete, on-page opposition.

The conflict is a described state of the world rather than a dramatized struggle, making the resolution feel pre-ordained and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—understanding the nature of his new heart and of storytelling—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure is primarily internal, a valid choice for this story's mode, and the mistress's instruction provides a single, effective tightening. However, the stakes lack a clear sense of potential failure; the conflict feels more like a philosophical puzzle than a struggle with tangible consequences, which slightly softens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—to discover what trees witness—is signaled early and effectively deepened by the discovery of the sextant. This provides a tangible tool, shifting the conflict from passive wondering to active investigation.

The resolution feels earned within the story's quiet, internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the realm—is established immediately and remains the focus. Elara’s agency directly drives the resolution through a single, decisive sequence of actions.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elias can transform his pain into wisdom—is signaled early and tested decisively when he confronts the presence of his betrayer.

The conflict feels earned and scaled perfectly for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias's internal quest for absolution—is established early and effectively deepened. The pressure accumulates texturally, culminating in his decision to perform a "bolder" act.

    The dominant stake—thwarting Thorne and avenging her father—is signaled immediately and pursued with escalating intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed creativity—and escalates it effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a single, compelling dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—and pursues it relentlessly.

The resolution provides a satisfying payoff with a legible emotional cost, fully earning the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—preserving wonder against oblivion—is established effectively. The conflict deepens through Elara's escalating investment in her creation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a dominant stake—survival via resolving internal chaos—and escalates the pressure effectively.

The final choice carries a visible cost, making the resolution feel consequential rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes clear emotional stakes but fails to escalate the conflict.

This lack of rising pressure or a significant tightening turn means the resolution, while pleasant, feels unearned by genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—escape—is clear, but the story lacks meaningful escalation. The process unfolds methodically ("spider spins its web") without any significant setbacks, failed attempts, or rising external pressure that would force Elara to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost memories—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The story achieves a meaningful escalation not through direct confrontation but through a deepening of knowledge, where the coffee ground reading transforms the protagonist's understanding and options.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—averting a cosmic cataclysm—are established clearly and held throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict intensifies effectively through the layering of the ritual's components, which steadily builds pressure on the prophecy's influence.

The climax (the vow) feels earned, but the cost (future effort) remains abstract, lacking the immediate, visceral price that would elevate the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a masterful escalation of stakes, transitioning from an intellectual conflict (debunking a myth) to a profound moral dilemma with societal implications. The pressure tightens causally with the discovery of the letters, and the final reveal deepens the protagonist's choice to its maximum potential.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.1)
    This is a story almost entirely without conflict or rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)

    A strong central conflict is established with Lena's arrival, which effectively externalizes Elias's internal struggle and raises the stakes.

The shift from passive pattern recognition to the active, high-risk deception of the AI marks a decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—forging a path to unity before an external verdict arrives—is established early and maintained throughout. The pressure from the impending reply from the Council of Tides provides effective tension.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether two lonely people can forge a meaningful, albeit temporary, connection—is clear and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—preserving wisdom before it fades—remains an abstract threat that never materializes into concrete, on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will die with regret or in peace—is clear and compelling. The pressure deepens effectively when Elara's "hymning" prompts Elias to participate, a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the internal stakes are high (healing from generational trauma), they are never tested by on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore sound—is signaled early and tightens once: the heat-mapping attempt risks emotional exposure. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the silence. Cost is visible in her trembling hands and tear-brimmed eyes, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—mastery over time’s texture—faces a clear test: the retrocognitive flood threatens permanent entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.3)

Cost is visible in the cracked skepticism and the literal release of water, but the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—maintain detached witness—faces no escalating test beyond the generic passage of seasons. The “civilization folding swans” beat offers a micro-turn, but it arrives late and changes nothing on-page. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    One dominant stake—wonder vs. apathy—pressures both characters from the moment eclipse schedule locks. Eclipse’s totality forces mutual stance crystallization under coherent external pressure.

    Dominant stake (anchor breach vs stillness) is clear in “before the possession can complete.” Agency manifests in each rhetorical plunge; every loop tightens the pressure rather than relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Central conflict is Elias vs. temporal homesickness—will he conduct the future or drown in the past. One decisive tightening: he assigns memories to shell chambers, then stands before dawn; felt cost in exhaustion. No outside pressure beyond self, so escalation is modest, internal.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break the cycle of rebirth—is signaled early and tightened through each procedural branch; every timeline forecloses a false solution.

    Dominant stake—integrity vs. intervention—signaled early; pressure tightens when coordinates tempt alliance. One decisive tightening: refusal to follow the message, paid with solitude’s cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Agency clear.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why smells trigger tears—tightens once: the orchid’s bloom forces the confrontation. Escalation is accretive: scent intensifies → memories flood → collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve subjective time vs accept alien timelessness—is signaled early via the beings’ offer. Pressure deepens as rope-memento layering forces Elias to confront escalating forfeiture: freedom (give self to aliens) or knowledge (lose humanity).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompletion—tightens when the bowl’s captive song demands release; the vow to “revel in its eternal becoming” forecloses any urge to finish the melody, paying the cost of perpetual incompleteness. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to intervene with the envelope—tightens once: Elias’s ethical hesitation gives way to action, foreclosing anonymity. The cost is social and monetary (future exhibit funding), but the pressure is more reflective than urgent; the tightening is gentle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus isolation—is signaled early and tightens with each tag fragment found, foreclosing Lirah’s outsider status.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will the ritual yield a livable answer about Mira?—is signaled early. Escalation is incremental: each traced chip raises emotional stakes until the mosaic glows and the vision appears. The tightening choice is to accept an ambiguous “solution” rather than demand certainty; the price is permanent uncertainty lived with.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s choice to remain hidden versus the imperative to help—is signaled early and tightened when the tape fragment surfaces. One meaningful escalation: the tape’s memory forces him to act, narrowing his options to reveal or retreat. Cost is visible in the final beat as he slips back into the crawl space.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—face the truth of his parents’ disappearance—intensifies as each fissure-arrow narrows escape routes, culminating in the punched confession.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened when the breach offers a glimpse of “infinite possibilities” yet exacts the fragment’s shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s asylum—signaled early and escalates through Alex’s agency: decoding, waiting, breaching.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance to forestall collapse—is signaled early and escalates as footsteps accumulate. Yet the tightening is narrated rather than dramatized; we see townsfolk return in summary, not through a decisive beat that forecloses risk. Cost is communal, not personally exacted from Thorne.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“thread truth before bodies rise”—is signaled at entry and drives every beat. The lattice confession is a single, decisive tightening that forecloses further deceit, paying a social cost when the ghosts dissolve and Elias rows into incriminating calm.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—lifetimes-old debt—escalates as each cameo awakens more trees at visible cost to Elias’s stamina. One meaningful tightening: the bride’s final “debt is repaid” dissolves her and completes the orchard’s bloom, foreclosing reunion. Pressure is coherent under lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform ruin into reverence—tightens as each somnambulant intersection forecloses isolation and demands communal weaving. Cost is the nightly loss of conscious choice, legible in the dawn-after exhaustion and the irreversible alterations to the canyon.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—tightens as each artifact raises the cost of disbelief. Escalation is accumulative: sundial base → gnomon → scrolls, each reweighting options. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal. One visible price: three days’ exhaustion and the orchard’s perilous enchantment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve anonymity for dissidents via pseudonyms—tightens as dawn crowds approach and the letter remains unsealed. Escalation is textural: each decoded chalk mark increases density of risk. Cost is visible in the chalk residue and the un-mailed envelope. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and temporal.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—foil the coup via unheard stories—is signaled early and tightens once when the high astronomer’s betrayal surfaces. Cost is conceptual (knowledge that cannot be spoken openly) rather than visceral, but still legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: reclaim the suspended moment before the unsent apology hardens into permanent loss. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each traced message tightens the emotional vise until the final image of cascading script forces the stance shift. Cost is the reopened emotional wound and the irrevocable exposure of her cryptic facade. No external reversals; the tightening is internal and sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into shared hope. Anesthetic mist and child’s fear intensify through tactile unraveling of cast poems. Choice to gift coral crystallizes options, leaving both permanently altered. Agency stays with Elena; no external coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the joy must be shared to endure. One meaningful deepening: from private retrieval to communal gift. Cost is legible in the thinning fog and her relinquishing sole ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“exchange certainty for curiosity”—is signaled early and tightened through each nested awakening; every reflection forecloses the previous layer’s surety. Cost is felt in the vertigo of endless inquiry, though the visitor’s off-stage pressure keeps escalation slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting cognitive freedom—tightens when the tax doubles and drones descend. One decisive tightening: Elias must deploy the gourd now or lose everything. The price (club scattered, safe haven lost) is legible, though stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—end centuries of longing—escalates via cumulative song layers; cost is the unbroken vigil itself, but agency is more patient than active.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—“restore trust before dawn”—are vocalized early and tightened each time new promise-ink saturates the air. One clear deepening occurs: the third inscription transforms a looming dismissal into compelled witness, narrowing Thorne’s options from leave to listen. Cost is the dawn’s actual departure, irrevocable once sun shafts strike.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harmonize reverence vs exploitation—is signaled early and tightened when Elias translates Mira’s plea into mechanism. One meaningful turn: chain shifts from relic to calibration tool, foreclosing pure extraction. Cost is legible in the gate’s tremble and Elias’s shaking hands.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Central stake—will he ever transmit honest song—tightens precisely once via sending the un-reinvented message. Meteorite and dust-mote mapping are persistent constraints that alter tactics rather than solve obstacles. Cost is visible in his “withering fear giving way” though the actual price remains internal rather than external.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—tightens through each cross-referencing beat until the final reconfiguration forecloses simpler grief. Pressure grows via pattern density rather than external opposition; the cost is the acceptance that his vanishing was not accidental but essential.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake—uncover “rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early but its escalation is generic. Pressure to connect with spirits is mainly atmospheric; no rising cost or narrowing options until the ritual appears. Guardian-light dance is charming yet resolves via soft communion rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens as each seed forecloses one hypothetical trail; the glass’s transliteration supplies visible cost, but escalation is more accretive than decisive, keeping pressure steady rather than spiking.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming monotony into wonder—is signaled early and tightened when Elias must decide whether to reveal or remain hidden. The escalation is textural: density of laughter, music, and swirling papers reweights the stake rather than narrowing options. Cost is legible in Elias’s self-erasure; he gifts wonder but remains unseen. Agency is present but low-stakes; the crowd’s joy is the payoff, not his own risk.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transcendence versus enforced forgetting—tightens when the gaps widen and claim her. One decisive intensification: spontaneous anchoring forecloses physical flight while enabling spiritual fledge. Cost is legible in blood and rooted flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure tightens via impending factory intrusion and Elias’s personal ticking clock; ripple-moment crystallizes his stance. One escalation beat is clean, but the off-screen threat remains abstract, slightly blunting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turning private pain into shared language—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Eli offers the box. One meaningful deepening occurs as Mia’s tears surface, forcing Eli to confront the cost of disclosure. Agency remains with Eli; coincidence (Mia’s appearance) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate via precise gauge readouts tightening Elara’s next move. The act-symbolic cost of sending the final balloon (personal data for one distant world) forecloses further expeditions, satisfying earned reversal. One off-page resolution (war-torn variant’s sudden bloom) skirts marginally close to coincidence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show possibilities—is clear. Pressure escalates texturally via refracted light and song, but no decisive tightening or trade-off occurs; escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s bodily anchoring of the treaty—hovers vividly once introduced; pressure deepens with each spectral seal but remains textural, not causal, until the final siphoning tightens fate.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the bird’s echo vs. preserve empire—tightens once when Elias chooses release. Escalation is a single, meaningful turn under Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is visible and irreversible. Coincidence (storm) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. profitable deceit—is signaled in Lena’s shouted accusation and tightened when Elias threads the puppet-self. One meaningful deepening: from elegant lies to subversive truth-telling, with visible cost (loss of patron income, risk of seedy-bar backlash). Agency is decision, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: restoring dignity to vanished species via ephemeral monuments. Escalation is a single deepening: the monarch’s interruption forces Elias from orchestration to witness, tightening his stance under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—he abandons the arch to the wind, accepting unfinished harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Central stake (to resurrect vanished names) tightens once through rope re-patterning; no deeper escalation, but coherent pressure under accumulative lens where density of light/sound accumulation itself reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and tightened by the storm clock and the decaying directive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dream reveals paths select those ready to let old orders rot. Agency is present (she chooses to sleep and interpret), but the visible cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and tightens once: the schematic glows, portal opens, and Elias must decide to offer his vigilance. Agency is his; the sages merely ratify. Cost is visible: the tile goes inert, his future path foreclosed. Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length, though the external pressure remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—release of resentment—tightens once via cellular memory; agency is Elara’s silent persuasion, cost is Thorne’s relinquished anger. Escalation is single, coherent, and sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream—tightens once: the synchronized breathing narrows options to total boundary dissolution. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens: each inhale/exhale adds density until the mirror portal blooms. Cost is the irreversible mingling of dream and ruin; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—passing on impermanence—tightens when the notebook’s accidental fall forces Elias to enact, not preach, renewal. One meaningful deepening: the ribbon’s transformation from memento to fused artifact. Cost is visible (risky climb, shard cut, emotional exposure). Coincidence (gust) complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake—knowledge versus self-erasure—is signaled early and tightens through spectral warnings and mirror fissures. Agency is contemplative rather than active; pressure accrues but lacks a decisive on-page beat that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access to Library of Unlearned Lessons—is signaled early and tightened by guardian’s vow. One meaningful turn: renegotiation trades silence for rescue. Cost is conceptual (loss of absolute secrecy) but not viscerally felt. Agency resides with Elara’s research, not Thorne’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the twin’s silenced voice—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened through each recounted memory. Agency is exercised via spoken narrative; each story-thread narrows options until integration is the only path left. Cost is visible: the ship’s hold on her only dissolves after she relinquishes solitary identity. No coincidence resolves; fog parts as consequence, not gift.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Absence as dominant stake gathers density through each scroll; the merging act decisively narrows options—accept erasure or weave it into presence—while the visible smear of seal residue marks the price.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Energy-beings’ storm pulses escalate external pressure; Elara’s bloom choice narrows options and exacts the visible cost of absorbing that storm upon herself.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—is signaled early and tightened when the shard’s recovery becomes the test. One clear escalation: aligning prism with star paths to rekindle beacon. Cost is conceptual (years of doubt) more than visceral, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve identity before memories erode—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: deepening hush, elongating shadows, fading whispers tighten the pressure. The cost is felt in the “preemptively nostalgic ache,” but the final beat could sharpen the price paid (time, stamina, or irretrievable loss) to reach the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defy hopelessness—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (jasmine, mosaic glow, fire arcs) deepens the pressure until the final spin reweights the stake. No external antagonist; the conflict is internal and atmospheric. The tightening is the moment Elias chooses to ignite the rag, narrowing options from wandering to creating.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s departure—tightens through the lengthening pause and Kael’s indirect foresight. One meaningful deepening: the cicada’s shadow reveals Elara’s future, narrowing her options from “what if I can’t” to acceptance. Cost is legible in the cooled air and the relinquished relic.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—collect silence flavors to escape claustrophobia—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour inversion clock. Each silence gathered narrows time and raises stakes; the final gilded hush demands total isolation, a visible trade-off. Agency drives escalation: Elara chooses to seal the doll, risking permanent exile. Cost is felt when gravity reasserts and she must descend.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can silence be taught as comfort—tightens through Elias’s calibrated pauses and Mira’s rising unease. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mira’s exhale stills the vial, foreclosing her frantic option. Cost is legible: Elias must reopen his own wound to offer balm. No external coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore balance via the throne—is signaled early and tightened by the sunrise clock. Escalation occurs through peeling murals that reveal the stairway, narrowing options. Cost is visible in the irreversible merge with the throne, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to guard breathable emptiness—faces direct test when Lorin encroaches. Escalation tightens once: the threshold’s accelerating fade forces the decisive knock and release. Cost is felt in the final solitude. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turn personal trauma into communal wealth—is signaled early and tightened once: the dive forecloses retreat once pressure mounts. Escalation is causal (pressure ↑ → diamonds ↑) and felt in body and pouch. No coincidences resolve; every turn stems from Elara’s choice to twist the bolt. Cost is visible: shared diamonds imply future vulnerability to new schemes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—uncover the truth or remain cursed—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the spectral confession forces Elias to accept his role as dynasty ender. One clear escalation beat: the auditory illusion reveals the ritual, narrowing his options to renounce or perpetuate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    A single dominant stake—to seize fleeting possibility at visible cost—is declared early. Pressure tightens as reality warps around him, culminating in the irreversible release of the gauntlet. Cost is embodied, but a touch more tactic loss or price would push the elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: prove one kindness can stitch a broken soul. Escalation flows through discovery (Josiah’s kindness) → parallel (soldier’s gift) → decision (digitize). No external antagonist; pressure is internal and archival, tightening as evidence accumulates. Cost legible: each revelation deepens emotional toll; final decision forecloses anonymity, commits her public redemptive act.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve truth against erasure—tightens when drives are seized and the booth becomes last resort. One clear escalation beat: signal falter → lagoon reflection fix. Cost is legible but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy from waking guardians—is declared first paragraph and escalates beat by beat as glowing codewords thicken. Powerfully tangible cost emerges every time he abandons a note for silence, wearing memory and stamina until the final, longest void. No lucky coincidences; progression is built on his agency. One meaningful tightening turns “enough” into the final invested hush.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode falling leaves to save the gray world—escalates through monument-building and guardian summoning, each step narrowing possibilities and raising visible cost. No off-page luck; every beat intensifies under protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Elias cling to precision or embrace uncertainty?—is signaled early and tightens once: the crossing forces an either-or choice. The act of improvising with leaves and compass forecloses the old method; the price is the risk of fatal misstep and the certain loss of his former identity. Escalation is causal and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeem Aurora’s essence—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Elias chooses to risk the full zodiac cycle. Escalation is causal: Virgo precision → Libra balance → Scorpio transformation, each step raising the cost of miscalculation. The final image forecloses the option of erasing past failure; the price is the permanent visibility of golden scars.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: free Thorne’s soul by integrating laughter into his regret. Escalation is textural—each warped note tightens the sonic net until confession and laughter emerge. Cost is Thorne’s dissolution and Elara’s accumulating emotional load. Agency remains hers: she chooses lighter tones, not force. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—derive mercy’s formula—escalates via embodied trauma responses that narrow choices to forgive or fracture. Each spasm raises the cost; the final algorithm is paid for by relived betrayal and glowing sweat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightens through each painting; the final release of voices narrows options to “remember or forget,” with visible cost in the market’s hush. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: free trapped performers vs. Elias’s need to uncover ceilings’ secrets. Pressure tightens once when ghosts point upward, forcing the climb and winding. Cost is visible—spectral release leaves Elias alone—but escalation is single-beat, not cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (“compress eternity to retrieve one lost exhaled syllable”) is signalled early; pressure tightens once the perfect system destabilizes and Elias must decide between personal retrieval and communal ruin. The rupture act forces that choice onto the page, narrowing all options to “imperfect but inhabited now.” Cost is visible: eternal balance traded for a single heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove the civilization’s tyranny via the shard—tightens once the storm forces the mirror-covering gambit, narrowing options to either lose the evidence or insulate it. Cost is felt: Elias trades revolutionary action for elegiac truth. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The covenant’s decay threads through two beats: chains of rust are sung back into charged silver. Stakes tighten as ferns wilt under dishonesty, forcing a visible trade-off of hope vs resignation. Compression achieves one meaningful moral and logistical escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate forgotten alliances into living art—tightens when the slide reveals future guardians. Escalation is accretive: each vision adds layer and urgency, forcing her to sculpt now, in the storm. Cost is visceral: soaked clothes, trembling hands, open-ended guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—why night flowers bloom—tightens through postcard decoding and glass revelation; the final mural forecloses the question with earned cost. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—uncover buried betrayal—is signaled early and tightened through the debris dialogue; each message narrows options until the map is offered. Cost is felt in the “searing reverie” that scars Elias. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—authentic revival versus wish-fed illusion—is signaled early and tightens once: Elias’s rejection of the bottle narrows options to memory-driven reconstruction. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. The cost is the labor of memory and the loneliness of refusal. One deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve emotional patterns or lose human depth—escalates when Elias’s immersion accidentally seeds prophecy; the cost is the city’s structural upheaval and his own complicity, visible in the humming wax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“borrowed time”—is signaled early and tightened when the cap must be placed before the phoenix flutters away. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: failure means sealed inheritance forever. The price (phoenix lost, atrium thawing) is legible, yet the middle lacks a beat where Elara questions or risks actual bodily harm, keeping pressure one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—protect the villages via silence rather than clamor—escalates through micro-turn when Elias discards the siren option; pressure coheres under causal logic and carries visible cost: a bell left untolled, a life-path chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can vulnerability become strength?—tightens when the star’s fracture pattern mirrors her own. One decisive deepening: she chooses communion over obscurity, cost legible in the withheld sweep. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The covenant pressure tightens visibly when ghost-Mira’s presence demands Elias choose covenant preservation; cost is on the page, but single escalation beat centered on him caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“unravel time’s mysteries before her own clock unravels”—tightens when the capsule’s damage freezes her borrowed moments, forcing a rediscovery ritual. Agency is clear; cost is visible in the ash she releases.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Central tension is restoring the wounded drake; pressure tightens when Elias must harmonize internal pain with external song. Single meaningful turn: feather re-insertion mends dawn’s weave and forecloses his earlier solitude. Cost—drake flies scarred yet luminous—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—legacy of interspecies respect—tightens once: the six-month clock forces the remodel, each copper wrap narrowing Elias’s dwindling energy. Cost is felt in fatigue that never halts the work, culminating in the orchard’s luminous reciprocation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the chemistry of home—is signaled early and tightens when footprints multiply. The group’s convergence is the decisive intensification. Cost is conceptual (accepting alien implants as part of the bond) rather than visceral, slightly softening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaim death with life—tightens through each pod’s release; the heron’s lament narrows options to the eastern edge, forcing a visible trade-off (last pod gone). Pressure escalates under Accumulative pattern rather than causal reversals, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—find the brother or his fate—tightens when the cylinder yields ambiguous coordinates. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; the riddle’s warning about “half the sky” raises cost, yet the final beat leans on hope rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find meaning in exile—tightens when the anomaly redefines her isolation as opportunity. One visible cost: the irreversible solitude of the shutdown. Pressure escalates via her slowed perception, but external stakes remain largely internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—mending the sky—is signaled early and tightened by each swapped piece; the final choice forecloses the Archmage’s corrupted game. Cost is visible in the risk of plummet and the Archmage’s fury, though the personal price to Elarion remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake is the liberation of overlooked gestures from the penumbra; pressure intensifies monotonically as each spelled word tightens the acoustic noose. A single, escalating micro-turn: shadow shifts, Alex accelerates, word choice escalates from “release” to “historian,” trading safety for stewardship. Cost—Alex abandons anonymous comfort and takes responsibility for every muted bow and polish—lands legibly on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the shape of home via unburied talent—is signaled early and tightened when the stone’s glow forces Elara to trade painless illusion for raw memory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes flip from “undo the curse” to “unravel my fault”; the tapestry’s border itself turns adversary. One tightening through string-thread decoding narrows options until forgiveness becomes the only exit, generating a felt cognitive toll.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—gaining absolution by fracturing guilt—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through each poetry beat, narrowing her options from denial to surrender of innocence. Cost is visible in her tempered defiance at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“salvage purpose from oblivion”—is signaled early and escalates as each breathless beat narrows options. The acid sea’s rising pressure forces the final quilting act; cost is felt in burning lungs and corroded hull, though external threat resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—release the past or remain chained—tightens once in the grotto when the illusion’s fade forces the vow. Agency: Elias’s whispered renunciation narrows options; cost is the emotional tear-tide. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving intent can reach the lost—is clear early; pressure tightens as Elias performs the ritual. However, escalation hinges on an off-stage miracle rather than a narrowing of options or visible cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reverse-migrate fragments of the self and others—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation tracks moon phases tightening options; each midnight call raises clarity and stakes.

No coincidence resolves; all pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—answering the stranger’s plea—sharpens via escalating memory fragments until renunciation is no longer an option; visible cost is Elias’s forfeiture of untouchable isolation when he “stepped back into the twilight, no longer alone.”

    Stake (promise to find doorway) escalates under rising creek deadline. One decisive turn: he abandons the map—cost is clear and option narrows, pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform friendship into romance—is signaled early and tightened when Elara steps through the portal, risking permanent change. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the potential loss of what they had.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reconciling foreseen death with lived freedom—tightens once when the narrator chooses to chronicle rather than relive; cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is emotional healing via tangible continuity; it tightens once when Mira’s fear is voiced then answered by Elara’s mirrored wound.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—grasping what clocks truly measure—tightens through each counted memory, narrowing possibility to the razor-edge moment. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the felt cost at the end is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protect the crop while mastering release—tightens once when the breach forces Elara to risk her emotional barrier model. Agency is hers: she chooses recalibration, paying with the ache of finally exhaling the past.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Primary stake—“how to confront uncertainty responsibly”—narrows steadily: graffiti, lantern, final vow. Price visible: she extinguishes flame, forfeits absolute control. Causal linkage holds; escalation is deepening, not added threats.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to teach endings—tightens when the musician pierces the veil, forcing Elias to endure his own lesson. One clear escalation: the unexpected callback collapses operator distance. Cost is visible in the dawn’s approach and Elias’s decision to surface.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom to embody true self—tightens each time the scrimshaw demands another heart-shattering moment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—how to mourn without detection—tightens once: Mira’s arrival forces Elias to risk exposure. The whittling-as-camouflage escalates the danger, and the final hand-off exacts a visible moral price, though the beat count is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to discover the texture of connection”—is tested by each voiced doubt.

Cost is visible in the cracked glass and the slowed glider.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—purify nostalgia without losing self—is signaled early and tightened by the “avoid patterns” rule. Escalation is one deepening: each purified atom exacts a pang, narrowing options until collapse. Cost is visceral and on-page. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened when the unbound shadow begins eroding archived dreams.

    Dominant stake: recover lost mental wilderness. Escalation is textural—each grove adds a timbral layer that tightens the psychological vise.

Sufficient tightening for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure builds through each beat of drift: subtle doubts accrete under the inverted lens until Vesper’s identity dissolves with crystallized cost. Stakes remain mortal—threat to Order—while escalation and resource depletion are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—why migration routes vanished—tightens when each tapped rhythm eliminates a false hypothesis, narrowing to the submerged-truth payoff. Pressure is coherent but external; the storm and rising alerts complicate without forcing a counter-move from Elara until the final transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—why time slows in crisis—signaled early and tightened when sabotage threatens the quest. Escalation: sabotage → ink fade → disappearance → neural insight, each narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—continuity vs. chaos—signaled early and deepened through each beat: discovery of scrap, crafting sheath, tending roses.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture vs. release of the goddess-echo—tightens once when Eron hooks and then frees it. The cost is visible (loss of possession), but the pressure curve is gentle; a sharper mid-scene trade-off would have lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)

    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and tightened through the mandala ritual. Pressure escalates as lilac unease intensifies and whispers crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—awaken mercy in a machine—tightens once: renaming forecloses Elias’s anonymity and risks retaliation. The cost is felt in the Guardian’s hesitation and Elias’s unchanged retrocognitive curse. Pressure is coherent but single-turn; no secondary escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (escape from despair) is signaled early and tightened through synesthetic intensification and the coin’s temporal echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can they bridge communication—tightens once: chaotic telepathy → devised somatic map → joint creation. Agency is Alex’s throughout; coincidence (shock) only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mend the shattered agent network—tightens when the only safe conduit is vanishing snow. One decisive deepening: handing over the pillbox relinquishes sole control, visible cost etched in the closing mist. Pressure coheres under situational lens; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—honor the distilled promise—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each overwritten oath raises the cost of misreading. One tightening beat when the final line emerges; no reversals needed. Cost is conceptual (renounced fortune) yet felt in the hush after the last drip.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“why does this place endure?”—is posed on page 1 and tightens when Elias must act inside the splintering timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—renewal of hidden life—tightens via each prism adjustment; agency is steady but escalation is gentle, not urgent. Cost is present (exposure, chill, time) yet not sharply foregrounded, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—identifying Jane Doe—tightens when the ribbon narrows the timeline to one masquerade; the portrait submission forecloses anonymity and extracts a visible social cost at the memorial. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the case.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering purpose after public failure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the cloth forces Jack to choose between appraisal detachment and personal reclamation.

Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence complicates (storm) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is voiced on beat one: preserve the silenced lexicon before the second letter arrives. Cyclical reversal acts as an intensifying pressure; each propagated delay buys seconds but inches her closer to off-page doom.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Delay revelation escalates through magnetic rings narrowing Lir’s understanding; Elara’s living-experiment stake crystallizes into an earned, high-cost partial ending (no full reversal yet, so cost feels tentative).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—restore cosmic balance—tightens via accelerating drip rates that raise the cost of miscalculation. Agency is Elandor’s precise chant and micro-adjustments; the final toll forecloses the option of failure. Pressure is coherent, no coincidence resolves the crisis.

    Dominant stake—custody of the self—escalates under each causal pivot: stakes start as ownership of legacy, tighten when trial decrees vivify must happen now, finally foreclose when only merger or annihilation remain. Agency drives every turn; no luck rescue. Emotional thaw framed as irrevocable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.6)
    Competitive plagiarism is named as stakes but never faced in scene; seed's promise of innovation becomes abstract lifeline. No visible trade-off enacted. Conflict plateaus after incitement; single orthogonal leap is reported, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens through nightly iterations that visibly soften grief; the final shift is the family’s audible chuckle at dinner, a felt price paid by Elias’s continued solitude. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—free the trapped souls before the tide returns—escalates with each phase transition; options narrow as water rises. Agency is continuous: Alex swims, recites, freezes paths.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—tightens through intensifying musical pulses that disrupt the statues. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when roots tear free; cost is visible in crumbling guardians and Elara’s own fear shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mending broken promises—tightens when drone patrols intensify; Elias’s choice to uncork the storm visibly raises cost (risk of detection). One meaningful escalation suffices; no coincidence resolves the conflict. The price (continued exposure) is legible in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interpret silence as possibility rather than prison—is signaled in paragraph two and tested when the halo’s warmth pierces his muteness. Escalation is accretive: each luminous detail tightens the pressure to respond until the single decisive act of singing forecloses lifelong silence. Cost is visible: “his silence forever altered.” Coincidence (finding the grove) complicates but does not resolve; the resolution comes from Elias’s voice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—locating the birthplace of stories—intensifies via sensory density and geometric ritual, but the tightening is more atmospheric than causal; no live option is foreclosed, only a portal glimpsed.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim dream—signaled on paragraph four. Pressure tightens each time dawn advances or cipher unravels, foreclosing retreat. No secondary escalation but the single tightening is sufficient under accumulative lens. Cost: acceptance that only luminous absence is regained, not flesh. Agency is vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing Mira’s trapped idea—is signaled early and tightened when Elias must surrender the last relic. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to offer the hair, narrowing his future. Cost is visible—loss of the physical remnant and of reunion. Coincidence (star’s timing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen self—is signaled early and tightened by the “habits break” trigger. The single reversal (realizing the bargain was fair) narrows options, but the on-page cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s chance to reverse exile—tightens via tea-leaf geometry and shadow-taming test; each beat raises the price of arrogance. Final choice to confront his past is his own, with visible cost of leaving Elara behind. Escalation is causal and sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“wonder is waning”—is signaled in paragraph two and intensifies via each beat: threshold moment at the seed, trans-planar harvest, planting, visitation rush. One meaningful tightening: the act of capturing essence forecloses staying in the luminous world. Cost is felt—she loses some iridescence of her own realm—but lightly dramatized; still passes the bar.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ground the spirits—tightens with each unraveled knot; the final release forecloses Elara’s option to keep the family secret. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. The felt price is the public exposure of blood-guilt, visible in the dispersing net and settling spirits.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reopen forgotten empathies without violation—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each silent frame peels away another layer of certainty. The rhythmic “breath” in the stones tightens the mystery once, narrowing options from excavation to reverent witness. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias forecloses intrusive archaeology.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding release—is signaled early and tightens through each untangled wire; the final note forces a trade-off between knowledge and peace. Escalation is causal: each decoded layer raises the emotional cost of continued pursuit. No external reversals, but the internal deepening suffices for this length. Cost is legible in the powered-down lights and ascent without further salvage.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from code-loop—tightens once when the lightning-thunder clock forces the encode act. Agency is Elowen’s; coincidence (Lira’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is visible in the unraveling code and the thunder’s irreversible boom.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—seek joy beneath anguish—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates via diary revelations that tighten Elias’s resolve. Each floor deepens the cost of knowledge versus release. Agency culminates in the decision to preserve the diary, foreclosing the ritual path. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—coheres under growing internal fury. Escalation: each classified cloud raises the ante until the void erupts into Mira’s face, tightening options irrevocably. Cost is inscribed on Elias’s breath and the sky’s wound. One catastrophic tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—craft a sky-portrait before demolition—tightens once when fractal recursion exposes her perceptual ceiling. Escalation is density-driven: each deeper groove narrows options until the only path is acceptance. Cost is legible: the portrait remains finite, the library will fall, coin is re-sealed. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tightened when the uncapped gear forces a sync with her heartbeat, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density rather than causal reversals; the cost (frozen tears, irreversible knowledge) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—planetary collapse—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the bell demands perfect harmony. Yet escalation is driven more by lore than by character trade-offs; the felt cost is collective, not personal. Agency is diffused among the group.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver the lullaby before final ripple—tightens once when the pane yields and reseals. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible acceptance of cosmic fading. No coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save pilgrims before frost—tightens once when the nut is cracked and the wind-carved path becomes the only option. Agency is indirect but causal; the price (nut destroyed, curse still active) is legible. No escalation after the path is set, but one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—turning separation into connection—is signaled early and tightened once: the sculpture must succeed or the rift remains. Agency is Elena’s alone; coincidence never rescues. The cost is visible when she risks further rejection by sending the idea before words. One beat short of 8.8 because the external stakes (will Lila accept?) are off-stage until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender her defined life to birth new stories?—tightens quantitatively as moonlight ebbs and qualitatively when narrative fragments threaten irreversible dissolution. Only her deliberate forfeiture as vendor resolves tension, with irreparable cost embedded in the ending’s Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—self-redemption from guilt—is signaled early and tightened when the orb’s scenes lock onto his betrayal. Absorption is the decisive act that forecloses denial; tremor signals cost. Pressure is coherent but single-note; no external obstacle complicates the descent. Escalation is lyrical, not causal, yet sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—healing fractured farming communities—is signaled early and tightened when Elara tunes the tower to amplify silo “talks.” The cost is conceptual (shared vulnerability) rather than visceral, but agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—excavate and revive abandoned dreams—is signaled early and tightened through each memory modification; each act prunes a regret and forecloses the old self-definition. Agency is continuous; no external coincidence resolves anything. Cost is felt but could be sharper—loss of former stability is implied rather than dramatized in a single visceral beat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“find forgotten combinations”—is tested twice: first retreat, then successful theft under ticking hourglass of inversion. Escalation tightens when the seed cracks and tendril snaps, forcing a trade-off of safety for knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore sound—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: silence thickens until the first faint hum reweights it. Agency is Elara’s iterative strumming; cost is the emotional toll and the open-ended labor ahead. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    A single escalating gradient: the king’s reckless knight sacrifice, Elias’s exile silence, the nexus phase deadline—each compression raises the emotional price, forcing the quiet yet decisive move to press stone and seal return, not revenge.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost confessions—tightens with each frequency band; the silence of betrayal and loneliness escalate emotional cost. Agency remains Elias’s: each dial twist is a pacifist’s act of non-violent excavation. The final whisper forecloses the option of permanent estrangement, price paid in reopened grief.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turning collective fear into hopeful adaptation—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s experiment. The corpse-flower’s eruption forces a public test; the village’s decision to stay carries visible social cost. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled early and tightened by the ticking inversion hour. Mid-story, the water-flow reversal forces a micro-choice: dive against the upward current or abort. Cost is visible: time dwindles, arches begin to collapse. No external antagonist needed; environment and clock supply coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unfettering wonder—escalates via each bell strike’s intensifying aurora. One clear tightening: the cavern ice cracks under the final chord, signaling irreversible release. Cost is legible in the silence that must return, but pressure remains more textural than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—quantify emotion—tightens when each transposition forces Elias to confront the irreducibility of feeling; the final starless sky forecloses the option of complete knowledge, with the cost paid in his fragmented self.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elara seed wonder without shattering balance—tightens when Kael’s skepticism meets the pendant’s hum. One decisive intensification: the moment the pendant syncs with Kael’s pulse, time dilates and Elara’s satchel lightens. Cost is legible: relic gone, mentor fully myth. No escalation slack.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver message to lost daughter—intensifies as each weave shortens Elara’s life. One meaningful tightening: realizing the final puzzle edge will cost her existence. Cost is visible on page: “her essence fade, a latent sacrifice blooming.” No external reversals needed; internal renunciation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—revive the planet—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening descent and ritual, narrowing to the single irrevocable trade of silence. Cost is felt (Elar’s “meek silence” bartered away), but the price is abstract; a more visceral loss would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—tightens when the defector revelation forecloses the “missing brother” fantasy. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: each redirect narrows options and raises the cost of further jumps. The final cost is legible: she must now bear public shame to lift private silence. No extraneous reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: extend the chain’s safety to the haunted. Escalation is a single deepening—lamp outage intensifies the ghosts’ ache, forcing Elias’s ritual. Agency is renunciation/continuation: he gives the chain to the dead, not just the living, at visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reshaping society via recovered shadows—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as light amplifies, but the cost is conceptual (future blackout) rather than felt on-page; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why some magnetize stories—tightens when Elias must choose to follow the sun trails at potential psychic cost. The deepening is single but decisive: the orb’s reflection reweights his identity. Agency is active throughout; coincidence only complicates. The price is the inherited burden of illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the trees’ witness—tightens when Elias realizes he must deconstruct sorrow to reach it. One clear deepening: mapping grief shifts from curiosity to personal healing, with the cost of laborious precision etched in aching hands.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when “the realm’s pulse weaken[s].” Escalation is accumulative: each sung note thickens the tapestry, narrowing options to succeed or lose everything. Cost is visible exhaustion. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to transform his betrayal into usable wisdom—comes under coherent pressure as the midnight gathering forces him either to re-engage or crystallize his renunciation. The single deepening is the re-encounter with his betrayer; the man’s public remorse tightens Elias’s internal vise until his own silent forgiveness becomes the visible price that forecloses open confrontation. Pressure stays under the Accumulative/Textural lens, accruing via each paradox discussion and the ticking clock. Cost is legible in the moment he anonymously slips the note, accepting ongoing solitude as the price of that compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming apathy into awe—escalates via each guerrilla seed planted. One decisive tightening: uncloaking the mosaic forces a public reckoning with neglect. Cost is the irreversible exposure of his family’s failure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—salvage vows before oblivion—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens with each sampled frequency. Escalation is accretive: every sampled vow dims further, raising the cost of delay. The final sealing forecloses the option to save more, with trembling hands as felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—escalates through three causal feints that delay Thorne’s deal. Each false start raises the risk of exposure; the final tightening forces the merchant’s recoil and the audible fracture. Cost: Elara’s forfeited chance at direct violence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“why carry weather?”—is signaled early and tightened by each taste-shift that narrows her path to the lone carrier. The cost is the nascent storm she now harbors. Agency is present but the carrier’s explanation resolves rather than tests her further, capping the score just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim suppressed creativity—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the lock is broken, force risks loss, so art must serve as tool. The choice to rig the painting narrows options and carries the felt cost of exposing raw self-portrait to possible ruin. Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—the survival of complete candor—escalate once: water, language, and intimacy evaporate in tandem until the map locks the only living path left. The tightening is single but sufficient under accumulative pressure, though the physical risks remain more atmospheric than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the fragment arrives; one decisive intensification occurs as the sculpture’s debut rekindles awe in ascending strangers, with Elara’s muteness as visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static or lose the farm—is signaled early and tightens once when the fears leak out. The miniaturization beat narrows options; the burn escape exacts a visible price. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“unlock the mailbox to heal the neighborhood”—is clear. Pressure tightens only narratively: each story adds urgency, but no on-page obstacle or trade-off threatens failure; the key discovery is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape via encoded vulnerability—is signaled early and escalates through nightly dice rolls and dances. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final roll confirms the unlock; cost is felt as the lab’s ghosts ascend, yet the price to Elara herself remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—tightens once: the whale’s breach amplifies the gravity anomalies, making retrieval conceivable yet dangerous. The cost is felt in the final beat: he must physically enter the anomaly field, risking further loss. No reversals are needed; the single deepening suffices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—prophecy’s muting—remains intact; escalation is a single, deliberate intensification rather than cascade, fulfilling situational lens demands. A visible cost is legible but not fully scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can Elias trust the language he’s learning—tightens when he interrogates Mira under meteors. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (meteor shower) heightens atmosphere without solving the conflict. Cost is conceptual: the realization that belief, not grammar, is the true tongue. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking star-fade deadline. Agency drives escalation: Elara’s harmonic weaving is the irreversible act that forecloses retreat. Cost is palpable in the guardian’s spectral sorrow and the shell’s silence afterward. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: complete Silas’s calibrated treason without reckless haste. Escalation is one deepening: the final document’s exposure of imperial fraud is now possible, foreclosing retreat. Agency is renunciation—she releases resentment, paying with emotional cost. Pressure is coherent under causal-accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“why some echo”—is signaled early and escalates when Thorne admits guardians decide. One decisive tightening: Elara must choose to keep or free the echoes; her song costs Thorne’s power and her own certainty. Agency is hers; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—salvaging a pure fragment from betrayal—tightens when the ghosts reveal the framed cabin boy. Pressure escalates via the accumulating dream-cameos, but the decisive turn (Elara’s plan to use guided dreams) is announced rather than enacted, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—seeing hidden effort—escalates via accumulating sensory patterns until the whistle crystallizes the insight with social cost. One meaningful tightening: from private ritual to public commitment. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—truth versus sustaining hope—tightens when Elias realizes the diamond can save or doom survivors. One clear reversal: from skeptic to reluctant bearer of salvation. The cost is felt in the final beat: he shoulders the burden of dismantling comforting lies.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harnessing ancient shadows to shape a new dawn—is signaled early and escalates through each decoded fragment, tightening Elias’s variant allegiance from human causes to cosmic cycles. The cost is legible in the spider-webbed glass and the pilgrims’ arrival, but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the decisive trade-off, keeping tension just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—protect the orb—tightens when intruders breach the dock; Elias’s agency narrows to vibrational adaptation. Cost is felt: the sonic field exposes his own guilt. Pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens; no extraneous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sculpt patience from impatience—tightens when the rain awakens the viaduct, forcing the first irreversible act. Cost is legible: the wildness she leashes remains unspent, a future liability.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break ancestral control—escalates through empirical observation and timed resistance. One decisive tightening: the hum peaks, Elena maps it, then fractures it. Cost is felt in the shiver up her spine and the lantern’s flare that “shatters like breaking chains.”

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can Elias earn forgiveness and can Lena release anger—tightens once: the letter’s reading forces a joint reconfiguration. Agency is mutual; the cost is the relinquishing of old certainties. Pressure grows steadily under the Accumulative lens without forced reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and tightened once: the arrow tip’s runes must be transliterated or the yearning stays mute. Escalation is causal: each prototype iteration narrows options until only the gong remains. Cost is conceptual—the awakening of leviathans—but legible in the acid sea’s shudder. No false reversals; coincidence complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Core stake—vanished lives versus corporate erasure—is signaled early and tightened once: Elara’s lie risks her job and forces her download attempt. The cost (now she alone carries the truth) lands with felt, if modest, weight.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unity before Council verdict—tightens as each mirror glimpse converts sorrow into actionable pact. Escalation is causal: each vision mends the orb and narrows Elara’s options toward decisive descent. Cost is implicit in the “weighted breath” and orchard’s sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens when the capsized boat’s hum mirrors her own postponed death, forcing acceptance. Escalation is coherent under situational lens: environmental pressure crystallizes stance. Cost is felt in her decision to remain amid the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—whether fleeting connection can redeem mismatched lives—tightens once when Mira realizes dawn means departure. The cost is the ache of parting, legible in her whispered redefinition of destiny. Agency remains shared and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: prophet’s disruption → conjured clearings → parapet awakening → consecration. Agency lies in Elar’s ritual, which forecloses the path of letting wisdom fade. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—proving knowledge is still alive—escalates through Elias’s silent decoding sessions; each fractured echo tightens the personal risk of heresy. One decisive deepening occurs when the printer’s regretful sigh is replayed, forcing Elias to choose covert testimony over open defiance. Cost is the perpetual secrecy he embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging before forgetting—tightens through each placement of driftwood; the final convergence at the hollow forecloses alternative outcomes. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: fog thickens, markers accumulate, chalk dwindles. No external antagonist needed; the curse supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the ephemeral against collapse—is signaled early; tremors tighten options, and the leaf-fall moment forces the decisive restructuring with visible risk. Escalation is steady under Accumulative lens; cost (possible loss of dome and life’s work) remains palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (father-daughter reconciled before death) is signaled early and tightens once; hologram confrontation removes remaining option for further estrangement. The cost—death itself—pre-exists the narrative; the tightening is relational rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and escalates through each loop closure, tightening toward the final personal cost. Agency is exercised in every rune-weave; no coincidence resolves the mystery. The price (facing her own shadow) is legible but could be made more visceral on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming regret into guidance—tightens when the bone fragment becomes the literal medium for that transformation. One meaningful deepening: the tooth’s glow confirms the changeling swap, raising the cost of forgiveness. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. The price is the irreversible fusion of relics, foreclosing denial.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—signaled early; pressure tightens as each polishing stroke renounces her old blaze. One meaningful deepening: the weighing beat forces a trade-off between cosmic guilt and humble atonement. Cost is visible in her grounded stance and released pearl.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming private pain into shared meaning—tightens once when Elara decides to proffer the pendant. Pressure accumulates through the garden’s enveloping quiet and the stranger’s mirrored wounds; the cost is the pendant itself. No external reversals, but the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—the pressure of being sucked toward obliteration within the “whisper of closing pages”—escalates once per collection beat: each hope stolen tightens the nexus’s current. The final reversal in pressure is Elias’s own agency: crushing the anchor propels him against the drag he previously bent to. Cost accrues on-page as the shell’s fragments bite flesh and choices narrow to renunciation or dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the arbor—tightens through each sung story; the blight’s retreat is the earned escalation. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence does not intrude. The cost is the moon’s surrender and the tendril’s release, but the pressure could sharpen one notch earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate love’s rhythm into a path—tightens once: the eclipse window forces the irreversible sealing. Cost is visible (frozen tears, spent starlight). Agency drives the escalation; coincidence only frames, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against future bleakness—tightens once: Elias’s daily return to the cavern deepens the pattern until the timer’s restoration forecloses the option of loss. Cost is visible in the frost-rimmed entrance and the spent weeks.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape from infinite recursion—is signaled early and escalates through each calcification. Each new stone narrows options until the meta-pattern forces the final self-weave. Cost is cumulative: every burden taken on tightens her own trap before it finally breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—containing impermanence through carving—tightens once: the first cut commits her to shaping loss. Pressure is coherent but singular; no second reversal or felt price beyond the quiet act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—renegotiating her eroded self—tightens as each fragment forecloses denial. The ghost’s demand escalates pressure; Elara’s counter-offer (“rebuild from the silt”) is a visible trade-off. Cost is legible in the ghost’s fading form and the carousel’s ominous creak.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (saving the building and its promise) intensifies as each burst pipe shrinks viable options; water’s gradual redirection is one clear rise of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Regret intensifies from distant ache to pressing weight, then pivots to excruciatingly gentle release that narrows options to renunciation. No external antagonist, yet the pressure tightens believably under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus consolatory myth—is articulated early and tested by physical act (salvage) and final revelation (the scrolls themselves are lies). A single but meaningful deepening occurs when discovering the forgeries, narrowing choices to keep or discard; the keep decision reweights the entire quest. Visible cost: forfeiture of heroic ending, acceptance of lifelong sceptic’s burden. Coincidence (the chest happens to glide under his keel) is allowed to complicate, not solve, hence no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preservation of ancient seed wisdom—is signaled early and tightened once: decoding the rope yields the weaver’s method, foreclosing ignorance. Escalation is accretive (fog thickens, cold deepens, knots reveal symbols) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lens. Cost is embodied in sustained stillness and relinquished fulgurite.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Elias must “explain” Mira’s absence while acknowledging his own solitude. Rising pressure comes from intensifying sensory elegy, not a narrowing set of options. Tension grows texture-ally rather than causally, consistent with Accumulative lens. Closure does not trade off life-options; it crystallizes acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—revive beauty or accept its loss—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened through each assembly beat. Escalation is accumulative: each hypothesis raises the cost of failure, the palace’s quakes intensify, the egg’s glow reveals corruption. The final tightening—activate despite flaws—forecloses purity forever. Cost is legible in the metallic feathers and Elandor’s weeping.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens when the grafted sapling vibrates with melody; the cost is Elara’s public exposure of her lineage to the nomads. Pressure grows accumulatively: each evening watering with brine deepens commitment. No external antagonist needed; internal stakes escalate through ritual repetition. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“liberate trapped memories”—tightens when each breadcrumb confirms the path; the unsealing forces a trade-off (glow spent, skepticism softened). Escalation is steady, not steep, but cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—breaking the generational wilt—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the gear’s simulation reveals “infinite stagnation.” The cost is felt in Elowen’s haunted memory of fiery ancestors, but the on-page price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s living shape—tightens as each circuit of ribbon and butterfly swarm intensifies the pattern; the final carving renounces inscription for abstraction, foreclosing the old method. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance through personal absolution—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias realizes the bob’s pause equals the village’s fracture. The decisive act (transferring inscriptions) narrows options: secrecy is foreclosed, guilt is externalized. Cost is visible—the handle’s faded carvings mark forfeiture—though the escalation is single-note, not multi-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering buried intentions—tightens once when the tapestry map points to the unmarked grave; agency is Elias’s methodical untangling that forecloses mystery. Pressure escalates via spectral voices rising in volume, a clear Accumulative intensification. Cost is vicarious (lovers’ regret) more than personal, keeping it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving stories under surveillance—tightens once: the risk of detection forces the cloaking tactic, narrowing options. Cost is visible in Elias’s nightly vigil and the final spent stillness. Escalation is single-arc but sufficient for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“trap the ephemeral”—is signaled early, then deepened as the portrait crystallizes but must crack, sharpening cost under the Accumulative lens. One tightening: powdering the sketch commits Elias to a path he can’t undo. Missing is an on-stage obstacle that actively narrows options mid-scene; pressure derives mostly from inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned myth—is signaled early and tightens through each sifted layer. The cog’s discovery forces a decisive intellectual stance; however, the price (perpetual outsiderhood) is implied more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Escalation tracks cleanly: grudges → muted overtones → elder’s voice joining; the felt price is diffuse—social credit rather than visceral, limiting upper-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    A single dominant stake—memory reclamation versus enforced amnesia—tightens once, crystallized when Elias chooses to prune himself first. The celestial alignment intensifies pressure; cost is felt both physically (re-experiencing loss) and socially (sanctuary now vulnerable). Agency is clear, luck only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore power—tightens once when Elara deciphers the riddle and again when she opens the box. Agency is hers, but the cost (risk of permanent wonder loss) is more asserted than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understand the houses before wonder fades—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each displaced object tightens the pattern until the ritual reconfigures meaning. Agency is Elias’s deliberate gathering and arranging; the cost is the silence he now inhabits. No reversals, but the deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to welcome nuance into certainty—is signaled early and tightened through each revelation. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to insert ampoule despite risk. Cost is visceral—tears, regulator hiss, internal collapse of grudge. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rupturing perpetual motion to seize regret’s texture—is signaled early and escalates via each theorem. One decisive tightening: the proof’s completion triggers the tremor. Cost is felt in Elias’s lingering doubt. Could be sharper if the rupture exacted a physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving forgotten kindness—tightens once when Elias commits to anonymous distribution; the cost is conceptual (sleepless labor, distilled moonlight) but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival—tightens as supplies dwindle and the spring freezes. One decisive intensification: baking as thermal and symbolic engine. Cost is the communal exposure of names and fading skills; no coincidence resolves the thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—undo the shipwreck—is signaled early and tightened by each reverse-tick of the clocks. The final activation forecloses retreat: the beam reverses, tide pauses, and Elias pays with existential uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into exposing its weakness—is signaled early and tightened through each paradoxical confession. One meaningful turn: exposure starves fear. Cost is the unbearable self-revelation in the cursed photo. Agency remains Elias’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—orchard’s survival against leeward tide—signaled early. Escalation via tide’s approach tightens options; prophet’s agency drives the turn from threat to symphony. Cost is the abstract surrender of control to harmony, legible in final image. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover fate of lost expedition—tightens once via the spiral revelation that forces the taboo crack. Escalation is causal: each decoded ring narrows options until only sacrilege remains. Cost is visceral—the thunder-crack echo and the irreversible breach of sacred shell. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rescue truth from noble lies—is signaled early and tightens once: the letter’s myth must be reframed, not destroyed. The cost is conceptual (truth remains sealed) but felt through Elias’s resolute departure; one meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving abandoned dreams against erasure—tightens when Elias chooses to bury the locket rather than keep it. The single deepening (loose flagstone → hidden compartment → irreversible sealing) narrows options under coherent pressure; the cost is the forfeiture of personal keepsake and future access.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover honest lineage—tightens once the blackout traps her. Agency is steady: hypothesis formed, vault breached, ledger stamped. Pressure deepens but never spikes; the seismic tremor complicates rather than endangers. Cost is intellectual redefinition, not tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief into cranes—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: polishing the gem forces Elias to relive Mira’s dreams, narrowing options to release or drown in memory. Cost is felt in the “luminous torment” and the shadow left behind. Escalation is single but sufficient for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—locate and perhaps redeem the lost potential—is signaled early and tightens with each perturbation. The final narrowing to the “vast reservoir over his homeland” forces a trade-off: touch the pool or let it drift. Cost is visible in the shuddering observatory and the trembling reach; escalation is coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and escalates as each shard narrows the gap. Cost is implied (time, risk of void travel) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—manufactured vs. real identity—escalates through progressive narrowing: from forged heroes to ignoble grandfather, to holding physical trace of cowardice. Each excavation of carving tightens possibilities rather than repeating; fabrication spirals into confession, not reset. Closure remains earned by Elias’s own sift and weigh, not external deliverance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—redemption via flawless exchange—tightens as moon phase narrows the window. One meaningful escalation: ropes fall, prisoners cross, delegations retreat, leaving Elias in charged poise. Cost is felt in the hush that follows; no luck resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—align heart and action—is signaled early and tightened when each pole becomes a counted regret. Agency drives escalation: every step inland narrows future options. Cost is visible in the final image (“weight lifting”). No external antagonist, but internal conflict suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover empathy or stay hollow—is signaled early and tightened at each fork. The right-path choice narrows future options and carries immediate atmospheric cost (darker, wetter, more claustrophobic). Agency drives escalation; coincidence merely complicates. One more beat of tangible loss (e.g., physical injury) would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates as the cost of metamorphosis intensifies; the uncertain “becoming beast-like” forecloses human identity and drives the decisive choice to merge essences.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—open the locked dimension—escalates via each photograph’s shimmer; each stitch forecloses the option of violence and deepens the cost of pacifist commitment. One clear tightening beat per photograph suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s last act of giving—tightens when the detour forces him to spend his treasure to save Mira; the cost is the emptied satchel and the new identity of inadvertent prophet. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—unseating the council via cradle—escalates with each blackout minute; Elara’s agency steers every forward beat, no coincidence resolves stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understand vs flee—is signaled early and tightens when precog vision presents “cost of elusiveness.” One meaningful intensification: placing the eighth Fibonacci rock ignites star dust, forcing the irreversible trade-off. No extraneous reversals; coincidence appears only as complicating wash-up, never as resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turning censored rage into transmissible truth—tightens through escalating storm and poetic distillation. One meaningful deepening: the mentor’s scar-map forces Elias to trade raw anger for luminous precision. Cost is felt in the final envelope’s clandestine route. Agency remains causal under Accumulative lens; no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—trade philosophical riddle for real maps—escalates when rivals duel over the object; presence ensures a felt cost: map parchments are exchanged for the artifact, narrowing Elias’s next path.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—tightens when Elias renounces passive wandering to plant rebellion; the cost is Jax’s death and the risk of execution, visible in the seed-scattering act that forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rewrite fate’s ending—signals early and tightens once: the compasses stabilize only after Elias risks irreversible exile from the filmic Lila. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The felt cost (leaving Lila again) is legible yet briefly stated, capping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Primary stake clearly declared: revive collective memory before rains erase the ridge. Progression steadily narrows—seed planted → dream decoded → voice commanded awakening—until only interpretation remains viable. The monsoon clock tightens options, and the visible price is the acceleration of the sprout rendering the ridge fragile. No reversals, but coherent pressure forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—tightens once via the lace-guided ritual; the cost is the felt relinquishing of drowning sorrow. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but no secondary loss (tool, stamina) alters later tactics.


== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B 25-07 Think ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through dust's accumulation: initial observation becomes fractal decay that softens orchid stems and splinters trellis, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is visible in "orchids' stems softened" and her altered actions, though escalation lacks one more intensification beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten via frost-ledge alignment, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—environment reveals path rather than Elara’s choices narrowing options; dominant "purpose in pauses" stake deepens but cost isn’t physically charged in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: emotional heat-mapping narrows options from personal grief to collective hope; cost legible in "tears" as silence transforms, though external pressure lacks physical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (laying spirits to rest) tightens meaningfully when a spirit "resisting, pulling him into a whirlpool," forcing higher-risk void occupation. Cost (physical/emotional toll) legible in Elias’ exhaustion, but escalation lacks sufficient narrowing of options—resolution relies slightly on lens mending rather than earned tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (unity vs. sanctions) tightens through Elias's declaration, but escalation lacks agency—youth unrest remains off-page murmur, not direct pressure forcing his choice; cost is felt (endured sanctions) but not actively earned through prior trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding unused love) signaled early but pressure remains passive; sparks appear via ritual rather than earned struggle. Cost (emptied vial) legible but lacks trade-off—no visible price paid during escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through accumulating visions (fading lovers' initials, prehistoric blooms disintegrating), but Elias's agency in resolution lacks sufficient complication—the halo fragment's origin remains purely external without deepening moral calculus. Cost (irretrievable echoes) is legible yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten credibly as invaders breach the perimeter, forcing Elias's final key sequence under pressure; cost (continued captivity) is felt but slightly undersold against the monumental seed-vault victory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Elias' agency as he collects layered absences ("a branch without its blossom"), but the resolution's emotional release feels slightly unearned—the "impact of memories" doesn't sufficiently complicate his final action beyond passive reception.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative lens via moonbeam reinterpretation, but the protagonist’s agency falters—the magical revelation drives the climax, not her choices, diluting the visible cost of abandoning thievery despite resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Elias' agency: rising water narrows options to "finish or drown," culminating in the felt cost of abandoning the control room. One tightening suffices, but "relentless melting" could heighten urgency earlier to maximize pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten causally under pressure: Mara's approach forces decoding race, with Elias's phobias creating authentic trade-offs; cost legible in trembling hands and harnessed-but-raw fears during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (map before oblivion) signaled early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully; storm rattles fort yet fails to narrow options or alter tactics. No escalation beyond atmospheric dread, missing the 8.0+ requirement of foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (origin of thoughts) intensifies through violin-playing as timelines amalgamate, narrowing options from fragmented loops to unified awareness. Agency in Eko’s choice to play carries conceptual cost (thawing courtyard), but escalation leans too internal—environmental pressure (frozen setting) doesn’t sufficiently compound the stakes during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through Elias' agency as he decodes each ticket, but the doodles' confession method resolves the mistrust conflict it didn't create, risking coincidence-as-solution under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: frost deadline forces escalation from nightly mending to public revelation. Cost is visible in Thorne's collapse and villagers' confusion, though secondary pressure from Thorne could deepen earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (proving sideways time) tightens via temporal eddy threat, but escalation relies on coincidence (nexus flare) rather than protagonist agency. Cost (near-erasure) feels visceral yet lacks integration with Elara's personal stakes beyond professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (decoding ghost's message) tightens through water damage revealing images, but escalation leans on atmospheric coincidence rather than protagonist agency. Cost (transformation) is visible but not deeply felt under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's agency in smudging, but escalation lacks contested struggle—no moment where she nearly abandons the margins method, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (truth's weight) tightens meaningfully when ghosts appear, but radio calls force thematic mirroring rather than Alex's agency driving escalation; cost (burden release) is felt but not visibly paid until the very end, slightly delaying legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain abstract ("witness change") with no concrete pressure testing commitment; keeper faces zero opposition or trade-offs during observations. Escalation lacks deepening—seasons drift without altering tactics—rendering "burrowing deeper" a hollow intensifier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via eclipse's cadence shift, but Finn's apathy-to-wonder arc lacks visible price paid; the cost (renewed vulnerability) feels conceptual rather than dramatized in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (restoring dreams) signaled early, but pressure remains static—no escalation beyond discovery; Elias faces no opposition, reducing tension to passive revelation rather than earned agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (transforming secrets) tightens via microdot deployment, but the "grand" cookie placement lacks escalation—Elias faces no opposition, muting the cost of his orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through deepening rhetorical density ("Why do we assume, assume, assume?") with tangible cost (tendrils grazing robe), but the live clock ("unseen hour") remains vague, missing a chance to tighten tactics under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten via Elias's agency: exhaustion narrows his window to map memories before dawn, with the cost (drained strength) altering his final conduct; dominant stake crystallizes early but could escalate sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via Elias’s agency: adjusting phonograph to "layer another backward song" deepens the hush that cracks Mira’s numbness. Cost is visceral ("tears tracing her cheeks without a sob") and scales perfectly to length. One decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (vanilla/rain → jasmine/earth → illness memories) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to confront grief. Cost is unmistakable in his sobs, though technicians' unexplained exit slightly undermines pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen via Elias’ agency: patterning the rope tightens the "impossible choice" into tangible tradeoffs (humanity vs. knowledge). Cost is felt in "forever chasing," but the core dilemma isn’t dramatized until the climax, slightly weakening early pressure coherence under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: the bowl's humming escalates to "fracturing thin ice" as protagonist's acoustic perception drives the unbinding choice. Conceptual cost of embracing incompletion reweights the chronic hush irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through one deepening: erratic sparks pulled into core fuse insight/empathy, narrowing options to transformation. Cost is visible in physical metamorphosis ("flesh to ethereal"), but escalation lacks a distinct micro-turn to push beyond 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully around Elias' hesitation to intervene, with visible cost in his vulnerable backstory sharing; however, conflict remains low-pressure under accumulative lens, missing escalating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract; no narrowing of options despite "perilous edges." Community hesitation resolves via reed talismans without trade-offs, violating escalation requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: dissonant notes narrow options by intensifying cadence pressure. Dominant stake (preserving nap) signaled early via elders' warnings, with tangible cost in borrowed time visibly altering tactics (sculpting key). No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elias' agency: tracing patterns narrows options from "questions with no edges" to ambiguous possibility. Cost is legible in the emotional shift from "aching loss" to "quiet hope" with conceptual price of accepting uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single stake (visibility vs seclusion) tightens through Elias's agency in approaching woman, but memory-triggered escalation leans slightly passive; cost legible via conceptual shift in final visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through single deepening where struggle fuels transformation, making surrender necessary; cost legible in irreversible physical change, though escalation leans slightly passive as storm acts upon her.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (threshing meaning) tightens through artifact convergence, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—rain trails and Mira's arrival rely on coincidence. Cost (brooch exchange) visible, yet pressure grows texturally rather than through Elias's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation via sensory density (unpredictable melodies, overlapping shadows) reweights the "magnify everyday magic" stake effectively, but the cost of lost foresight lacks visceral immediacy during the inhabitation climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's staggered revelations as pressure tightens; each interval narrows emotional options ("allowing reflection without overwhelm"), but the cost of exile remains abstractly felt rather than viscerally demonstrated in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (punching confession ticket), but "bad habits dissolving" resolution lacks visible cost—escalation driven by lens-consistent accumulation, yet cost proof test fails for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via sensory density (whale calls intensifying, tile patterns emerging) perfectly reweights the dominant stake under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility suffers—permanent loss is felt yet lacks unmistakable on-page manifestation in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate texturally via solar storm’s intensifying pressure, but agency feels passive—"this was her chance" frames opportunity as coincidence. Cost (shattered amulet) lacks tangible impact on enduring immortality, weakening trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: "active waiting" deepens into algorithm decoding that narrows options to midnight's vulnerability window. Cost is legible in "alerts would come" yet "scales finally even" crystallizes conceptual trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake escalation via Elias' agency: staccato hum directly triggers warning realization, narrowing options to "collect more" with visible cost (solitude transformed into burden); single tightening sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming erased identity) deepens through fragment accumulation, but protagonist agency lacks visible trade-offs; tidal framework provides rhythm without tightening tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (decoding transience) tightens via the seashell's fading paint, but Elias's agency in escalation feels passive; the cello method emerges without sufficient prior causal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens as corporate scouts arrive during masquerade ball, forcing stance crystallization. Lanara's agency drives escalation—her encoded graffiti method shifts from covert signals to the mural's reorganization plan. Cost is felt in her emotional arc, though the crowd's intuitive gathering slightly softens the resolution's friction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (preserving fading hush) signaled early; escalation via timed messages deepens resolve under Accumulative lens. But "outlast" action lacks protagonist-driven agency—the pre-programmed chemicals drive escalation, not Elena's choices. Cost legible but not earned through her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s auditory mapping under time pressure, but the "anchor lifts at dawn" clock lacks tangible mid-scene tradeoffs; cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency—falcon coordinates tighten options, phrasebook rehearsal deepens knowledge—culminating in legible cost as "worrying tranquility" becomes physical peril on the ice, though internal/external conflict interweaving feels slightly underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signaled early ("before the collapse"), with escalation via townspeople joining the rhythm, but the central threat lacks tangible consequence—tremors ease without showing what failure would cost. Agency drives deepening, yet cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via oxygen countdown forcing agency: survival versus harnessing transience. Escalation driven by Elara’s choices (uncorking vial, unsnarling hush) under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral—final warnings blare as she seals victory. Single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake ("before bodies found") tightens options but remains abstract; no visible trade-off when Elias chooses confession. Agency evident but cost feels conceptual rather than tactical (e.g., no lost opportunity).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes signaled early ("debt calls me back"), pressure tightens via escalating visits sapping Elias’s strength under Accumulative lens. Agency is reactive (channeling resonance), not proactive, limiting escalation depth. Cost ("venom seeping into veins") is felt but lacks visible tradeoffs in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (transforming ruins into reverence) tightens through each sleepwalking encounter: chasm bridge mends isolation, orchid garden defies barrenness, altar tapestry achieves rebirth. Cost is legible in tangible landscape changes, with agency shown through Elara's persistent action despite amnesiac state.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (faith restoration) tightens through discoveries, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven resistance; gnomon find feels fortuitous not earned through struggle against orchard’s peril.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (unraveling conspiracies) tightens via synchronization beats, but escalation lacks causal pressure—revelations accumulate without narrowing Elara’s options or altering tactics with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (reclaiming unsaid apologies) tighten through Elara’s agency—tracing messages narrows options from reflection to action—but the cost ("mending fractures of regret") feels emotionally resolved too neatly, slightly dulling the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (fear of unhealed wounds) tightens via decryption deepening—Amir’s cast smudges transform into sister’s poem. Cost legible in "emotional knots still tight" and final "seeds in fertile dusk." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming joy) faces no concrete pressure—knowledge network resolves instantly with no resistance; escalation lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs; "faint spark" never truly conflicts with melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake clear but pressure fails to intensify—awakenings feel identical without narrowing options. Missing required meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation relies on magical revelation rather than character agency; Thorne's change stems from symphony-induced visions, not his own choices under pressure.

    Stakes signaled early (mining vs. sanctity), but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening. Chain discovery resolves conflict coincidentally; no visible price paid for harmonization beyond abstract "dappled resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (trust vs isolation) escalate credibly through Aria's training, but pigeon's return with reconciliation borders on coincidence resolving conflict rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, diluting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via conjecture-driven deepening: "farewell's echo" seed to sailor's voyage, narrowing options to acceptance of natural drift; cost ("gentle ache") unmistakable in closure image. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes ("serenade monotony") remain abstract; Mira’s instant wonder lacks struggle or cost. Pressure tightens via Elias’s setup, but no trade-off—e.g., wind scattering flyers resolves cleanly without consequence, failing to reweight options under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)

    Dominant stake (preserving mundane beauty vs industrial erasure) tightens via dawn timeframe; single deepening (ripple observation yielding insight) suffices, with conceptual cost legible in "true pearls of the bay" realization—Elias' agency in ritual forecloses denial path.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signaled early but escalation passive—Elara follows ritual rather than driving agency under pressure. "Operatively gentle" trait lacks visible tradeoffs; redemption price felt but not actively chosen during muster, capping escalation depth.

    Dominant stake (unraveling destiny's mechanism) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; storm intensifies atmosphere yet doesn't force tactical adaptation (e.g., no struggle reading scroll amid shaking structure), leaving cost felt rather than visibly altering choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through ritual escalation: tile's hum → portal → sages' judgment, all driven by Elias' agency. Cost is unmistakable in "thrifty heart racing" and eternal covenant weight. Dominant stake ("seal covenant with unknown") crystallizes through frugality-as-devotion tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through Elias' inquiries narrowing options (rewriting fates vs. timeline unraveling), driven by agency under the Accumulative lens.

    Escalation via Accumulative lens: fables' density intensifies into "palpable confusion" threatening overwhelm, narrowing Elara's options to merging the rope.

    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each silence collection deepens the dominant stake (claustrophobia vs. expansive peace) with visible cost in waning inversion time. "Trembling hands" at nexus crystallizes irreversible commitment with felt opportunity cost.

    Dominant stake (mathematics of mercy) escalates through trauma responses, yet resolution requires no meaningful trade-off—she computes forgiveness without enduring loss. The "warm calculus" soothes pain rather than charging it, violating band guardrail requiring visible price for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)

    Escalation driven by agency (tracing stars) under Accumulative lens with felt cost ("layer of exhaustion peeled away"). Meteor shower deepening reweights stakes, but "unwritten calendar" doesn't concretely alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes ("nurture faint glimmers") signaled early and deepen texturally, but conflict lacks teeth—raiders mentioned but absent, no tangible opposition testing commitment. Cost is legible ("endless vigils"), yet pressure isn't concretely tested beyond the charm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elias's agency—seeking groves, using the gear with each wind type—narrowing options until the symphony unlocks the frontier. Cost is unmistakable: the gear's silence signifies internal shift, altering his translocation purpose with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's indirect route traversal, but pressure lacks visible price: the "leash of doubt" breaks instantly without struggle, and ferry guides resolve obstacles without cost, leaving agency untested under true duress.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (safety’s cost) tightens via Elias’s agency: curiosity about discoloration triggers memory flood, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral—choosing fortress silence as active confrontation, not fear—with the bolt’s warmth crystallizing the trade-off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (unmasking Vesper) are clear but pressure doesn’t escalate meaningfully—Vesper’s "unease" grows passively via rune mechanics, not Elowen’s choices. Climax resolves through magical sundering rather than earned agency, though cost (Vesper’s dissolution) is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she decodes the atlas via rhythmic tapping, with the "periodically eternal" attribute enabling the method; cost crystallizes in her father's complicity, though revelation timing slightly over-optimizes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes (reigniting rebellion) signaled early but pressure grows through atmosphere, not protagonist agency. Stone circle activation feels coincidental; no trade-off or visible price paid despite thematic "cost."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake "will trauma consume him?" tightens through somatic freeze to pearl-plucking; cost is ongoing grief (photo burns) but visible shift to grounded optimism; agency drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten causally as walls compress air and time fractures, forcing descent into darkness. Elias’s redesign action forecloses despair with visible cost (enduring luminescent ache), and "necessary darkness" motivation creates authentic tension between safety and rebirth without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through ink-fade urgency, but escalation lacks visible price—saboteur threat vanishes after setup, leaving "calm rage" unresolved as conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate causally: letter discovery → moral dilemma → network activation → transmission. Pressure tightens via protagonist's agency (scanning letter) with visible cost (permanent societal rupture). "Dizzying quiet" intensifies stakes but "within the blink" timeframe lacks live-clock tension—surprise-to-action feels instantaneous without tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative lens, yet escalation lacks visceral cost—father's absence remains backstory, not present forfeiture. "Weaving continuity" motivation tightens but pays no tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Eron's agency: his silence-driven method intensifies pressure until the constellation alignment creates opportunity. The cost—renouncing possession for "fleeting communion"—is legible in the release moment. Minor deduction as the timeframe's "patterns break" concept slightly abstracts the pressure despite textual integration.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s proof-by-contradiction method, narrowing options from passive observation to active invitation. Agency drives escalation as her ledger discovery reframes the sabotage accusation, with cost legible in her father’s isolation. Single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake ("hush dissonance of guilt") signaled early, with cry translation deepening knowledge. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara follows the scientist’s method rather than making trade-offs. Single meaningful deepening suffices for length, yet cost feels intellectualized over visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through mandala’s escalating density, narrowing options from isolated whispers to collective sand-sifting. Cost is visceral in "lilac unease softening" but lacks tangible trade-off; protagonist agency drives the interjection yet external pressure (grotto’s echoes) dominates escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (despair vs. hope) deepen through echoes, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara’s passive reception of Silas’s magic forecloses no path with felt cost; the "tightening" reveals rather than tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (bridging communication gaps) signaled via radio news. Pressure tightens through somatic navigation of telepathy glitches, narrowing options to mutual vulnerability. Cost is visceral (spine chill, shoulder tension) and shapes tactics—Alex’s agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation deepens through protagonist agency: activating the scanner triggers the fossil's float, narrowing options from documentation to pursuit. Cost is legible in "steps light in altered gravity"—a tangible physical/metaphorical weightlessness that forecloses passive observation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (fixing network) lacks escalation—no moment where prudence nearly fails them; "prudently daring" remains thematic label without tradeoff cost (e.g., caution delaying encoding under time pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten credibly via the rain’s cadence—"gutters’ ticking slowing to sporadic drips" narrows Elias’ window. Agency-driven deepening (distilling layers) reconfigures knowledge, but cost feels slightly underweighted until the calm settles as visible relief.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative/Textural lens as fractured timelines deepen Elias' understanding, but the cost of "resistance born of care" remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid; smoke flattening tightens time pressure without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: rose's death triggers ritual, "quivering hush" deepens pressure during adjustments, and vulnerability cost is felt on water; but predators remain abstract, reducing visceral escalation impact despite solid causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through sensory escalation (hum vibrating bones, memories "cracking open"), with protagonist agency driving the deepening—yet the single pressure point lacks a visceral, felt price beyond metaphorical "fracturing" at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (emotional isolation) tightens through Elias’s agency in creating the installation; cost is visceral when he shares his own words, though the pressure arc lacks one tangible complication before Mira’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate causally: tricksters' "vector" targets tonight's protest → Elara's interference directly narrows options to disrupt violence. Cost ("scars of division") is legible in the final beat, though secondary emotional toll remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency (pressing compass) deepens claustrophobia vs. freedom stakes through spatial mutiny's physical manifestation. Cost is unmistakable in "wistful sorrow," though fallow period's atmospheric role limits tactical tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (solving cold case while confronting empathy) tightens via Elias’s research-to-portrait escalation under Accumulative lens; cost of emotional vulnerability is visible in memorial scene, but "lancing core" resolution feels slightly convenient without prior tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reversing exile) tightens through journal decoding, but decoding succeeds too easily without earned reversal. Cost remains conceptual (doubt) rather than felt consequence; station endangerment mentioned but not dramatized as tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through scaffold-wrap intensification under Accumulative lens, but Elias's agency is passive—pressure resolves via environmental coincidence rather than his decisions altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (keeping sanctuary) tighten via Victor's arrival, but confrontation lacks visceral pressure escalation; agency clear in dissuasion method yet cost remains conceptual rather than tactile, weakening peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Thorne's telegram ("Burden too heavy alone"), narrowing Elara's options to shared decoding. Cost is visceral: his "fractured" voice and years of solitary struggle directly alter her tactics, driving agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Elowen's agency through expanding circles narrows options relentlessly; cost is unmistakable when her rigid guardedness unbends amid the ritual's "warlike calm."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through scar-linking escalation under Accumulative lens, but "cost" of unbinding roots lacks visceral immediacy until final beats, slightly delaying cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation of sensory pressure (dust, echoes, fabric texture), but the cloth's discovery relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency, limiting escalation depth despite strong cost legibility in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through deepening: "liminal hush" pressure crystallizes agency as Elias maps analogies, culminating in the irreversible planting. Cost is visceral—grief transmuted but enduring—proving "visible price that charges the final image" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) is clear early, but pressure remains static—the identities’ "chaotic protest" resolves too easily via monologue without protagonist-driven deepening. Cost is conceptual ("spark lost") but not viscerally dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (reciting confessions), narrowing options from inspection to ritual participation; cost is legible via physical warmth and memory flood, but the "heartbeat of hesitation" repetition slightly dilutes the escalation’s uniqueness under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Accumulative pressure: each sensory layer (rain, graffiti phrases) deepens emotional stakes until cross-referencing maps triggers the insight. Cost is unmistakable in "weight of guilt begin to lift," but the escalation relies solely on internal realization without external consequence, slightly muting the felt price for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through propagation delays' tangible effects (ink blooming, reversed phrases), but cyclical reversal threat lacks visceral testing—Elara's caution feels intellectual rather than pressured by imminent personal cost in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation driven by textural deepening (fern whispers intensifying, amulet dimming) under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual ("mulberry ache softening") without visible sacrifice altering tactics. Empire/dream stakes dramatized yet resolution avoids concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten as Thorne’s breath fades, narrowing options to the emerald infusion; cost is visceral in Elara’s "quiet triumph" undercut by her mortality awareness ("how many more could she save?"), fulfilling Accumulative escalation through density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (contentment's source) tightens via ritual escalation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven agency; Lir's erratic aura complicates yet resolution stems from Elara's pre-established realization rather than in-scene adaptation. Cost felt yet not visibly paid by Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single tightening (chime interpretation urging "unhook") narrows options under textural lens, but Mara's stakes remain abstract—"shatter family illusions" lacks visceral cost like lost trust or exile, weakening escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation through Lir's frustration ("Why do you hold back?") narrowing options to forced revelation is driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens, with unmistakable cost in Lir's prior ignorance transforming into earned patience.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through stillness-as-agency: physical pursuit impossibility forces perceptual navigation. Cost legible in "centuries of layered dust" shifting as testament to patience paid for clarity. Pulse's erratic throbs escalate pressure texturally.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes crystallize through protagonist agency: unstrapping the keystone narrows options (release luminance or not), with unmistakable cost in emotional vulnerability ("wept for pure joy"). Pressure tightens via Accumulative density toward the chamber's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency (swimming, deliberate search) under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens as lantern glow activates the tag. Cost is unmistakable: his perception is forever altered, crystallized when "truth no longer hiding, but illuminating his world" after the tag's hum rewires reality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (rebirth vs. eternal night) tighten through Elara's agency in distilling static bursts. Escalation via deepening knowledge ("purpose woven into cycle") reweights options, but cost—transformed doubt—feels slightly abstract despite observatory's tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (naming fears to honor loss) tighten through light-intensification, narrowing options to ritual completion. Agency-driven escalation; cost is visceral in "heartbreak eased fractionally." Lacks one micro-choice showing sacrifice during naming (e.g., hesitation over "Void's Whisper").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dripping rates escalation (1→7 per breath) drives protagonist agency under accumulative lens, narrowing options through precise tempo; cost legible in "sweat beaded" and "fragility" but lacks specific sacrifice (e.g., magic depletion).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake (memory isolation vs. shared legacy) tightens via photo trail’s escalating personal cost. Agency-driven escalation peaks at church bell tower, where confronting father’s photo compels action. Cost—unearthing grief—is unmistakable in "memories flooded back, unbidden and sharp."

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (harmonizing logic/intuition) tightens through starling pattern interpretation forcing intuitive leap; cost legible in tear, though "before final transformation" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure to narrow options earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency—radio's updraft report forces vine-harness revision—yet "invisible weight" cost remains conceptual rather than physically dramatized in the evacuation's success.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Kai's agency in rejecting domination for unity, with cost legible in merged identity. History rewrites force stance crystallization without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (safeguarding business) tightens through Elias' realization, but competitors remain abstract threats; cost is conceptual (risking on untested idea) rather than viscerally felt, missing Band 8.8+ escalation requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative escalation via nightly repetitions deepens grief’s "rigid edges" until cracks form. Protagonist agency (pulling cord) forecloses escape, with eternal haunting as visceral cost—"Elias remained" reweights options under undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes remain abstract ("Would the rift reopen?") without concrete escalation; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks visible cost paid *during* the scene. Waiting deepens stance but doesn't narrow options per accumulative lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through Elias' agency—each shattering narrows options toward the curse-as-illusion realization; cost is felt in "liberated souls" fragments but could heighten emotional tradeoffs during third approximation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (finding renewal in endings) tighten through Elara's agency—discarding assumptions narrows her interpretive options. The perigee's time pressure forces decisive tuning, with cost legible in the waning moon. Escalation is driven by her method, but the singular stake lacks competing goods; the "cost" feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate via Elias' radio/hourglass actions under Situational lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss alters tactics despite dominant "vanishing" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (finding connection's texture) tightens through weaving density increases, with agency-driven escalation (each "memories alter" deepens illusion). Cost legible in spent thread and emotional shift to acceptance. "Cracks appeared" escalation slightly abrupt but sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (mastering starlight navigation) tightens via one deepening beat: simulation success reveals emotional cost ("beauty born of loss"). Agency clear but pressure lacks escalation—Elias faces no tangible opposition beyond meticulous calibration, weakening the tightening required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes deepen texturally ("reeling hush" intensifying) but lack visible cost scaling—Elara's abandonment of her personal quest isn't dramatized as a trade-off, leaving escalation feeling observational rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.5)
    One dominant stake (free souls before tide shifts) escalates causally: liquid→vapor→solid phases narrow options while raising physical cost (cold breath, steam-choked panic). The receding tide’s "tremble" makes the cost undeniable as Alex conquers phobia.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Alex’s agency: heartbeat panic → ink ritual → defragmentation. Cost is visceral in his slowed count and "tender lessons" realization. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via patterned density (static → glitches → coherent voice), though Elara’s wisdom risks slight abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (language preservation) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Birds' pattern resolves the method coincidentally rather than through earned adaptation, and residual energy cost isn't forged through struggle. Agency remains observational until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes tighten via arrowhead's escalating gravity (soil particles orbiting), narrowing options to metamorphosis; but "cosmic joke" motivation lacks tangible trade-offs during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via density increase (music swelling to "velvet thunder") reweights stake under Accumulative lens, but narrowing of options feels implied rather than dramatized; cost legible via shell's crumble yet lacks tactical trade-off depth.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (delivering parcels past drones) tightens under Accumulative lens via escalating drone proximity. Cost felt in sustained tension, though physical stakes lack visceral escalation; "whirs piercing the hush" reweights hope's fragility without diminishing payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen via sensory accumulation (silence as canvas), but escalation lacks agency-driven pressure; the halo fragment's warmth resolves internal conflict too neatly without Elias overcoming resistance, muting the cost of breaking silence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake ("find story origin") signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; knowledge deepens via scarf's response without narrowing options or visible tactical cost beyond emotional transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake (capturing dream) deepens through protagonist agency, but pressure lacks textural escalation; archipelago's whispers remain static rather than intensifying during photography. Cost visible in tears but no felt trade-off in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (freeing trapped idea) tighten via disorientation sequence, narrowing options to courage-as-key. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, but cost (soul rift mending) remains conceptual; "improbable longing" surge lacks tangible trade-off despite emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate causally: observing light diffraction narrows options to pressing Orion-aligned mushroom. Visible cost in fragmented memories ("laughter... blurred at edges") alters tactics—she avoids blind touch. Agency drives every tightening; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reversing exile through resilience) tightens when Elara forces Kael to "tame your shadow," narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is felt in "resilience bloomed quietly within him"—endurance over triumph. Agency driven by Kael's micro-choices (complying with tea, analyzing leaves). "Reversible exile" mechanism lacks concrete failure consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens credibly as realities thin, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the cost is felt yet remains abstract ("wonder fading") without visceral, embodied consequences altering Elowen's tactics mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: each knot unraveled deepens silence-release pressure. Cost unmistakable in her trembling hands and "fear[ing] the unrest it would unleash" during the central betrayal reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes ("reopening hidden lore") never materialize as concrete risk; escalation flat with no tightening under Accumulative lens. No trade-off or visible cost when vibration discovery occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate via Elias's agency: each untangled thread narrows options toward surrender. Cost crystallizes in "knotting tighter with every dive" realization—visible trade-off where physics analysis yields to emotional release under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (freedom vs. eternal silence) escalate through Elowen's encoding under thunder's approach, with agency-driven payoff. Cost (thunder's timing) feels coincidental rather than earned by pressure escalation; dominant stake lacks deepening into moral complexity or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (joy beneath anguish) tightens through Elias’s agency—decoding choices escalate pressure floor by floor. Conceptual cost is unmistakable in his renunciation of the ritual, reweighting his ascent as "keeper" rather than servant.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stake "empty spaces remember" escalates through Elias' cloud-categorizing ritual tightening his focus toward the void, but agency remains observational rather than active choice; cost is emotional vulnerability in believing, legible via physical reaction to the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate via fractal density ("where did one layer end?"), but pressure feels externally imposed by coin rather than protagonist agency; cost legible yet tightening lacks organic protagonist struggle against recursion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen as murmurations shift from wonder to luminous guides, but cost remains conceptual (no physical/relational loss). Agency drives escalation via note-taking, though "stranded luminance" breakthrough lacks visceral pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (learning repair rhythm) signaled early but pressure lacks escalation—no meaningful tightening as gears assemble too easily; cost ("driftwood nostalgia") is legible yet abstract, failing to viscerally narrow options despite strong accumulative deepening through sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes signaled early (crumbling arches), but escalation lacks narrowing options. Resolution hinges on cosmic coincidence (nebula responding instantly to bell) rather than protagonist agency. "Reexamine divisions" theme remains abstract, never tested through concrete trade-offs like resource allocation or leadership conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (delaying end through lullaby) signaled early but pressure doesn't escalate meaningfully under Accumulative lens. Ritual deepens significance yet lacks narrowing of options or knowledge shift; tension remains static. Agency is clear but cost (temporary solace) feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. No visible price alters tactics mid-ritual, limiting escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten credibly as frost approaches, but Elara's internal conflict (escape vs duty) lacks sufficient friction during the beacon assembly; her reluctant motivation isn't tested by a meaningful trade-off beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through polymer insight ("building a bridge from separation"), but Lila's off-page response defuses tension; cost is felt via chrysalis symbolism yet lacks visceral on-page tradeoff during reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (finding story origins) tightens via moonlight depletion and numbered absences, but narrative fragments guarding nexus appear abruptly without escalation. Cost legible in identity forfeiture, yet pressure lacks meaningful middle development.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (confronting remorse) tightens through Elias' agency in tidal pool analysis and orb subsumption; cost legible in trembling pavilion and dissolved "bitter spikes," though resolution via "chef's intuition" risks convenience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (connecting communities) tightens when weight affixation transforms mechanism, narrowing options to linguistic bridge-building. Cost remains abstract—farmers' skepticism melts unrealistically fast with no personal sacrifice from Elara. Pressure accumulates via language blending but lacks tangible escalation beyond conceptual unity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain intellectualized without visceral escalation; seismic "intensification" feels coincidental rather than pressure-driven, failing to narrow options or force trade-offs despite clear dominant stake of dream excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (unearth combinations) tightens via time pressure and tendril confrontation. Cost legible in near-miss escape, but "seeds of vigilance" threat lacks mid-scene escalation beyond final attack.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: analyzing cracks as musical notation narrows options from observation to precise strumming, with cost legible in her tears. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as silence shifts from barrier to collaborator.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via nexus energy crescendo narrows options to "correlate or lose cycle," with cost legible in melancholy hope; dominant stake (redeeming silence) tightens through protagonist's active reweighting of past wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (serenity amid chaos) tightens through sensory accumulation, but escalation isn’t driven by Elara’s agency—the bloom erupts passively, weakening cost legibility despite her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (save orchard) escalate via inversion pressure, but cost legibility falters. Water-flow navigation tightens options, yet gravity normalization erases immediate peril—felt price (family's ruin) remains abstract, not dramatized in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preventing future disasters) tightens via patch discovery deepening convergence theory, but escalation lacks Mara's agency-driven tradeoffs. Cost remains conceptual (city's silence) rather than viscerally felt on-page; "scarred horizon" implies cost but doesn't charge it decisively under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens via ritual's intensifying demands under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual until release. Agency lacks adaptation—no meaningful trade-offs during strikes—softening escalation despite lyrical pressure build.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: silence builds "layer upon layer" until "crashing inward," narrowing options to confront failure; cost is felt in "truths that stung" during spectral visions.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency (printing phrases) under Accumulative lens as stars vanish; conceptual cost of accepting unsolvability is legible but could resonate more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (preserving wonder amid fading legacy) tighten through the pendant’s use, narrowing Elara’s options to a single act of transmission. Cost (her mythologization) is felt but slightly abstract; Kael’s transformation lacks tangible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Marcus's escalating engagement: mocking → leaning closer → gasping → touching. Cost ("shattered assumptions") is visceral and on-page. Agency lies in Elara's method driving the deepening, though Marcus's internal shift feels slightly rushed in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via Elias’ agency: lock discovery → memory-triggered backstory → painting-as-tool choice; cost is legible in hollow years ("corked his soul") and tears, though internal/external conflict interweaving remains optional at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: rain awakens viaduct → moon paths converge → signals pulse out, tightening the dominant stake (sculpting patience from impatience).

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake crystallization ("break free from controlling influence") deepens via hum's empirical mapping; escalation driven by Elena's agency (stopwatch timing) with unmistakable cost in the final vulnerability-to-strength shift under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (ringing unheard bell) signaled early; pressure accumulates via algorithm evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Internal stake (accepting abandoned dream) tightens through crystal whispers' intensifying pressure, narrowing options to endurance. Cost unmistakable in tears and weight-bearing, though escalation is subtle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten causally as Elara's patience pays off—geese resuming flight endorses her vigil, forcing the precise pressure-point presses. Cost is unmistakable in her altered worldview: "proving magic was just reality misunderstood" carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (breaking generational cycles) tightens via gear's simulations revealing "infinite stagnation." Escalation driven by agency (sonar pings refining patterns), but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, preventing 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: the pendulum's pause forces crystallization of his stance, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost is unmistakable—"fishermen returned with fuller nets" shows societal impact, reweighting the dominant stake via conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: the stormy gale session forces the elder’s weeping breakthrough, narrowing options toward fragile unity. Cost is visible in "harmony was fragile," but escalation lacks a second meaningful intensification beyond the initial subtraction method.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)

    Detour creates meaningful tightening by foreclosing safe path (fissure swallows original route), but volcanic eruption threat resolved off-page via bugs' light weakens tangible cost escalation under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
