  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: validate the algorithm to translate cosmic and human timescales, which Mara frames as "strip needless drama." One meaningful tightening occurs when the synchrotron pings convergence, narrowing her emotional options and forcing the choice to accept rather than outrun grief. The storm and failing equipment raise external pressure; her decision to ignore imminent danger and continue working demonstrates agency under stress. The cost is legible: she relinquishes the urge to escape and accepts "ongoing becoming" with its attendant vulnerability. No reversals, but the Accumulative lens accommodates this as a deepening rather than a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose in the pauses rather than following the smuggler route—is signaled early and threads through the canyon journey. The hollow scene provides one meaningful tightening: she stops, reads the schism in kicked dust, and chooses to wait rather than push onward, which narrows her options and reweights the ledger's function. However, the escalation is more contemplative than dramatic; the protagonist's agency at the hollow is primarily internal and told ("she understood"), and the visible cost (crushing charcoal, scattering the ledger) lands as symbolic rather than foreclosing a live tactical option with immediate consequence. The obsidian payment and bus ride function as exits rather than pressure-driven choices, softening the sense of earned stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—translating post-capsizing silence into legible expression—is clear early. The fork-striking sequence tightens as Mara builds notation (fear, grief, wonder), and the audience of thermal silhouettes responding is a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation remains internal and accumulative; no live obstacle forces a trade-off. The scanner's battery death arrives as coincidence rather than consequence of Mara's choice, weakening the sense of agency-driven cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (revitalizing the distress signal to release accumulated souls) is signaled by the midpoint and drives the final act. One meaningful tightening occurs: the lens remains fractured after insertion, forcing the undertaker to improvise with the paper-boat ritual. However, escalation is thin—no on-page resistance complicates his descent or repair, and the octopus's tethering feels like a consequence rather than a choice under pressure. The cost (permanent tenure, tethered ankle, empty parlor) is legible but arrives as acceptance rather than a dramatized trade-off that forecloses a live option. Agency is passive: he is summoned, he follows, he accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—sustaining the network through sanctions—is signaled early and tightens when Lita warns "memories will be rationed too." Mara's agency is visible in the decision to triple frequency and in placing the final pebble, both of which foreclose easier paths. The cost is legible: the cart empties, dawn arrives without guaranteed resupply, and the spiral remains incomplete. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal; one meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored before it rots the heart—is signaled early and pursued through the camera ritual. The encounter with the man introduces modest pressure when his "rattled" breath matches her "quiver inside her ribcage," but the escalation is driven by shared ritual rather than protagonist agency or conflicting goals. The orchard passage offers a deepening (biting fruit releases "apologies never risked") yet reads as revelation rather than a choice that narrows options with felt cost. The final distribution of love and the parting "without names" lack the visible trade-off or forfeited path that would demonstrate cost scaled to the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to escape duration or become its keystone—is signaled early through the fading photographs and builds through the maze's tightening loops. One major tightening: when she tears the ring free, the bridge disintegrates and a door appears, forcing the threshold choice with explicit price (roots replacing veins). Her agency is renunciation with visible cost: she seals the fragment, accepts perpetual loss, and the corridor spirals back. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights her relationship to forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: protect the seed vault from regime looters before the wall collapse buries it. One tightening occurs when guards storm in and she must impede them without gunfire, forcing the dance-and-net tactic. The resolution is driven by her agency (decoding, luring, planting), and cost is legible: regime will reclaim ground by dusk, she walks away still chained. However, the guards' superstition-driven hesitation feels convenient, and the netting trap materializes without prior setup, softening the earned quality of the turn. Escalation under the Causal lens is present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing trust's fracture-sound—is signaled early and tightens when the keeper demands "what you miss most." Mara's decision to feed her brother's absence to the forge is the lone reversal, raising cost by revealing her complicity. Agency is renunciation (admitting doubt) with conceptual cost, but physical consequence is muted: she pockets the shard and walks away without immediate trade-off. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening once through forge encounter. Cost is legible in the final image but not viscerally felt as a forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake: the hooded woman's desire to restore her husband's memory. The thief's agreement and her demand for the ring as collateral introduce one meaningful tightening. The realization (the woman had stolen the memory herself) reverses sympathy and reweights the transaction. However, escalation is gentle; the thief's choice to merge the woman's own face with the moonbeams feels like a solution discovered rather than forced by narrowing options. No live clock or visible resource depletion applies pressure. The woman's tears and the thief's decision carry emotional cost, but the price—one portrait from the satchel—does not foreclose a path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: craft a safe zone for inquiry (material goal tied to emotional healing). One meaningful tightening occurs when the cornice crashes and Mara "felt oddly confident," then places the dome and decides to leave it behind—a choice that forecloses her escape plan and crystallizes her stance with visible cost. Her agency (narrating tasks, using the bookmark, abandoning the dome) drives the turn. The textural escalation—dripping quickens, her laugh startles her, the thawing heart rearranges—accumulates pressure toward the final renunciation without requiring a set-piece confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—proving he is more than expendable muscle before the heirs retire his brand—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates causally: DNA test → hunt → decrypt → find → confront guards → outwit. The shell's whisper ("keep the trembling take") provides the key tightening that transforms Leo's tactic from flight to confrontation, narrowing his options and forcing a trade-off (safety vs. self-exposure). One meaningful reversal: Leo's phobia flares when the guards arrive, yet he acts against instinct, placing the shell on the projector instead of running. The cost is visible in his "heart still quaking" and the decision to leak the reel, which forecloses his old identity. Minor caveat: the guards' hesitation while watching the footage feels slightly convenient, reducing the antagonistic pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the map before the last star dies—is signaled early and creates a ticking clock. However, the oracle faces no meaningful opposition or reversal; she simply progresses through her task until the star expires and the transformation occurs. The ending reweights her existence (she becomes part of the map), but this shift arrives as atmospheric culmination rather than through a choice that forecloses options or exacts visible cost. The accumulative pressure is present but doesn't tighten or deepen meaningfully in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding thought's origin—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. The 373 loops accumulate offstage; the on-page action (approach violin, play note, resume mopping) proceeds without reversal or cost-laden trade-off. The "revolution in neural architecture" is told, not tested. No live option is foreclosed on the page; acceptance of repetition carries conceptual weight but lacks felt price in the dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—thaw mistrust with transparency—signals early and drives Mira's hunt for the lens. The eavesdrop delivers one meaningful tightening: she learns the doodles are a staged test, reframes her goal from exposing guilt to enabling absolution, and chooses silent reconciliation over confrontation. The projector screening exerts pressure on Rico and Jun, who fear exposure. Cost is visible in Mira's renunciation of vindication and theAnnotated open-lock ticket. One friction: the escalation hinges on the overheard revelation rather than a choice that narrows Mira's own options under mounting pressure, which slightly reduces protagonist agency in the peak turn.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is proving the garden knows its gardener, signaled early and sustained throughout. The 0.03% luck score creates one meaningful pressure point: the garden immediately responds by revealing the impossible apple, forcing Elara to confront the reciprocal nature of their relationship. The final recognition—that neither leads, both dance—forecloses her belief in mastery with visible cost (relinquishing control). However, escalation operates through accumulative revelation rather than narrowing tactical choices under rising pressure. The garden's cooperation ensures Elara faces no genuine opposition, only deepening understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove that time moves sideways and explore the choice to keep or reverse her prosthetic lungs. The lever-pull tightens options by showing both futures, forcing her to choose intervention or patience. Agency is clear: she lowers the lever by degrees, steps sideways with time, then steps back and centers it, refusing to intervene—a renunciation that forecloses the path of altering her younger self with visible cost (she remains the station's organ). Escalation deepens under the Accumulative lens via subsonic moth-bat patterns and the lattice of possible choices. No artificial reversals; pressure coheres to the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the ghost's message—is signaled early and drives the descent sequence. Pressure accumulates through the program's unfolding images and the physical journey deeper into the flooded space, providing one meaningful tightening when the hidden chamber is reached. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off or cost: the musician simply accepts the "gift" and plays, with no on-page demonstration of what path is foreclosed or what price is paid. The ghost's backstory (betrayed soprano) adds texture but does not create a reversal or choice that narrows the musician's options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: finding the weight of the swallowed truth before it sprouts. Pressure tightens through accumulation—sketches warping, rootlet piercing diaphragm, aurora arrival—forcing the oracle outside to smudge the illustration deliberately. The agency is clear: she chooses to erase leaf by leaf, sacrificing external images to surface the internal stone, then expels it with visible cost (4.7 grams of sorrow, sky clearing, temporary innocence). The final act forecloses her protective role with felt consequence. One causal slip: the stranger's seed-offering is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the initial turn.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—witnessing/weighing the brother's truth and the ghost shift's claim—is signaled early and tightens when Mara unscrews the wheel and the tag emerges. Her spoken challenge ("If you want weight, take it; if you want witness, I'm here") forces the shift's answer and narrows her path. The cost is legible: she must carry the truth now "no longer lead but brass." One limitation: the ghost shift's response (wheel jerking, beads rattling, sloshing stilled) edges toward convenient validation rather than Mara's agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—preservation or witness of the library's silence—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure that would force a trade-off. The keeper moves through the space without on-page escalation: she "followed," "traced," "understood," "stepped" in a sequence of passive verbs that do not narrow options or raise cost. The anecdote of trying to save a war chronicle "centuries ago" is told rather than dramatized and does not generate present friction. The transformation at the end is presented as inevitable acceptance rather than a choice with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed because no alternative path was legibly present. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is required, but the final image reweights the keeper's role through assertion ("she was to become the next fold") rather than through a pressure point that alters tactics or forces renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder to the valley children—is signaled early and tightens through the eclipse ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the whistle "trembled, almost failing" and Elara steadies it by pressing the curl to her wrist, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. The children's responses (spoon, controller pulse, widening eyes) serve as signs of effect rather than agentic escalation, which limits felt cost. The ending lands with conceptual price ("never finished, only handed onward") visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—collecting stories walls have heard—is signaled in the second paragraph and escalates through three diaries that reveal the displaced axis. The historian's choices (probe with sable brush, climb to locate the second diary, press tapestry to concrete) narrow options and the final transfer forecloses her prior role with visible cost. One tightening point: the mechanism by which the tapestry "transfers" dragons into the silo could be more causally grounded, but the accumulative lens allows pattern-driven escalation and the cost at closure (solitude traded, her body now the axis) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Chen's orchestrated disappearance, signaled early ("transpose life into a new key"). One meaningful tightening: planting the film-cookie and stepping into the skiff narrows options from cryptic espionage to self-erasure. Agency is visible (untying the skiff, whispering "not fortunes but lyrics"), and the cost is legible—he abandons buyers, coordinates, his sage role. Escalation under the Accumulative lens accumulates through recurring motifs (open secret, pulse syncing with beam), but the keeper's drunkenness and Chen's ease undercut immediate pressure; coincidence (supply skiff, keeper's distraction) facilitates rather than complicates the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prevent the possession by starving the demon of certainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the first tremor of otherworldly cold" arrives and the priest deploys the ultraviolet color, then layering loops into "chords of contradiction." The demon's hesitation—"it required a host who knew what they wanted, and the congregation now knew only questions"—narrows options and forces the priest's final sacrifice: stepping into his own loop. Cost is legible: he becomes the anchor, body slackened, a living statue. The escalation under the accumulative lens is coherent; pressure mounts through layered contradictions until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—conducting unheard symphonies by mapping childhood memories before exhaustion hits—is signaled early and the timeframe tightens (thirty minutes, fifteen minutes left). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirrored horizon reflects tomorrow's exhausted face, urging her to hurry. Yet escalation relies on the clock and memory accumulation rather than protagonist agency narrowing options; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution (nautilus crumbles, horizon folds, symphony waits) lands as lyric inevitability rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the elder Kael introduces the minotaur concept, narrowing Kael's options to "erase" the sequence of choices. The tablet-smashing act attempts escalation through symbolic agency, yet the stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally tested. No live trade-off or visible price (resource, relationship, bodily cost) dramatizes what Kael loses by destroying the tablet and stepping off the viaduct.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness—signals early and tightens via the needle-repair sequence and the backward lullaby that peels protective layers. The reversal: numbness gives way to "loud" grief, a trade Mara accepts with visible cost (she keeps the needle as reminder, commits to teaching touch-listening). Agency is renunciation of safety for raw pain. One tightening deepening is sufficient at this length; the choice forecloses the muffled cocoon with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (data integrity vs. state censorship) is signaled early and escalates through the forged vellum dated tomorrow, the follower's pressure, and the revelation that Zone 9 quarantines truth rather than disease. Elara's agency drives the tightening: she chooses descent over compliance, writes backward-dated counter-logs, and releases them laterally—each choice narrows options and raises cost. The final decision to stay underground "until screens overflow" forecloses her prior routine with visible price. Coincidence (pigeon arrival) complicates but does not resolve; the resolution is earned by her counter-recording and patient stance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transcendence versus remaining embodied. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator finds Marcus's hiding place and shifts from passive observation to active pattern-writing. Agency manifests as endurance and attention rather than decisive confrontation, which suits the Accumulative lens, but the final walk feels like a continuation of drift rather than a tightening that forecloses a path. The energy beings' offer provides situational pressure, yet they remain passive observers rather than active antagonists. Cost is implied (accepting "Earth's slow decay") but not made viscerally felt in a single beat; the narrator's choice to walk carries emotional weight yet lacks a visible price that alters tactics or closes an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: reimagining family tradition (survival-by-performance to creation-without-audience) is signaled early and tested on the page. Pressure accumulates through planting the seed, constructing the wire-bridge, and playing unfinished phrases until the greenhouse "kept breathing." The seedling's emergence and Mara's departure constitute a tightening that forecloses the mendicant path with felt cost. No explicit antagonist, but the "chronic hush" and shipwreck silence apply situational pressure. Agency is clear: Mara's choices (planting, building the resonator, leaving the bowl) drive the turn. Cost is visible in walking away from both crowd and bowl.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding vs. selling) is signaled early and tightens when Lira presses the petal to her wrist, a micro-choice with immediate consequence. The scent's release of clients' emotions—grief, rage, child's wonder—escalates pressure by forcing her to feel what she'd commodified. The transformation completes with visible cost: her detachment "lay folded beside her like a discarded coat," and the cracked vial she won't check. Agency is clear (she chose the petal, chose to stay), though the chemist's departure feels slightly passive in its lack of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring cycles of compassion and uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation remains gentle: Marisol agrees to deliver the envelope, they decipher the address, and she drafts a receipt. No reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the locket exchange is framed as continuation rather than sacrifice. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than causal tightening, and the story achieves one meaningful reweighting when the envelope's purpose is revealed, yet the protagonist's agency at closure is more symbolic gesture than constrained choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira's need to belong—is signaled early and sustained. The shared search with the twins provides one meaningful tightening when they find the heron tag, and Lira's choice to touch it first forecloses her prior stance as outsider with visible cost (physical buckling, forced vulnerability). However, the escalation is primarily internal and reflective; the street artist remains elusive and off-page, so external pressure never truly narrows her options—she succeeds in her search without material obstacle or trade-off beyond emotional surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the echo-birthplace and recover her mother's final syllable. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira must choose between caging the sounds or surrendering her future minutes—the pendant offering is a trade-off with visible cost ("tiny boats of digits that sailed away"). The giant's nap provides a ticking constraint. Escalation is gentle and accumulative rather than sharp reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible on the page and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—solving the ambiguous loss of the master—is signaled early and sustains pressure through the conjurer's ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass eyes align and the mosaic opens, narrowing options from abstract grief to concrete action. The protagonist's agency is embodied in the ritual steps (placing eyes, climbing, projecting light), though the escalation accumulates through texture and atmosphere rather than reversals. Cost is visible in the acceptance of ambiguity ("no certainty, only buried optimism") but remains conceptual; no live option is foreclosed with immediate stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias's desire to become visible to someone who needs the cached voices. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens as he methodically uncovers fragments; the girl's arrival and her tears at Lorca's voice provide the tightening that narrows options (he must reveal himself or remain hidden). The final fragment—his own voice—is the protagonist's decisive choice that forecloses solitary invisibility with visible cost: "would not cache alone anymore" signals the loss of his self-contained existence. Agency is clear; the cost is felt and scales appropriately to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to control versus the plants' uncontrollable communication—is signaled early and tightens through the storm sequence. The linden leaf syncing with her pulse and the pain blooming mark a clear escalation point. However, the resolution "she released her grip on understanding" is more stated than dramatized through a visible trade-off or agonized choice; the transformation proceeds inevitably rather than through Mira's agency at the hinge. The cost is visible (human form, consciousness scattered), but the peak beat lacks protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—threshing meaning from ruin—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete consequence (lost commission, failed relationship, physical peril) tests it. The exchange with the old woman offers mutual recognition rather than a choice with trade-offs; Mara paints, receives water, and walks home without forgoing a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (insomnia reframed), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally felt—she simply sleeps for the first time in months with no on-page price paid. The painting and vial are gifts freely given; no resource or relationship is spent to earn them.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and tightens when the clairvoyant transfers her gift via the cave pearl, foreclosing her future sight and binding him to carry the amplified ordinary. One meaningful deepening occurs: his acceptance of the scar and its cost (her entrapment, his exile from the cave) narrows options and charges the ending. The price is legible on the page—she remains, voice eroding; he leaves—and the final park scene demonstrates the stake's transformation. Escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as density increase and cadence shift rather than reversals, meeting sufficiency for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—compile fragments to hearten the city—is signaled early and drives the search. Pressure tightens when the janitor reveals the missing mouthpiece's location and again when the woman demands exchange, narrowing options from hunt to negotiation. The narrator's agency is present (offering the echo-archive entry) but the woman's acquiescence feels cooperative rather than hard-won; no tactic fails or forces a visible trade-off. The final trumpet note is the story's only on-page action that attempts to "hearten," so the stake's test arrives late and resolves without complication. One meaningful deepening (the exchange) is sufficient for this length, but escalation reads smooth rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Alden came "hoping to quit his obsessive redrawing" but instead confronts unspoken truths. The dare escalates through symbolic intensification—lies flutter out, larger silences appear, the fortress materializes—culminating in his choice to punch his own chest and speak. Agency is decision and renunciation: each confession lights a compartment and heals arrows, foreclosing his escape-route habit with visible cost (the fortress folds into a blank canvas, the tunnel seals). Accumulative pressure coheres; the tightening is one meaningful deepening that narrows his options to "Speak or be spoken for." Cost is legible in the final image: he walks home "carrying nothing but the trembling certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will transcribe the tile's digits or surrender to its demand for participation—is signaled early and tightens when starlight triggers the memory surge. Her choice at midnight to write musical notation instead of academic transcription is a meaningful deepening, forecloses the path of "proof by reason alone," and carries visible cost (the roll goes into her mother's empty notebook, unpublishable). The escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens: she aligns the astrolabe, listens, writes, and releases the tile. However, the pressure could be sharper if the consequences of failing to transcribe or the mother's notebooks' specific stakes were dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—Vey's search for what lies after goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when the amulet reveals the door. The technicians' mutiny complicates but does not resolve; Vey's agency (passing the amulet, stepping through) drives the turn. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vey offers exile in exchange for help, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off. Cost is visible: Vey surrenders immortality's certainty, the woman inherits compelled wandering. Escalation is linear rather than multi-reversal, fitting the length, though the storm's anchor failure reads slightly coincidental in timing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—redeeming her mother's name via the asylum grant—is signaled early and pursued with agency. The tightening occurs when Cassidy dips the nib, sacrificing her last honest memory; Rurik's granite policies liquefy into negotiable text. Cost is visible: the lullaby melody vanishes forever, the ink solidifies, and Rurik retches as convictions harden inward. The equation she rehearses throughout pays off at closure with a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Aurelia's need to collect temporal textures and maintain her forgery practice—is signaled early and drives her to the mountaintop. One meaningful tightening occurs when the labyrinth begins reading her inventories and growing real what had been only ink, forcing her to confront the consequences of her invented histories. The escalation is accumulative: each texture she records reshapes the bonsai, raising the cost from abstract forgery to tangible transformation. Her continued writing despite fear of "exhausting the world's longing" provides a visible choice, though the moment feels more reflective than viscerally pressured. The final act—launching the paper glider that ignites and fertilizes the bonsai—reweights the stakes with conceptual cost: history becomes real, seeded by her inventions. Agency is present but leans toward observation; the labyrinth's agency rivals hers.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving Mara existed despite erasure—is signaled early and tightens through the archive discovery and the captain's revelation that the poison erases names systematically. Her decision to "invert the poison's purpose" by gluing voice fragments to containers narrows her options (she commits to visibility despite remaining officially dead) and the ending shows a visible trade: she gains memorial presence but remains nameless, a cost that charges the final image. One meaningful deepening (archive to active memorial creation) suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and drives Arlen's actions. The three notes create a meaningful deepening as each summons a voice and reshapes memory, and the fourth note (silence shaped like a spiral) triggers the epiphany. However, the escalation is largely internal and conceptual; no external opposition tightens options, and the final act (pocketing the compass, walking away) doesn't narrow a path with visible cost. The piece lacks a trade-off or price that alters later tactics; Arlen gains insight and a compass without losing agency or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (survival vs. integrity) is signaled early and tightens through Syndicate arrival, graffiti signal, and midnight assembly decision. The overnight reorganization creates a meaningful reversal that narrows options with visible cost: prizes become poems on dissolving rice paper, investors retreat confused, but "capital would return with bigger barges." Agency is collective but earned through Lina's call and the assembly's embodied response. The piece delivers one solid tightening; the cost (postponement, not victory) is legible and scaled appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—photograph the last blooming before UV bleaches them sterile—is signaled early and tightened by the forty-three-minute timer. The chemical grain mechanism creates escalation: larger half darkens on schedule, smaller half warns when the moment has passed, and she "held her breath to stop the tremor" as the blossoms folded. Agency is decision and endurance: she waits past hesitation, fires three times, and the ending confirms she "captured the last possible second." The cost is legible—her contract expires at sunrise, no seed bank exists, and witnessing cannot prevent extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (village antidotes depend on drone launch before Aurora departs) is signaled early and tightens through the seven-minute countdown. Escalation reads Causal: wing fracture → battery swell → successful patch → feedback jitter (reversal) → water-barrel recalibration → launch. Lira's agency drives each beat, and the water-barrel solution arises from her own trauma memory (infirmary bandages → teaching the drone to translate terror). Cost is visible in the final release and the village's dependency, though the protagonist's competence is so assured that genuine failure never feels plausible, slightly flattening peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—"where do the rivers begin?"—is signaled early via the phrasebook and Maren's six-winter catalog work. One meaningful tightening: the falcon's death and the radio's "convergence" force Maren to descend; recognition that convergence is a moment (not a map coordinate) narrows her choice to witness or report. The final act—tearing the page, letting it dissolve, refusing to transmit coordinates—is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses her Registry career with visible cost. The Registry's demand for coordinates becomes the final pressure point she refuses.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring Viremont by tuning its bones—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the north ward refuses to rise, forcing Elian to offer his own heartbeat (a visible price). However, the escalation feels more like a checklist sequence (walk seven times, strike keystone, press fork to sternum) than a pressure curve driven by setbacks or narrowing options. The final sacrifice is legible but arrives without prior resistance or tactical adjustment; coincidence does not intrude, but agency remains thin because the tuner's method unfolds as planned rather than through improvisation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (survive and be heard) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes she must "feed the organ one pure note" to amplify her distress—this narrows options and forces a trade-off (sacrifice the vial or remain unheard). The turn from temple-as-adversary to temple-as-ally is earned by her agency (uncorking the vial, translating scent into frequency). Cost is visible: she loses her last anchor to home. However, the arrival of the rescue sub after the signal succeeds reads slightly mechanized; the causal link between her broadcast and the reply could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Cassian threading his father's story to find his own exit—is declared early but never tested by a concrete on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. The timeframe "before they find the bodies" is invoked twice but exerts no pressure on Cassian's decisions; no clock tightens tactics. The father's appearance and Cassian's descent are sequential without causal friction; coincidence (the hush pools, the floor hovers) complicates atmosphere but does not escalate conflict. No visible price is paid; the final claim "I am exact" asserts resolution without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (debt repayment) is signaled early, but escalation reads as accumulation of visits rather than a tightening choice or reversal. The boy's offer of blood is refused without a trade-off that narrows options; the fruit-harvest solution appears as revelation rather than a decision under pressure. Cost is visible (trees wither, bead cracks, bride dissolves) but the boy's own forfeiture is unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: restore the tide by weaving broken precedents into the loom. Pressure accumulates through the descent, the convergence of kelp/footprints/sleepwalking, and the climactic sewing. One meaningful deepening occurs when Calyx pricks his palm, adding his blood to the plate—a tightening that raises personal cost. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than agentic; the loom "began to turn of its own accord" and the canyon's "sigh" grants passages, suggesting external facilitation rather than protagonist-driven turns. The cost is legible (plate dissolves, loom sinks) but does not foreclose a live option—Calyx "returned... ready for the next night," implying cyclical recurrence rather than a trade-off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring faith by rebuilding the prayer house—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through discovery (mirrors, root-road) and ritual (sundial placement, hymn-teaching), but escalation is gradual rather than tightening through forced choices. The climax (gnomon plants, walls reassemble) is magical rather than agentive; the protagonist waits rather than decides under competing costs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the roots move and she follows, yet the final act lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path—convenience (dawn, magic, travelers) resolves the problem without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to send the confession or remain hidden—is clear from the opening. Pressure tightens through the drone's approach and the time constraint (6:17 a.m.), and the protagonist's agency drives the final choice. However, the escalation reads as steady accumulation rather than a sharp reversal or deepening that forecloses options with felt urgency. The cost (choosing anonymity over authenticity) is conceptually present but lacks the visceral or relational charge that would push this into the high band under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup by finishing and revealing the map before dawn—is signaled early. Pressure is linear: she gathers information, stitches the dual-layer map, times the reveal at three bells, and succeeds. The astronomers' laughter and the lieutenant's drawn pistol offer a micro reversal, but his hand trembles and lowers without the embroiderer altering her own tactics or paying a visible price; her soft speech about adjacent possibilities persuades without friction. One meaningful tightening (the three-bell deadline) narrows the window, but escalation remains declarative rather than forcing a trade-off with legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (delivering the apology) is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate meaningfully—the journey proceeds without resistance, and the protagonist simply arrives, speaks, and is released. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the medium's guidance is smooth rather than contested. Agency at closure is minimal: the protagonist kneels and speaks, but the act feels granted rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice. Cost is symbolic (moths, healed lip) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: unknotting the notes to redeem past mistranslation and shared trauma. The narrator's agency is renunciation and ritual speech; the tightening occurs when the birthday and village name are recognized, raising the cost of naming. The child's whispered imperative and finger-tap add pressure. Escalation under the accumulative lens is one deepening move (confession replaces inventory) and a cadence shift at closure (ache becomes sediment). Cost is felt in the weight transfer and the narrator's return tomorrow to radios and ultimatums, but the stakes remain largely internal and symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and tightens through a clear sequence: fragment discovery, Lattice invocation, projection onto the living wall. The act of painting costs "a sigh of present sorrow" per brushstroke, and the fragment dissolves into the mural, binding past to present with visible sacrifice (empty pocket, over-exposed heart). One meaningful deepening occurs when the impossible film becomes real, reweighting memory from lost to recoverable. The tightening is gentle but legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring color versus accepting incompleteness—is signaled early. The nickel's barter ("certainty for curiosity") promises a tightening but delivers only conceptual layering; Liora's tactics do not narrow or change under pressure. The inverted sound wave drains color "into possibility," a thematic gesture without visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page; she ends kneeling, walking, and unborn simultaneously—charged language that diffuses rather than crystallizes cost. Escalation reads as accumulation of images rather than rising pressure that forces a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—planting seven message-glyphs before dawn to wake defiance—is signaled early. Voss's arrival tightens pressure, and Arlo's evasion via Lucretius passphrase and pollen clouds creates a micro-reversal. However, escalation feels more additive than causal; the greenhouse sequence could be swapped with another garden without structural loss. The final image gestures toward systemic impact but the on-page cost (one seed planted, one inspector evaded) does not meaningfully narrow Arlo's options or test his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: end the cycle of sleepless longing and seed peace. The stake is signaled early and deepens when Zale reads the postcard's postscript and peels it apart, releasing the blossoms. However, escalation is textural (accumulating metaphor, glowing blossoms) rather than a decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The resolution—sleep pressing "not as surrender but as alliance"—feels granted rather than earned through agency. No live alternative is foreclosed; Zale completes the ritual without friction or sacrifice legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve extinct names or let them vanish—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chandelier demands memory-for-name payment, forcing serial forfeiture. Yet the escalation is mechanical: each name costs one memory in identical transactions, no complication or resistance. The final self-erasure deepens thematically but arrives as logical extension rather than a pressured choice that narrows live options. Agency is present (she selects which memories) but the cost never alters her tactics or creates friction between want and capability.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust via the symphonies—is signaled early and persists. The archive's resistance (candles snuffing, mural reveal) tightens pressure in the middle, forcing Elara's restitution offer. That offer narrows options and enables the completion, meeting the causal lens's escalation test. The final act (leaving the ink well) forecloses the path of keeping control, with cost legible in her absence. One meaningful tightening and a visible trade-off justify mid-7 eligibility, but the cost could be more visceral; the "street vendors hear it" epilogue dilutes immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing the farmers' and fishers' conflicting demands without bloodshed—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mireya sings the lullaby and the amphitheater transforms discord into duet, forcing both sides to hear each other's necessity. The compromise (gates opened at moonrise for three nights, closed at moonset) narrows options and earns the delegations' nod. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless: no visible resistance after the acoustic transformation, no competing goods dramatized in the final choice. The cost is implied in "not defeated but enlarged," but we don't witness a trade-off or see what Mireya or the delegations sacrifice to reach this point.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs while evading capture—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the constables trace the paper trails, but the resolution (Mirela's departure) happens off-page, diluting the on-page cost. Her balancing exercises accumulate texture but do not narrow live options or force a dramatized trade-off. Mr. Blackwood's offer of sanctuary and the micro-sheet melody network add complications, yet the constables' arrival feels coincidental rather than a consequence of Mirela's prior choices, and her escape is recounted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Juniper finds the carved spiral and steps off the terrace, narrowing her path toward the final realization. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decision with visible trade-off; she does not forfeit a competing desire on the page. The butterfly effect and maze-building backstory add texture but remain expository context rather than on-page pressure that forces choice. Cost is conceptual (accepting her father's absence, moving forward alone) but not concretely foreclosed within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—complete the ritual before the submersible surfaces at sunrise—is signaled but never tested through meaningful opposition. The astrologer encounters no obstacles that force trade-offs; the ghost awaits her, the tools are available, the valve opens. The ticking clock (until sunrise) is declared but does not narrow her options on the page. The ritual's completion feels preordained rather than earned through agency, and the "cost" of returning to the surface is asserted thematically rather than shown as a forfeited alternative with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and remains coherent. The story deepens when Lira realizes the cliff grew lonely, and she responds by creating a new path rather than restoring the old. Yet escalation is gentle: the bird's seeds reveal the past, ash spells "remember," and the mosaic grinds into a ribbon of light without Lira facing a hard trade-off or forcing a difficult choice under pressure. The resolution feels cooperative (the ground accepts the path, the cave seals) rather than won through protagonist agency against resistance. Cost is conceptual (the promise to remember, the acceptance of letting the old path stay gone) but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Cipher's desire to orchestrate serendipity and break monotony—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The escalation is accumulative: cup placement → ferret leaps → flashlight spears guard → soapy cascade → strangers connect → music erupts. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is renunciation (walking away from the slot) rather than a decision that narrows options with visible cost; the tightening is conceptual, not tactical. The ferret's cascade is largely coincidental complication rather than Cipher-driven, and the slot-machine pull feels thematically resonant but mechanically convenient, capping the score at mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: pen a verse the censors cannot confiscate. Pressure tightens once when the moonstone dust dims and demands sacrifice to complete the stanza, narrowing her window before dawn. Agency is present in her choice to dance the gaps and let the dust inscribe her skin. The resolution—becoming the forbidden memory—feels more like thematic crystallization than a turn driven by on-page conflict; no antagonist or reversal complicates her path. Cost is legible (dust burns out, exile deepens) but the escalation is primarily atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist decisions under opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"to illuminate value in the mundane before the world's great inventory closed its ledger at sunrise"—is signaled early and frames Mara's ritual. The piece deepens through the three memory-images and the prism's flare, but no reversal or narrowing occurs; Mara's plan unfolds as intended with no friction or adaptation. Agency is present (she speaks, hurls the prism), yet the act forecloses no live option and carries no visible tradeoff. The ending grants her success without cost, failing the escalation test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: speak the pain versus swallow it in silence. The piece tightens through one meaningful deepening—tasting the ash transforms it into ink, enabling the spiral drawing—that narrows Elias's options from silent carrying to active testimony. The final commitment (visiting survivors' group, showing the inked spiral) forecloses the path of mute endurance with on-page cost (he is "not forgiven" but "commissioned"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, but no sharp reversal tests commitment; the escalation reads more as ritual unfolding than a choice under competing pressures, keeping this in mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing consensus reality by solving an equation of hope—is signaled early but remains abstract. There is one tightening: the blood-drop variable completes the equation and the balloon rises. Yet this feels more like task completion than a narrowing of options under pressure. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the parallel timelines and "other Miras" diffuse agency rather than concentrating it. The ending's "one meter above hope" reads as a conceptual win without visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping the acoustics, then discovering the echo's origin—is signaled early and tightens through the diary discovery, the photograph of herself, and the descent into the unmapped tunnel. The final image forecloses her prior identity with visible cost (she becomes the archive, the rescue team finds only a negative). Escalation proceeds through accumulative discovery rather than protagonist agency in the causal sense, which fits the inferred lens; one meaningful deepening (the realization that Livia designed a camera, not a building) reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: persuade mirrors to show possibilities. The piece offers a tightening (third mirror refuses unless she surrenders the heartbeat) but the choice itself is frictionless—she weighs it in one sentence, then decides without visible internal cost or trade-off. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the heartbeat functions as symbolic bait rather than a resource under pressure. Escalation reads as conceptual intensification (three mirrors, increasing demand) without on-page struggle that forecloses a live option with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (anchoring memory to enable peace-as-practice) is signaled early and escalates through the ritual sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen realizes "the price of redemption was not forgetting, but remembering rightly," which shifts his intent from burning the clipboard to collective witness. The Skyborne and Deepkin gathering and contributing fragments provides external pressure, though their arrival feels more coincidental complication than protagonist-driven turn. Cost at closure is conceptual (distributed burden, role shift) but could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: preserving/hearing the extinct bird's echo before it evaporates. The tightening is protagonist-driven: he engineered the drought, bribed climatologists to time the storm, and chose to swallow the sound. The swallowing forecloses preservation in the world and binds the echo to his body, a visible trade-off. One meaningful reversal: from external preservation attempt to internal imprisonment. The cost is clear—the echo will live parasitically off his pulse, and every future utterance will carry absence—charging the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: defy the lullaby or the city falls into eternal obedience by dawn. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lys undoes the last knot and the core opens, releasing the echoes and burning her contract. Agency is present but largely procedural—she executes the weaver's method without on-page friction, doubt, or improvisation. The mad weaver's post-closure offer of passage is declined, but the refusal arrives after the main conflict resolves and carries no visible cost that alters the ending. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation from arrival to unlock to collective awakening is legible, yet the lack of a mid-scene complication or pivot limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—ethical storytelling after the gallery quarrel—is signaled early, but escalation remains flat. The stick-burning ritual is presented as magical solution rather than a tightening that narrows options or raises cost. Lucien's final stance ("letter with questions rather than answers") is articulated through manifesto rather than forced by a trade-off with visible price. No live option is foreclosed; he simply gains wisdom and leaves. The Accumulative lens requires a meaningful intensification or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost—here the reversal is conceptual decoration without felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the butterflies' arrival and the memorial's assembly, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options. The butterfly's appearance and the structure lifting feel coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The "interrupted cadence" motif deepens atmospherically but does not force a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: preserve forgotten names before glacier erases them. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: entering the sanctum, warming the rope, threading it through the card's holes, and finally repeating names aloud so rivers carry them. The rope-braiding creates a tightening that narrows options (the card will dissolve; voices must now be carried forward by the protagonist). Visible cost: the protagonist is "heavier by the cargo of voices" and must continue the repetition. The escalation is accumulative—each step (forgiveness, entry, rope work, voice release, repetition) deepens the commitment with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through the storm's approach and the wafer seal's integration, yet no concrete option is foreclosed or traded off on the page. The protagonist's passivity (lying down, waiting, letting the storm walk her) means escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by her agency. One tightening occurs when the seal melts and rewrites itself, but the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Under the Accumulative lens, this is functional but does not reach the high band's demand for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown before the new regime erases the old sky charts—is signaled early and frames Naram-bel's urgency. The tile's use (drawing, pressing against the door) provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options: he gains access to the sanctum and completes the schematic. Yet the escalation is told more than dramatized: the door opens "as if empirically ironic," the constellations project futures, the prophecy arrives without visible friction or cost-in-the-moment. The final oath forecloses teaching and binds him to silence, a credible cost, but the choice feels preordained by plot rather than forced by a dilemma with visible trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—convincing war-ghosts to release resentment—is signaled immediately and pressure tightens when the shadow-self forces Lira to confront her own unopened anger. The broken pin's failure creates escalation (the music box falters, "rhythm stumbling like a heart in arrest") and her acceptance of the shadow forecloses the path of unexamined rage. The cost is visible: she metabolizes her own anger and leaves the box behind, unable to continue her scheme unchanged. Agency is clear and the closure choice alters tactics with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and drives the sequence. Escalation occurs through the breathing ritual and blood sacrifice, but the protagonist faces little opposition or narrowing dilemma; the dream "hesitates" and then folds inward without resistance. The cost (a slashed palm, three drops of blood) is visible but does not foreclose a live competing option or force a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (orchard survival after breach) is signaled early and clear. The mender's agency manifests in grafting and barring the elders, but escalation reads as a montage of accumulation (week of sleep, bees, buds) rather than a tightening choice that forecloses a live option. The breach and the elders' return frame external pressure, yet no on-page reversal tests the mender's commitment under immediate duress—she waits, the orchard blooms, and the elders are turned away in summary. Cost is present conceptually (ribbon rotting, vows composting) but remains oblique rather than viscerally felt in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake ("pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit her sanity page by page") is declared early but remains abstract—no on-page scene tests what "forfeit" means in immediate terms. The reversals (mirror opens to corridor, bathroom is chrysalis, she merges with the page) read as revelations delivered rather than pressure points that force trade-offs. The "every fruit she plucks erases a kindness" mechanic arrives mid-story and is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible price that alters tactics. Agency is passive reception; Mara experiences transformation rather than choosing between competing goods with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—retrieving unlearned lessons to prevent war—is declared but never tested by a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The cipher puzzle is solved via magical convenience (hybrid bud exhales the word) rather than protagonist agency or escalating pressure. The year Elara loses to unlock the door is narrated in one line without dramatized cost or altered tactics. No reversal or deepening forces a choice between competing goods; the time traveler's debt is "repaid" through summary without on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the scattered syllables of a name—is declared but never tested with visible cost or narrowed options. The protagonist follows the emerald card, gathers "heat-spots," recites fragments, and the name appears in the sky without struggle or trade-off. No on-page reversal alters tactics; coincidence (the card pulsing, the maze revealing panes) drives progression rather than agency. The sister's sigh at the end is labeled "voluntary" but arrives without prior refusal or tension that would make the shift legible. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: translate the absent village into a form time can hold. The frozen clock signals urgency, and Elara's task—braiding wax-soaked cord into village structures—provides a clear goal. One tightening: "With each tug, the frozen clock gears above her shivered," showing responsive pressure. Closure delivers: the clock resumes, the village is folded into time. Yet no reversal or complication tests Elara's commitment; she executes the ritual without error, adaptation, or trade-off. The cost is borne by history (the erased village), not by the protagonist on the page. No live option is foreclosed for her, no want conflicts with fear, and coincidence (the convenient arrival of seal and rope) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the maps and stories before the energy beings consume all sound—is signaled in the opening paragraphs and tightens when the ice augury reveals a one-hour bloom of hush. The mapkeeper's agency drives the escalation: she reads the ice, wraps the stone to prevent leakage, projects silence to pass the Warden, and completes the circle to sever sound pathways. The final act of laying the map on the altar and releasing the stone's voices forecloses the path of carrying the physical maps out, a visible trade-off, though the beings' defeat feels somewhat convenient once the circle closes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake—rekindling the lamp to prove pattern and meaning—is signaled early and sustained. The quest deepens when the shard of hush is found fused to the child's skeleton, and the desert falling mute shows immediate cost. The lamp igniting and voices heard constitute a tightening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting the opening question. However, the protagonist's path feels preordained by coincidence rather than constrained by choices that foreclose alternatives; luck (finding the skeleton, the shard's location) enables rather than complicates resolution. Escalation reads as thematic accumulation more than narrowing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve a singular archived self or accept fragmented, collective identity—is signaled early and tightens when solid fog arrives and one pellet strikes her temple, releasing a stranger's memory. The tiles' whisper ("Fragment is also form") provides the key reversal that narrows options and shifts her from paralysis to synthesis. Agency is renunciation and arrangement: she snaps the quill, gathers pellets, sculpts the figure, and descends, foreclosing archival purity. Cost is visible in the departure ("pockets empty") and the figure left behind as uncertain seed. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the piece delivers that when the whisper reframes the dilemma and she acts on it.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—piercing the imposed darkness to restore hope—is signaled early and holds through the ending. One meaningful tightening occurs when Luma must negotiate passage (the sentry confrontation) and secure the governor's consent, yet both obstacles resolve via convenient tools (silver dust, his unexplained curiosity) rather than protagonist-driven trade-offs. The rocket launch and sky-cracking constitute a decisive physical act, but the escalation lacks visible cost: Luma risks nothing tangible (her satchel is already empty, her promise to "join the sentries" never feels credible), and the resolution feels ordained rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation with the daughter—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once when the daughter arrives unbidden, then deepens when she takes the cicada with thumb-brushing contact. The brittle star becomes a living diagram of navigating pain, an on-page model that reweights tactics. Agency is present but muted: the chronicler's choice to shift the lantern and offer the cicada are gestures of invitation rather than high-cost decisions. The ending's resumed conversation and shared observation constitute Earned Stasis with felt cost (the awkwardness, the slow reweaving), meeting Accumulative escalation standards but lacking a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (collect silences vs. escape claustrophobia) is signaled early and deepens through the keeper trade and membrane passage. The piece tightens once: Lira chooses to release the silences rather than carry "the bunker inside her forever," forecloses the collection path, and descends transformed. The membrane passage ("stretched her skin until the contracted chambers of her heart unfolded") imposes felt cost. Agency is clear in the final choice. However, escalation relies more on symbolic accumulation than causal pressure; the keeper and membrane feel more like stations than obstacles that narrow options through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: teaching silence to comfort through the ritual transit and the commuter's confession. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via the storm glass cycle, the decibel spike (thirty, then twenty-six, then twenty-one), and Nilo's throttle adjustment that "teaches silence how to comfort by example." The commuter's spoken fear is a meaningful tightening that narrows options (the crystals seal it, the terrace steadies) with felt cost (confession at twenty-six decibels, lighter exit). Agency is clear: Nilo's choice to ease the throttle and the commuter's choice to speak. Minor weakness: the stakes remain primarily atmospheric; the cost of failure (turbulence? missed crossing?) is implied rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—reach the throne before sunrise—is declared but never tested; no obstacle, reversal, or tightening occurs. The protagonist encounters a locked door that opens immediately when she interfaces, climbs a spiral of light without effort, and sits on the throne as sunrise arrives on cue. Coincidence (the crown reassembles itself "atom by atom" in her pocket) resolves the central question. No agency-driven escalation, no visible cost, no trade-off between competing goods—only a passive ascent to an uncontested outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching the boy to cross over—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: the shadow keeper performs a familiar ritual without adaptation or setback, and the boy's resistance flickers but never forces a tactical shift. The ending reconfigures the keeper's understanding (suffocating as beginning, not ending) but the arrival of this insight feels passive, a gift rather than a choice under pressure. One meaningful deepening is present but lacks visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is restitution from pyramid-scheme debt; escalation proceeds via Lira's crawl to the drip line, slotting the bolt, and the chorus "squeeze harder" that narrows options to twisting or retreating. The bolt-shearing is a decisive physical act with visible cost (blood, years of pitches released). However, the multiversal mechanics—how twisting one bolt resets interest rates across dimensions—remain conceptually asserted rather than tactically tested. Lira's agency at the diamond-pitch beat is strong, but the prior volunteer-for-night-watch setup is told rather than shown forging the path to this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover and voice the dynasty's crime—is signaled early and tightens through the search, discovery, and playback sequence. The key escalation occurs when the handle snaps in Arin's palm, cutting skin and creating the blood-ink treaty that enables public confession; this is protagonist-driven and narrows options (cannot replay, must act now). The public witness at the window and the midnight garlands are outcomes, not additional turns, but the cost is unmistakable: name, dynasty, and personal safety sacrificed. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling the murmured allegiance to free the jester-king—is signaled early and drives the knight to the greenhouse. The central tightening occurs when the puppet offers the exchange, forcing a binary choice with irreversible consequences. The knight's agency manifests in the nodding assent and armor removal, though the decision feels more passive acceptance than active struggle. One meaningful reversal: understanding that capturing possibility requires becoming its abandoned vessel. Cost is visible (humanity traded for wooden form, eternal guardianship) and forecloses return. The lack of on-page resistance or internal debate before surrender limits tension at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: magnify one small kindness to prove the past not waste. The tightening occurs when Rowan finds the button (stuttered heart), reads dust, links it to Marcus, and commits the artifact to his file—each beat narrows options and raises emotional cost. Agency is clear: her decision to photograph, catalog under "Unknown, but breathing," and insert the note with "pursue if inquiry ever made" forecloses passivity and charges the ending. The cost is visible (night's solitary labor, emotional exposure) but remains quiet; a sharper trade-off would lift to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—broadcasting erased histories to counter systemic revision—is signaled early and drives Mira's actions. The plan unraveling at sunset when drones reappear creates one meaningful complication. However, escalation is thin: the drones pivot away on schedule without Mira adapting tactics under direct pressure, and the final confrontation (officers hesitating) arrives as a passive reception rather than a choice that narrows options. Cost is implied (hands raised, capture imminent) but not viscerally dramatized in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a live path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy to prevent it from naming the day of his death—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates as the prophecy pushes harder ("trying to speak its final clause"), and the saxophonist counters with increasingly precise musical tactics (diminished chord, trill, final soft note that "traveled backward"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vested hush buckles and he releases the erasure note. However, agency feels more like endurance than decisive choice; the protagonist reacts to the prophecy's advances rather than initiating turns that narrow his own options. The cost—knowing he must return tomorrow—is stated but not dramatized as a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring equilibrium by remembering forgotten things—is signaled early and frames the monument-building project. Mireya's decision to build monuments and release the moonstone shows agency, but the escalation is additive (more monuments) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The moonstone burst and sky-parting resolution feel rewarded rather than earned through a trade-off; no visible price or loss accompanies the climax. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens texture but does not reweight the stake with felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to trust uncertainty over certainty—is signaled by "uncertainly certain" in the opening and sharpens when the leaf spiral points to the cellar. The waterfall descent and pool immersion narrow options: Elias must choose to leave the artifacts or reclaim them, and his decision forecloses the tinkering path with visible cost (locking the shop, sign reading "Out Tinkering Indefinitely"). The agency is clear—wade in, align the artifacts, leave them—and the cost is felt in the final image of clocks frozen and the admiral legend. However, the escalation is more textural deepening than causal tightening, and the "years later" sailors' legend introduces new material without dramatizing Elias's intervening struggle, which slightly dilutes the earned feel of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the brother's name through alchemical mending—is signaled early and pursued across the ritual. The four "limits" structure sequences beats, but they feel exploratory rather than escalating; each transmutation succeeds without friction or price that alters subsequent tactics. The final decision to join the search and "teach the others" reframes stakes conceptually, yet no on-page cost (lost material, failed attempt, renounced path) makes the shift legible as sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—collecting the child's giggle to heal his fractured soul—is signaled early. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating: Elara steps, reaches, climbs, and speaks without meaningful resistance or a choice that narrows options. The giggle's pause and approach feel like inevitable outcomes of the ritual rather than a turn driven by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid; the tooth and giggle dissolve into warm saltwater that "smelled of pine and birthday cake," a sensory detail that names comfort rather than cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient, but the final beat does not reweight prior material with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discover the mathematics of mercy—is declared early and drives every beat. The three equations accumulate pressure and narrow options: pain = memory × resistance, mercy asymptotic, mercy = pain/(memory+1). The strap removal is a concrete tightening that forecloses the path of self-flagellation. Cost is visible: "one step closer…one decimal nearer to zero suffering" accepts that forgiveness is a limit, not a destination. Under the Accumulative lens, this qualifies as escalation through density and cadence shift. The interrogator remains off-page, so external conflict is minimal; the protagonist's struggle is entirely internal, which fits the design but limits friction.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories by returning the fragment) is signaled early and tightens when the narrator steps through the painting to face boy-self. One meaningful pressure point: the exchange forecloses the adult's possession with cost ("exhaling a life"). The resolution hinges on protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. However, the market scenario and the painting's mechanics arrive without prior constraint or complication; the narrator encounters no opposition or trade-off before the climactic choice, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue fixing elevators or choose ascent—is signaled early through the ghosts' silent question: "Why do you still fix what climbs when you can see what falls?" Pressure deepens when she discovers the temporal loop and understands the ghosts haunt her moment of decision. Her agency is renunciation with visible cost: leaving the barrel untouched forecloses the repair path and commits her to uncertainty. The tightening is meaningful under the Accumulative lens: the loop closes "like a blade snapping into a utility knife," and her choice to take the ticket and walk out narrows options with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: compress eternity via the bottled whisper to repair Corwin's "empty spaces." One tightening: uncorking the whisper destabilizes the library, glass cracks, the orrery warps—options narrow from "perfect system" to rupture-invitation. Yet Corwin's agency is passive reception; he laughs "soundless" and steps through glass without weighing a trade-off or renouncing an alternative path. The mirror-keeper's warning ("Compress eternity and the sky will notice") sets up cost, but no visible price is paid—no injury, forfeited ability, or relationship severed on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens shows density increase but lacks a dramatized choice that forecloses a live option with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reimagining a civilization through the shard—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archaeologist arrives and Aurelia must choose between surrender and destruction, but that choice is resolved by crushing the shard, which then creates a convenient new crystal rather than foreclosing a path with visible loss. The storm-covering sequence demonstrates agency and method, but the final act bypasses true cost: dissolution replaces decision, and the new crystal and archaeologist's conversion soften the price. Escalation is present but the ending distributes reward rather than exacting sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaim light stolen by midnight—is signaled early. Elias's confession provides one meaningful tightening that enables the resolution, and the cost (speaking his unvarnished self, relinquishing the chip, finishing the lullaby) is legible. However, escalation is minimal: he enters with the solution and faces a single test (honesty) that he passes without complication or reversal. No live options are foreclosed mid-story; the covenant accepts his truth in one beat, and the orrery unfurls without further resistance. The resolution feels pre-determined rather than earned through protagonist agency under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: locating the place where explanations fail, signaled in paragraph four and sustained through the delve. The compass discovery and psychometry vision narrow her options, compelling descent. Escalation is textural: air warms, the compass yanks her forward, the lagoon's single ripple "disobeyed the stillness." The climactic choice—uncorking every vial—emerges from the protagonist's agency and the lagoon's implicit demand. Cost clarity is present but oblique: she releases decades of collected scent and receives "possibility unmoored" in return, yet the tradeoff (what she loses by becoming hinge rather than collector) remains more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision shows her own hand letting go, a gesture she "had not yet performed."

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: decide whether the slide is gift or geas, resolved when Maela understands the archway as ledger and carves the fleet into permanence. Storm escalates sensory pressure; the slide's spiral rotation and shadow-fleet projection tighten options until she must carve "with the wood's memory." The final act—setting the miniature on the tidal line, rowing outward, drowning GPS—forecloses return to satellite navigation with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the slide dissolved into the sculpture," making the choice irreversible. Agency reads as attention and endurance more than decision conflict, capping higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding why flowers bloom at night. The piece deepens through seasonal accumulation (autumn → winter → thaw → bloom) and Liora's artistic experiments (pinning postcards, arranging branches, painting panes), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options with visible cost. The moonflowers opening and her departure west feel like lyric fulfillment rather than earned escalation. Agency is present (she paints, waits, walks away) but the pressure remains internal and abstract; no external constraint tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—unearthing suppressed testimony—is signaled early and tightens when Mireya must trade her own future milestones for pages. The parley escalates through iterative offerings, each costing a personal tomorrow, culminating in the mother's confession and the broadcast choice. Agency is clear: she arranges the grammar, accepts encoded memory, and chooses to read aloud over the capital. The cost is visible ("years rearrange inside me, futures closing") and forecloses the path of silence. One causal reversal when the final page reveals betrayal, forcing the broadcast decision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—conceiving a new Cove that rejects resurrection myths—is signaled early and tightens when the amber bottle "vibrates, hungry" for the scrolls, forcing the alchemist to choose refusal over comfort. That pivot narrows options (no bottled preservation) and introduces visible cost: perpetual solitary labor, monthly burnings, and the risk that wind scatters memory unwitnessed. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and a single decisive pattern break (burying the bottle) that reweights the project with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: suppress or archive the accidental prophecy. The immersion choice tightens by triggering the child-memory, which reveals the prophecy's inevitability and personal cost. However, the escalation is passive—prophecy "kept changing," quinces "bore faces," foghorn "migrated into him"—without Ambrose making a second decision that narrows live options. The final act (writing the word, speaking the prophecy aloud) feels like acceptance rather than a choice with visible alternatives, landing the piece in mid-6s for escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: reopen linear time by decreasing entropy to save possibility itself. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex awakens and she must act; the choice to split the bead (circulation vs. preservation/surrender) narrows options and forecloses the path of simple release. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure—obstacles (frozen atrium, vortex spin) yield without visible struggle or tactical cost. The final act carries conceptual weight but lacks a dramatized tradeoff or visible price paid on the page that would push this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to honor the municipal timer or answer the mountain's whisper—is signaled early and tightens at 03:59 when Mara presses the switch, forecloses the siren option, and accepts the cost of city bewilderment and potential civil-defense anger. The barometer's two-millibar drop at 03:17 escalates pressure causally, forcing her to interpret the rope's tug as the mountain's voice. Agency is clear: she climbs the belfry, splices the servo, and chooses bronze over steel. The resolution is earned by her prior vow to favor listening over noise, and the cost is legible—villages wake in wonder, radios crackle, her station's protocol is altered. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "tracking microclimate variations was never about prediction but about courtesy."

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding connection or meaning in the overlooked era—is signaled early and accumulates through the nightly empathy practice. The vision sequence provides one meaningful deepening that reweights the janitor's grief into actionable understanding, and the final choice to leave the dome open and walk away forecloses the path of passive tending. Yet the escalation is largely internal and receptive; the meteor's question arrives as catalyst rather than protagonist-driven turn, and the price paid (abandoning the lantern, leaving the station) feels more symbolic than tactically constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve the ghosts' unspoken words and prevent their dissolution. The child's arrival and the box's fracture tighten pressure in one meaningful beat, forcing Alden's choice between mending (risking final breaking) and abandonment (scattering the words). The dream sequence narrates rather than dramatizes the escalation of consequence. The final act—pressing the fracture and whispering—shows agency and forecloses the path of silence with visible cost (his vow broken, permanent station accepted), but the cost feels more stated than felt under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding time's texture in a post-numerical world. Pressure accumulates through textural discoveries (motes, light, metallic taste) and deepens when the timekeeper encounters the garage sale tradition—others have already begun the work he seeks. The trade of the urn fragment narrows his stance from passive collector to active participant, and the woman's footsteps "typing Braille against his sternum" registers as felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the sale encounter) reweights his solitary quest. However, agency leans observational; the coincidental discovery of the time capsule and the fortuitous arrival of the teen with a sale reduce protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and sustained. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options under pressure. The woman's arrival and the shared performance with the zither are additions rather than complications; the poet's internal stance does not shift in response to opposition or cost. The spiral's dissolution by tide is a natural consequence, not a choice that forecloses a path. Escalation reads as accretion of images rather than mounting pressure that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—foster interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and drives all moves. Escalation accumulates through wire wrapping (seven branches by twilight), bat acceptance, fox witnessing, tourist participation, culminating in the final copper junction and chime. One tightening: the diary-page-as-conductor literalizes the pulse transfer and forecloses Mara's presence. Minor friction: the foxes and bats consent too easily; no species resists or complicates, flattening potential conflict. Cost is visible (Mara departs, leaves the diary, footprints reabsorbed) but the orchard's success feels guaranteed rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove return is reaction, not reunion. Pressure accumulates through the amber's pulse, tower hum, and spore inhalation, culminating in the vision that tests her hypothesis. One meaningful tightening: the vision forces her to experience homecoming as chemistry, which she then acts on by planting the shard and walking away. The tower's collapse adds urgency but feels externally imposed rather than driven by her choice. Cost is conceptual (she stops chasing home) but the path literally erasing behind her reads slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is clear: to let a garden reclaim the battlefield by fertilizing it with ancient stories and seed pods. Pressure accumulates through the ritual steps—speaking to the gull, opening the box, scattering seeds, speaking dead languages—culminating in the blossoming vines and treaty fulfillment. However, the escalation is largely procedural; the coachman encounters no meaningful resistance or trade-off that narrows his options. The "voice cracking" and "living tongue bled" arrive as cost markers, but they don't alter his tactics or force a choice between competing goods. The ritual succeeds as planned, and the final decision ("never carry weapons again") feels more like a declaration than a forfeiture shaped by on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (find the brother, translate distance into closeness) is signaled early and tightens when the cylinder riddle forces Scraps and Kite to decode coordinates. One meaningful reversal: the leaf itself solves the riddle, enabling the journey. The brother's rescue carries conceptual cost (the leaf must be relinquished at closure) but the escalation relies on off-page scent-map pressure rather than on-page choices that narrow live options during the journey itself.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: honor Mother's ritual vs. survive grief alone. The hatch discovery and compass spin provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Kael's choice to crawl inside and take Mother's hand is protagonist-driven. The piece lacks a visible trade-off at the moment of decision—does he hesitate, knowing he might never return? The escalation is present but the cost legibility at closure (what exactly does he give up?) remains oblique. Agency is clear; price needed one more line to crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—passing wonder/apprenticeship—signals early and tightens when Vespers swaps the bishop, yet that swap introduces the solution (fall upward) rather than narrowing options through prior constraint. Halcyon's acceptance of the shadow stair escalates pressure, but his choice feels prompted by Vespers's invitation more than by his own foreclosed alternatives. The descent and handoff deepen the theme but do not add a second reversal or price that alters Vespers's tactics. One meaningful pressure point is present (the match climax), meeting the length minimum, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory before the next king "rewrites" history—signals early and tightens once when Kestrel's patrol forces Mara to choose collaboration over solitary archiving. However, the escalation lacks a second reversal or visible loss; Kestrel's immediate acquiescence ("Tell me the name of the maid") deflates the pressure his rifle promised. The story opts for lyric deepening over causal tightening, which fits the Accumulative lens but leaves the final image's cost more implied than dramatized. Agency exists in Mara's choice to share the method, but the foreclosed path (solitary control) is not charged with sufficient on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaim buried talents to understand home's shape without becoming a weapon again) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the custodian demands she replant talents in exchange for the stone, forcing a trade-off between reclaiming memory and expanding his cage. Her refusal—cracking her reflection with the quill—demonstrates protagonist agency that narrows options with visible cost (she destroys her mirror-scrying gift on the page). The custodian's shadow-following and shelf-rearranging provide coherent escalating pressure under a causal lens. Cost is legible: she seals all talents permanently, choosing release over power.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is self-forgiveness, signaled early ("winnow guilt from memory") and sustained. Pressure tightens when Marek decodes the suicidal king-walk in the tapestry and realizes "forgiveness was not forgetting but reframing the game so the loss became instructive rather than definitive." The climactic choice is his decision to walk the physical maze ("the only way out was to step forward, not solve") and right the fallen king—an act that costs him the safety of exile and circling regret. The agency is renunciation and acceptance with visible consequence: time resumes, he pockets the king, and walks toward possible reconciliation without guarantee. One deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—scattering blame to escape singular guilt—is signaled early and tightens once when Lira realizes "the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening," forcing a tactic shift with visible cost (she stops reciting, absorbs all prior echoes, presses forehead to spire). That turn is protagonist-driven and narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The arrival of priests adds time pressure but remains off-page. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost (walking away from the ritual, shadow doubled by echo, painting with her own blood) is legible and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to press the charm and risk the workshop sinking to heal the statue—is signaled early and tightens through the chain countdown, creating coherent escalation under a Causal lens. Lira's final choice to proceed despite terror forecloses survival with on-page cost (the workshop slides into the sea, the rebreather floods). The reversal when "meaning had answered" but "meaning was not mercy" narrows her options to a forced trade-off. Minor issue: the internal conflict between "salvation and suicide" is told rather than enacted through micro-choices in prior beats; the decision arrives abruptly at chain four without visible intermediate wavering that would deepen the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve the quay before demolition) is signaled at line one and tightens through escalation: mirror cracks erasing the harbor → discovery of the impossible shell → copying under plankton light → recognizing himself as perpetual figure → wedging the offering in the fissure. The deepening is accumulative under the Textural lens: each discovery narrows options from painting the real quay to copying an eternal miniature to hiding it beyond reach. Cost is visible: he leaves with empty hands, sells the cracked mirror, and renounces human witness. The shell's advance ("the figure was himself…perpetually arriving, perpetually leaving") raises existential stakes without requiring a set-piece confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (proving whispers can guide ships) is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: the protagonist performs a premeditated ritual without meaningful opposition, reversal, or cost that forecloses a live option. The boat's course change at the end feels coincidental rather than earned by her agency. The claimed cost—her mother's disappearance, ongoing grief—is backstory rather than an on-page price paid during this ritual. Under the accumulative lens, the piece layers atmosphere but does not deepen or tighten pressure through a credible turn.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: to navigate back to lost places and people. The ritual structure provides a clear sequence of escalating moves (lay spiral, solder hair, speak names, step into center), and the phone calls impose external pressure at timed intervals. However, each step feels additive rather than tightening—no step forecloses a prior option or forces a visible trade-off until the final dissolution, which arrives as inevitable rather than chosen under competing pressures. The cost at closure is legible (bodily dissolution, becoming offering) but lacks a moment where she weighs what she's losing against what she's reclaiming. Agency reads more as ritual compliance than decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a cure versus bearing communal pain—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of the glass eye, preparation of the mixture, and the voice's challenge. The spilled mixture forces escalation; the luminous film rising to "occlude nothing, revealing everything" crystallizes the choice. Agency is clear: the protagonist's decision to drink "to carry them more gently" forecloses the path of erasure with visible cost (accepting the congregation's presence). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens; the textbook's warning about consent to be witnessed raises stakes before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture to break the borrowed-memory cycle—is signaled early and tightens through the three gaps Maris catalogs. Her agency peaks in the descent and release: she chooses to pay with her own memories, a visible cost (mother's song, first ship's horn) that forecloses the loop. The gaps closing in sequence (gulls, ferry, reflection) demonstrate consequence. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens and the final act reweights her isolation from haunted to "cleaner."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—choosing one's true path versus inherited duty—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ants and glowing chip provide escalation cues, but the peak choice lacks a visible tradeoff: Elias hesitates briefly, then steps through without dramatized loss or renunciation. The piece offers one tightening (discovery → following → arrival), but the cost at closure is asserted ("welcoming the new") rather than paid in a concrete on-page action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—prevent kingdom from forgetting her name—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the climb and pooling starlight, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency under the inferred Accumulative lens. The queen's final choice (step onto dais, accept crown) is a renunciation with conceptual cost, yet the turn lacks a visible trade-off or live option foreclosed on the page. Coincidence (dream-loop mechanics) complicates but does not resolve, fitting Accumulative mode, though one meaningful deepening via protagonist decision is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: Corin's choice between commodifying moments (pocket-suns as "holes where moments should be") and releasing presence. The confession to Mira and the crushing of the pocket-sun are protagonist-driven acts with visible cost—he forfeits his product and its market. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira returns the shell "with her warmth, her breath, the salt of her tears," reweighting the spiral's meaning. However, the turn from confession to crushing happens rapidly without a visible escalation beat that tests Corin's resolve under new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether to continue chronicling or surrender to the recursive dream-wheel. The scroll's instruction "do not land; landing confirms the ending" tightens the tension between flight and bodily constraint. Her choice to lay the scroll in snow and watch it erase, then return inside to "keep chronicling," forecloses escape with felt cost (clinging to spokes, splinters in palms). One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees her own footprints not yet made, collapsing prophecy and memory into one pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning after sensory loss) is signaled early and tightens through Mira's deepening engagement with the screw. One meaningful turn: her realization that the screw was "offered, a metallic prayer" reconfigures her stance. Agency is renunciation/endurance (she will not smell again) paired with a gained capacity (to midwife stories). Cost is legible (she accepts permanent loss), though the pressure accumulates largely through reflection rather than on-page choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into stories by completing the rune before the kettle's plume—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Lina holds her breath (crystallizing it painfully) while racing the kettle's steam, and the twelfth stroke seals with an audible click that shatters the crystallized air into motes. The resolution is earned by her agency (completing the stroke, speaking the name) with visible cost (split quill, the platform rising as weight lifts). The youthful superstition functions as both constraint and method, lending causal pressure. Slight hedge: the typhoon's arrival "the instant her lungs refilled" reads as convenience timing rather than strictly causal, though it does not resolve the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnect with the exorcised sister—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the induced current guides the exorcist's hand, and escalation peaks when the ghost materializes and asks "Was any of it heard?" The exorcist's agency is decision (speaking the apology aloud) and renunciation (releasing the perfume drop, leaving the bottle in the folder). However, the sister's cooperative forgiveness reduces friction; no live option is truly foreclosed with visible cost. The chainsaws provide external pressure but do not complicate the protagonist's internal calculus in a way that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"unravel cosmic illusions"—is declared but never tested by a reversal or forced trade-off. No tightening: the witness proceeds through each station (opening dictionary, walking spiral, kneeling) without opposition or cost that narrows options. The "final walk" sequence asserts deepening but dramatizes no agency, renunciation, or price. Coincidence (the hiccup, the self-shelving library) drives all movement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces on-page resistance or trade-off. Water flowing uphill offers a single reversal, but Torvald responds with contemplation rather than agency-driven escalation. The final act (turning the key counterclockwise) is a decision, but its cost is conceptual and asserted ("feeling... like coming home") rather than dramatized as forfeiture or narrowed options. No meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens occurs; the piece accumulates images without pressure intensification or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding her father without forgiving him, signaled early. The diary discovery is a meaningful tightening that forces Mira to see his love beneath the gambling wreckage, narrowing her refusal. Her final subway loop and page-leaving ritual demonstrate agency—she chooses risk over escape—but the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; no live option is dramatized as foreclosed on the page. The cost (releasing anger, accepting ambiguity) is legible in the final image ("not lighter, but wider"), meeting the Accumulative lens requirement for one deepening with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (breaking the cultivated loop vs. remaining in it) is signaled early and tightens when the child asks to meet. The protagonist's agency—handing over the disc, clipping the wires, stepping onto the track bed—drives the ending with visible cost (the booth goes silent, the emergency call unanswered). One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman reveals her identity and the gate opens, forcing the protagonist to choose between following and staying. The emergency phone ringing for the first time introduces a secondary pressure that the protagonist refuses, forecloses a path, and charges the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve the jetty's memory before demolition. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when security arrives and the archivist must finish and hide the tube, then a second deepening when she chooses to seal the locket itself inside. Agency is clear: her decision to relocate the locket forecloses its personal function with visible cost. The boy's drowning history and her daughter's parallel age create moral weight. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is density increase and cadence shift; the final act (playing waltz with daughter, tube's strap on the music stand) reweights the opening archival mission.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (curing loneliness through reciprocity) is signaled early. The key tightening is Lila's arrival and the seed-doubling, which draws pilgrims and transforms the station. However, escalation is largely elliptical: "word spread," "pilgrims arrived," "one autumn dusk" compress the pressure rather than dramatizing it. Kit's agency at the end (boarding the train) feels dictated by thematic necessity ("the teller must leave") rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The price of leaving is stated, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to draft unmapped emotions at the stillpoint. The trail of musical notes tightens into a spiral, forcing inhalation and kneeling—a meaningful deepening rather than a causal reversal. The protagonist's agency is present (he walks, inhales, traces) but largely receptive; coincidence does not resolve, yet the forest "guides" and the stillpoint "accepts" without on-page resistance. Cost is visible (ring empties, clearing seals, he memorizes rather than prints), and the final walk composes a new melody. One persistent constraint (blindness and reliance on skin/ring/cane) shapes all tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (thresh meaning from garbled signals, repair the wrong-seed mistake) is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the anomaly has scrambled causality ("effect sometimes arrived before cause"). One clear tightening: the child's laughter dated tomorrow forces immediate action. The unbending edit forecloses the path of passive interpretation—she commits to active history-editing with visible cost (power drain, floating, future loops). The piece leans Accumulative/Textural, so escalation reads as density increase and conceptual reweighting rather than causal narrowing. Mild penalty: the reversal from "wrong seeds" to "merely early" arrives more as realization than as a decision that closes off another live option; the anomaly's cooperation (easing "like a sigh") softens the struggle and reduces felt resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music for the town—is signaled early and pursued through the advisor's counterclockwise mapping. The pressure accumulates via the subtractive sequence (cleat, generator, heartbeat) and culminates in the harbor's note. However, escalation is largely textural: each deletion is described as making "the world grow lighter" without an on-page cost or obstacle that narrows the advisor's options. The boy and old woman feel relief, but these are passive effects rather than protagonist-driven turns. The advisor's final gesture succeeds without visible trade-off or failure, rendering the stakes abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the lack of felt price or friction lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing her grandmother's promise—is declared early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page obstacle tests Ember's commitment; she descends, finds the fragment, translates it, and ascends without reversal or tightening. The revelation ("fire remembers," reweaving threads) is given to her rather than earned through a choice that forecloses another path. Coincidence (the archive collapses exactly when she exits) resolves the sequence without protagonist agency or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: reclaim enough internal space to "breathe her own dream" vs. the chorus of grafted memories. The lagoon immersion narrows options—she wades deeper despite memory-threads trying to anchor her—and the drumming accelerates pressure. However, the resolution (slowing tempo, inviting harmony) is not forced by a reversal or visible price; Mira shifts strategy after a realization ("tender accountability") that arrives as epiphany rather than through a dramatized failure or trade-off. The cost—what she loses by choosing harmony over erasure—is stated ("weary smile") but not shown in a concrete forfeiture or consequence that alters her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the whisper network's existence—is declared late and remains abstract; no on-page cost or trade-off tests commitment. The stranger's arrival complicates Mira's routine, but escalation is minimal: they walk, reach the panel, speak three words, and the door opens without struggle or sacrifice. The "calculated spontaneity" tone implies rising pressure, yet the stranger's key and knowledge arrive as convenient solutions rather than earned reversals. Agency is mostly observational; Mira's map-reading and the stranger's coin placement are acts of revelation, not choice under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: teaching darkness its forgotten worth. The piece deepens once—shutters into water, mirror-angling, spiral brightening—and the darkness shifts from eraser to ember-carrier, a meaningful tightening. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than agonistic; no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The protagonist's agency is enactment without visible friction or cost that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens but remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts" as a rebellion against "fixed games"—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the gathering and confessions, but no on-page reversal tightens Mara's options: she encounters no resistance, no curfew enforcement, no rival interpretation of the grotto's purpose. The sapling's roots entwining with the grotto's iron trees is a lyric deepening, yet the stakes remain conceptual. Mara's agency is orchestration without visible tradeoff; coincidence (everyone arrives drawn by "the hush") facilitates rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the island and its people will vanish into the sea or find a new form—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes "the island would only stay for those who chose its next shape." Her sung declaration and the community's choice to push the fragments into a raft spiral narrows options and forecloses the path of decay. The whale's arrival complicates rather than resolves, and Lira's agency (singing, releasing the scrimshaw) drives the turn with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: cultivating lightness in grief under silence ordinance. Pressure tightens when the crow speaks, the performer answers with the wooden feather (small rebellion), and the officer joins. The planting of bare stems with empty-can narration forces the sky's single tear—a meaningful deepening that narrows options (performance suspended, guilt acknowledged as weight). Agency is clear in the whittling, the crow exchange, and the final log entry. Cost is legible: the performer renounces blank-faced safety for visible sedition, and the officer pockets his badge.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rewrite boundary law through poetic paraphrase. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening occurs when "None shall pass" becomes "None shall stay," altering the decree's semantic charge. However, the protagonist faces no live opposition or trade-off—her boots touch water "that had forgotten how to be solid" without on-page cost (stamina, social consequence, or risk of error). The stated risk of mispronunciation never materializes as a near-miss or tactical pivot, leaving escalation asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Milo's search for a hue he's never seen—is signaled early and deepens when the marble eye reveals "the violence of color." One meaningful tightening occurs: the glass-smashing collaboration (line 15) forecloses perfection and commits both characters to brokenness as beauty. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens; cost is legible in the renunciation of painting and the deliberate destruction of their creations. No antagonist or second reversal is required at this length; the spiral garden closure reweights prior moves with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering "texture of connection"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. The collectors' shift from preservation to creation occurs in a single paragraph without reversal, narrowing of options, or visible price paid. The bell ringer's question "propels" change via declaration, not agency under pressure. No escalation: the laboratory "seemed to listen," then the collectors "began to dismantle," all summarized rather than dramatized with competing impulses or forfeited paths.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—accepting transformation versus freezing memory—is signaled early but never tested through on-page reversal or narrowing choice. Placing origami figures is iterative work without escalation; no figure triggers a cost or alters her tactics. The decision to leave is declared in summary without visible trade-off. Coincidence (the coordinates "matched perfectly," the curtains "began to glow") facilitates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping the cultural pattern of collapse before witnesses forget—is signaled in paragraph four and pursued through escalating technical moves: grid layout, vector assignment, barefoot data-printing, atmospheric adjustment, timeline multiplication. The discovery of the leveraged-debt fractal at the card intersection is a meaningful tightening that narrows her hypothesis and forces the final reconfiguration. However, the escalation reads more as methodical accumulation than rising pressure with tradeoffs; no live option is visibly foreclosed until the sealing of the tin, and the cost (her prophecy unheard, her role as ghost for the next inheritor) is conceptual rather than a felt forfeiture that alters her immediate condition. Under the Accumulative lens this is acceptable, but the stakes remain cerebral throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—purifying the archive—is signaled early but never tested; no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options. Pressure is asserted ("the task felt like trying to hold starlight") but never dramatized through escalation. The shift from lone quest to community teaching happens off-page in summary; no visible price is paid, no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: preserving the unshareable shape of hope. The story signals this early and sustains pressure through symbolic accumulation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone metamorphoses and Mira realizes her mother's choice, narrowing her options to either dropping it or internalizing it—she chooses the latter with visible cost (career ended, self transformed). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the escalation reads as density increase and pattern break that reweights the stake. Agency is clear: Mira's choice to internalize the stone forecloses her path as a dusk noticer and transforms her into an afterimage. The cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing her creed without abandoning the last survivor—is signaled early and tightens through the shedding ritual, which forecloses her former identity step by step. The pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each discarded layer (ring, braid, lecture, tail-tip fragments) narrows options and raises emotional cost. The final choice to open the cage and leave it on the ground crystallizes her new stance with visible consequence: professional loss balanced against ethical integrity. The cost is legible and felt in the empty cage and dismantled reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—releasing the displaced miracle and achieving closure on the sister's death—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the miracle demands "Trade requires fresh loss," forcing the protagonist to reopen the wound with visible cost (blood as apology, scar splitting). Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to "give you back" and performs the reopening. The escalation under the Accumulative lens works through density increase (coffee rings → tunnel → underground jar → rising miracle → seed), and the cost is legible on the page. No second reversal is needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: recover the lost lyrics/message from her mother. One meaningful pressure point occurs when the film strip "suddenly moved of its own accord," threading itself—a reversal that narrows Mara's agency. The ending offers a stance shift (from seeking storage to accepting circulation) but the tightening is conceptual rather than tactical; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The coincidental provision of the complete letter and the cigarette case's discovery resolve the problem without Mara's prior struggle shaping the outcome. Cost is claimed ("envelope ashes") but the price feels decorative rather than dramatized in a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity before it calcifies—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when the aurora descends and the protagonist must dismantle the instrument, then deepens when she lies inside the design and the past/future fold into the present. The final act (dissolution into light) reweights the cost: her body becomes the medium, a permanent rest that enables ongoing transmission. However, the protagonist's agency is more ritual enactment than decision under conflicting options; she never seriously considers refusing or altering the path, which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: cultivate the sparks so lost cargo (children's dreams/lullabies) can travel again. The stake is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pollen children breathe in the sparks and the guard recognizes his directive is complete. Agency reads as ritual execution rather than decision under competing pressure; the guard performs without hesitation or tradeoff. The cost—coat lighter, sparks transferred—is visible but muted; no live option is foreclosed, and the resolution feels predetermined by the guard's training rather than a choice that narrows his future. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through density and charged imagery, meeting the sufficient standard for this length, though higher bands require a felt price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the mind's frontier—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when the jaguar demands she give away "the thing that keeps you rooted," forcing the gear drop, yet this choice lacks visible cost because the outcome (tree-becoming) reads as fulfillment rather than trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency is undermined by passive transformation ("cyclone of leaves and numbers, lifting her"). The escalation is conceptual (unraveling self) without tactical friction or a live price altering her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the guardian to balance the crossing—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: the guides walk, hear a howl, find the hound, and resolve the problem in a single gesture (the star stamp). No live options are foreclosed on the page, and the hound's internal shift ("courage she'd sought outside herself had been within all along") is summary rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. The "indirect routes" complicate the journey but do not force a trade-off or meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety paid in voices—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the boy's arrival and surgery, narrowing to the moment of the bolt transfer and the surgeon's "not yet." The bellhop's agency is largely observational; his one active choice (pressing the bolt into the boy's palm) occurs in backstory summary rather than present-scene dramatization. The ending deepens rather than tightens: the fortress's "microscopic fracture" and the boy's future ascent project forward without an on-page decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender to restore cosmic balance—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pretender opens the codex and the titan descends to whisper the second clue, narrowing the path to the sundering. The ink pellet touching skin and awakening the rune of drift provides a clear escalation beat. However, the resolution is frictionless: guards burst in but the titan "merely lifted his palm" and the droplet obeys; no cost, hesitation, or trade-off appears on the page. The pretender's glamour unravels "gentle yet absolute," and the titan walks away "already forgetting the man's face"—a declared mercy rather than a felt price that alters his later options.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (discovering the hidden path) signals early and tightens once through the dive decision. The summons ("assembly of clues") compels rather than forces a trade-off; Mira's agency is more receptive than conflicted. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hologram reframes her role, narrowing understanding from documentation to memory-stewardship. The cost is conceptual (sealing the page, accepting the vigil) and legible but not a visible sacrifice of a live alternative. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but modest; no major reversal tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reigniting the rebellion and reopening the sky—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates as the stargazer moves from observation to action: whistle → hum → climb → ignition. However, escalation lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that forecloses options; each step succeeds without resistance or cost until the shuttle simply works. The "rebellion's lull" as background context never directly opposes her; no militia intervenes, no shuttle fails, no choice forces a trade-off. The final broadcast is an achievement, but without on-page friction or a visible price paid during the climb to closure, the conflict remains one-directional.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (scramble the council's genetic program to grow a curious, stubborn child) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful pressure point: the guard's arrival forces the moss-bloom tactic and accelerates the grafting sequence. Agency is clear (Nara's choice to alter the embryo, accept the risk) and the cost is on-page (physical pain, concealment, future vulnerability). The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; the moss pollen resolves the guard threat slightly too easily, capping the band at high-7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"anchor optimism in realism"—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the somatic-mapping ritual tested against escalating grief. One meaningful deepening: the narrator moves from carrying the photo as ticket to releasing it, a choice that forecloses the daily unfolding with visible cost. Agency is renunciation with on-page price (the photograph rips away). Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and final covenant reweight options. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single tightening is sufficient and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—painting a face that no longer exists, completing the "redesign"—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through environmental tightening (walls closing, shelves collapsing) and the fragmentary tarot reconstruction. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; Elian's agency reads as following a symbolic script rather than forcing trade-offs with visible alternatives. The final step through the mirror forecloses life but the cost feels conceptual rather than dramatically tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—find Lyra and understand time's slowdown—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through discovered clues (bootprint, journal, ink portal), but no on-page reversal or tightening forces Kael into a trade-off. The journal revelation that Lyra "chose to disappear" should narrow options or raise cost; instead Kael immediately decides to follow without visible friction or price. The ending asserts "they had discovered" without dramatizing the moment of choice or its consequence, flattening escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to release contraband truths that expose the council's lies—is signaled early and coheres through the upload decision. Pressure tightens meaningfully when Sera recognizes "the council could re-freeze her and scrub this hour," narrowing her window, and her agency (coupling the transmitter, locking the hatch) drives the escalation under the Causal lens. The cost is legible: she provokes a response that may destroy the archive she loves, and she seals herself back into suspension not knowing if the library will survive. One friction: the tremor of guilt ("might provoke... ignite mobs who would burn books") arrives after the irreversible act, reducing its force as a complicating pressure during the choice itself. The coincidence of "distant explosions" and emergency lights appearing almost instantly after upload feels like external plot convenience rather than protagonist-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mira must reconcile her pacifist philosophy with her father's violent legacy through her garden work. Pressure accumulates through the night's grafting labor, each rose bearing "the weight of continuity." One meaningful tightening occurs when she weaves the sandbag scrap into stems, transforming her father's artifact into living memorial. Agency is present but contemplative; the final planting demonstrates endurance and acceptance rather than a choice between competing live options. The cost is legible (accepting all threads, violent and peaceful) but more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—catching the echo of the goddess—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates when the star-goddess demands Mara's cry or threatens to burn the garden, and Mara's response (driving the spike, voicing silence) narrows her options and transforms the hunt into a conversation. The cost is visible: she traps the echo only to "release herself into it," forecloses the path of capture, and accepts a new relationship with divinity. One meaningful tightening (the goddess's ultimatum and Mara's counter-move) suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—breaking the orbit of inherited regret—is signaled early and tightens through the proof-by-contradiction sequence. Each inscribed line narrows options: "If regret returns forever, then truth never changes" forces a collision with contradictory evidence. The ellipse cracking and the nib splintering constitute a visible cost that forecloses the old orbit. Agency is clear: Cordelia's writing and final refusal of the steel nib demonstrate renunciation with on-page consequence. One meaningful escalation (the orbit "shuddered" then "flared white") drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: silence the guilt-static and complete the unfinished lullaby. Pressure accumulates through the console interaction, the menu choices, and the realization that the lab "cultivated" guilt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the letters wrap her wrists, "tethering her to the console, to the guilt," forcing the final choice. However, agency is diffuse—she selects RESTORE, then RELEASE, but the narrative mode treats these as symbolic gestures rather than decisions with visible tradeoffs or foreclosed paths. The cost at closure (amber now empty, collarbone quiet) is conceptual and imagistic rather than a felt price paid through struggle. Escalation reads more as accumulative density than narrowing options under protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (discover meaning in the mess after erasing her life's work) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The mandala ritual is Mira's active attempt; the tile flake's final whisper and her decision to scatter the mandala constitute one meaningful tightening that forecloses permanence and commits her to iterative creation. Agency is present in the scattering gesture—a refusal of eternity—but the escalation reads more as accumulative intensity (thickening hush, vibrating flake, mandala exhaling) than a choice-driven narrowing of options. Cost is conceptual (embracing impermanence) and felt in the final image, though the protagonist's renunciation of fixity could have faced a more explicit internal trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Asha reconciling memory and forgetting after the fire—is signaled but never tightens through on-page opposition or a forced trade-off. The night's mosaic work unfolds without complication or visible cost; no choice narrows options or raises stakes. The departure is a summary denouement, not a crisis that tests commitment. One meaningful deepening (the map of forgetting) shifts her internal stance, but the escalation remains conceptual rather than dramatized with agency and visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (ghost needs an encore to preserve memory) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the coin-threading ritual and Lila's instruction produce the applause. However, escalation is minimal—the ghost follows the same nightly path, then executes Lila's guidance without obstacle or trade-off. No reversal tests his commitment; luck (the orchard's response, Lila's appearance) resolves the need rather than protagonist choice. The cost (Lila gone, orchard dimmed) is atmospheric, not a foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, the ritual's intensification is present but the protagonist's agency in driving it is low.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring mental privacy to pill-affected victims—is signaled early and drives the arc. Mira's breakthrough (muscovite resonance disrupts telepathic signals) meaningfully tightens options, and the first test with Mrs. Chen provides an on-page reversal. However, the escalation from helping one neighbor to "hundreds" occurs in summary, flattening the pressure curve. The cost of Mira's transformation (private refuge to public beacon) is told rather than dramatized at closure, weakening the stake's felt weight in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: become the voice of the unknown before the oceans erase everything. The cold node interrupts the gradient, Aera presses the fossil, and the inversion sequence deepens pressure by draining the walls and forcing her to vocalize. However, the escalation is more mystical unveiling than tactical narrowing—no option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no competing want dramatized. The cost at closure (she will dissolve into rumor, the staff will outlast her) is conceptual and felt but arrives as consequence rather than trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs (the fossil's demand for voice), sufficient at this length under an Accumulative lens, but the protagonist's agency reads more as conduit than decision-maker.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming a broken prophecy into possibility—is signaled but remains abstract throughout; the prophecy's threat is told, not dramatized, so its reweighting lacks concrete pressure. The cataloging montage (grouping buttons "by material, by century, by the pitch of the grief") operates as descriptive labor without on-page reversals or tightening choices that narrow options. Agency is minimal: the jar "quivers," the echo "rushes back inside willingly," and the villager "understood" without a word—outcomes arrive through atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist decision that forecloses a live path. No visible price is paid; the final image asserts hope but never tests it against a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transmit proof of the director's betrayal to fix broken lives. Pressure escalates through layered obstacles (weather-scoured cipher, dead keypad, backup transmitter requiring wind power, vacuum-tube warmup) and the protagonist's agency drives each beat. The confession recording and transmission decision foreclose his safety with visible cost ("destroy him a second time"). The knee injury and bandaging add texture but do not materially narrow tactics. One meaningful tightening (coordinates → station → transmission) is sufficient under the Causal lens, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—distilling complexity into essence before the crossing sinks—is signaled early and drives the coachman's decision to leave the coach and walk the invisible plank. The tightening occurs when the girl instructs him to thread the needle with his last story, narrowing his options to this singular act. Cost is present (the coach dissolves, his role as coachman ends) but reads more as metaphysical transformation than a trade-off with visible consequence for future tactics. The girl's agency is minimal; she orchestrates but does not struggle, reducing the sense of mutual pressure. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through density increase (fog to grayscale, thread to sphere) but the lack of a second on-page reversal or moment where the coachman hesitates keeps this from the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: to restore the oasis and understand why places resist change when "no one remembers how to tend their kindness." The stake is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the thrum deepens, fractured timelines split and overlap, the clay hive is shaped, bees impossibly return, time stitches. Lin's agency (shaping the hive, aligning the glass) drives the resolution. Cost is visible but measured—she walks away, footprints erasing, carrying the lantern as a portable promise of kindness. The piece lacks a sharp reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; instead, pressure accumulates through density and cadence shift. The child's arrival extends the pattern but does not complicate Lin's path—it confirms rather than tests her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reflect light into dark corners by proving the sky exists to the trapped boy. The locked door provides one meaningful tightening that forces theft and escalates risk. Mara's agency drives each beat—steal, pick lock, descend, exchange petal, teach gardening—culminating in the boy's descent with lavender and internalized moon, a renunciation of passivity with visible cost (the gauge tooth lost, the boy now exposed to consequences). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through sensory and spatial deepening. Minor penalty: the landlord opposition and municipal fines are declared but never materialize as on-page friction; the boy's trapped state is asserted more than dramatized, reducing felt stakes. The oar-rhythm motif charges the closure but the middle could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (translate isolation into independence) is signaled early and tested once: the stone circle offers partnership with extinct-species memories, and the gryphon refuses, accepting solitary cartography. The tightening is clear—accept chorus or step back—and the cost is on the page (disappointed hum, continued aloneness, torn page as promise rather than presence). Agency is renunciation that forecloses the path of shared haunting. One minor gap: the middle exploration of "interior sky" and "unmapped space" adds texture but does not materially narrow options or raise price; the core turn is binary (accept/refuse) rather than progressively escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rejoining the world after years of ghostwriting—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens operates through density increase: colors bleed into sentences, the twig becomes a spinning galaxy, doves scatter as paper airplanes. However, the protagonist's agency reads as surrender to a magical installation rather than a choice that narrows live options. The final "I am here" acts as stance crystallization, but the cost (weight of one thrush's nest) is poetic rather than a trade-off with visible consequences on tactics or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: beat the tricksters' subsonic pulse before 02:17 to prevent violence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tricksters adapt mid-attempt, forcing Lyra to abandon the sine generator for chaotic field-recording—agency-driven escalation. Cost is legible: she powers down knowing harmony is "merely paused," and the town's reprieve is temporary. The story does not require multiple reversals at this length. Minor cap: the adversaries' resolution (lowering signs, bewildered eye-contact) lands slightly soft on-page; we see effect more than visceral cost paid by Lyra herself in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the master key) is signaled early and drives all choices. Pressure accumulates through escalating sensory rebellion: organ notes → rails bowing → starlight forming keyhole → shaft opening. The mirror-chamber offers a meaningful trade-off with visible cost: take the key and seal the tunnels forever, foreclosing return but freeing the archives. Arin's agency is decisive: "hesitated only a heartbeat" then commits, and the consequence (missing glass pane, railways sealed) lands on the page. One clear tightening: stepping into the compass circle forces the final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—awakening empathy to paint the erased face—is signaled early and drives the ritual setup. The blood-smearing choice narrows options (irreversible body mark, literal self-sacrifice), and the portrait delivery provides closure. Yet the escalation hinges on a memory unlock rather than a decision under live pressure; the quarry and detective accept the portrait without resistance, leaving the final beats feeling more like resolution-by-revelation than a choice that costs Juniper a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving Edda's voyage to reverse her erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Mara decodes the first line, then again when she assembles the micro-maps. The dirigible launch and wreck recovery constitute one meaningful deepening, and the final choice to stay and catalog carries conceptual cost (she forgoes immediate return). However, the escalation is largely enacted through summary (fourteen squalls pass off-page, the assembly of maps is described rather than dramatized), and the key reversals (Voss's shift from threat to ally, the Ministry's instant approval) lack visible tradeoffs or friction. Agency is present but muted; Mara's choices feel inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure. The cost at closure is told rather than felt in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("sculpt possibility from ashes of never") is signaled but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. The fiddler plays, the glass flake warms, a doorway appears—pressure is asserted through metaphor rather than escalated through protagonist agency or a tightening that forecloses an option. The hitchhiker's hand extended is a reversal in image only; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path before it.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—why grief loops, why paths circle—signals early and tightens through the money-spiral ritual. The arrival of Mara introduces a mirroring pressure (her own failure to cauterize) that deepens the theme without requiring reversal. The resolution is earned by Jonah's renunciation (giving away one bill, walking east, not looking back) with visible cost: the collection is now "fewer by one but finally in circulation." One tightening deepens into closure under the Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves the problem; both characters walk away in opposite directions with reciprocal gifts.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions to witness understanding—is signaled early. The accumulative pressure builds (telegram → telescope → star dims → inscriptions appear → syllables spoken → walls bloom), but the protagonist's agency is primarily receptive witnessing rather than decision that narrows options. The inscriptions "resisted healing; they throbbed with grief" is declared, yet no on-page reversal shows the chronicler trading or forfeiting something concrete to achieve the transformation. The boy's tears and the healed telegram offer closure, but the cost is emotional atmosphere rather than a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—speaking the unspeakable confession to reclaim what mirrors refuse—is signaled early and tightens through the expanding-circle journey. Escalation is driven by Briar's agency: she presses the seed to her wrist (pain as contract), crosses seven circles (each widening the gyre), and finally kneels to speak the confession aloud, a choice that narrows all prior options into a single irreversible act. The cost is unmistakable on the page: the plant binds her, the lake "accepts" and seals, and she is carried outward "into the timber of tomorrow's storms"—the village will now judge her betrayal. One meaningful tightening (the vortex stilling at the seventh circle, forcing speech over freezing) is sufficient at this length and fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—keeping the covenant between city and soil alive—is signaled early and coheres. The maze tightens physically (corridors breathing, thorns threading scars) and the future-vision deepens pressure by showing both utopian towers and choked roots. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is attenuated: the maze "drinks," the clipping "feeds," and the hedge-double steps back, reading more as submission to a mystical process than a protagonist-driven decision that narrows options. One meaningful tightening occurs when thorns graft, but the felt trade-off (mobility for covenant survival) is poetically declared rather than dramatized through a renounced alternate goal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: patching soul-holes from war trauma. The exchange tightens when Lira demands the peas-and-humming memory instead of sunrises, narrowing options with symmetry logic. The narrator's hesitation and Lira's warning ("backing out now would leave the soul holes wider") raise immediate cost. The reversal—Lira sags, one soul puckers another—forces the gate bargain and redefines "patching" as weaving with gaps. Agency is present but reactive until the final offer.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mason rediscovering purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens when he finds the Polaroid and repairs the microphone, a meaningful pivot under the Accumulative lens. The courthouse humiliation provides inciting pressure, and the foreman's offer at the end narrows options (accept community work or remain isolated). However, escalation is gentle: the Polaroid and free microphone arrive without friction, and the foreman's reversal (from canceling the contract to proposing a new one) lacks on-page negotiation or cost. The closure reweights stakes but does not dramatize a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing the archive and understanding transition—is signaled early and accumulates through layered actions (transcribing, planting, humming, etching). The arbor's tilt and mirrored sky deepen the conceptual pressure, and the mother's voice provides a micro-turn. However, escalation is more textural than causal; Mira's agency at the peak (etching the equation) feels more ritual than a trade-off with visible cost. The final step onto the new plank reconfigures options but doesn't foreclose a live alternative with felt price, keeping this in mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine so children can find stories—is signaled early but remains abstract. The process of smelting identities into a ribbon and planting the creel reads as ritual rather than escalating pressure that narrows options. No reversal or tightening choice forces a visible trade-off; the librarian completes her task without meaningful friction or cost. The "accepting contradictions" method is told ("The process required accepting contradictions") rather than dramatized as a struggle that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the pressure remains diffuse and the cost conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—Mara's desire to dissolve emotional walls—is signaled early but remains conceptual until the confession sequence. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when she kneels and voices her own loneliness, then places the crown, but this moment lacks a visible trade-off or narrowed option; the silhouettes accept her without friction. The pearl dissolving and the mirror transformation feel like external reward rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increases, yet the final cost (entrapment in glass) is told rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is self-forgiveness, signaled early and tightened when Lila finds the matching coordinates and chooses to step into the stream, recite her sins aloud, and release the accordion—each narrowing her evasion options with visible cost (cold immersion, instrument lost). The Accumulative lens is held: pressure builds through layered symbols rather than causal reversals. Agency is clear in renunciation. Minor: the escalation is more thematic accretion than a turn that foreclosed a live alternate path; the decision to release the accordion feels determined by the symbolic design rather than a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim stolen voice) is declared but never tested by a dilemma that forces trade-offs. The nine-hour countdown and cyclically reversed doors vanish as pressure; no ticking clock alters her moves. The watch stopping is not a reversal but a marker of arrival. Removing the golden thread (the sole agency moment) occurs without visible cost—no pain, no foreclosed path, no tactical sacrifice. The transformation reads as destiny rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to play the forbidden adagio and trigger imperial collapse—is signaled early and crystallizes at the climax. The piece presents one meaningful tightening when Lira lifts the bow despite knowing the consequences. However, the escalation lacks intermediate reversals or complications; the path from coffee-stain revelation to playing is nearly linear. The cost (empire-wide harvest failure, throne loss) is declared rather than felt on the page; we see none of the immediate human consequences in Lira's present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the spark before oblivion—is signaled early but never tested by a counter-pressure or a cost that narrows options. The protagonist's seven-year ritual and tonight's infusion unfold without reversal, complication, or a moment where the attempt fails and she must adapt. Stepping into the pool is framed as surrender rather than a forced trade-off, and no prior tactic is dramatized and then abandoned with visible loss. The "transaction" (one life for 342 sparks) is declared at closure but not earned through escalating pressure or a decision that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment's source—is signaled early and undergoes one meaningful turn when the caretaker realizes "contentment's source was not a place but a direction—downward." However, this epiphany is immediately declared as arriving "too kindly," undermining its earned quality. The boy's dissipation and re-solidification, the hairpin fusion, and the final descent add texture but do not tighten options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The ending cycles through multiple reconfiguration attempts (descent, sister reconciliation, death, rebirth) without a single decisive pressure point that narrows the caretaker's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: absorb moral unease and return it livable. The researchers' certainty "has fissures," the chimes spell out their doubts, and Mira deciphers the brass bell's devastating message. However, the escalation is primarily revelatory rather than forced by protagonist agency—Mira processes information but the geologist's shift happens through witnessing the shard, not through a costly decision Mira makes that narrows her own options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara teaching her final lesson before vanishing—is signaled early, and the trance-watch ritual creates a purposeful pressure structure. Yet Marcus exhibits no agency or trade-off; he watches passively while revelation is delivered to him in vision-form. The escalation is textural (ring by ring) rather than driven by protagonist choice, and the cost of the cycle is stated ("five years from now") rather than embodied in a present forfeiture or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Cael faces no failure, doubt, or competing pressure; the canyon and towers cooperate immediately when he sings. There is no escalation, no tightening, no choice that forecloses an alternative path. The resolution is unearned: he simply realizes "the wandering pulse had never been lost" without any prior on-page struggle or visible price paid. Agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) is absent; events occur to him rather than through him.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve unmeasured wonder versus guild quantification—is signaled early and tightens when algorithms notice the anomaly. Elian's agency drives the turn: wrapping his badge around the keystone is a renunciation with visible cost (credentialed access forfeited, doors closed, invisibility imposed). The mist-stair wavering forces a mid-beat choice (speaking to the mist) that narrows tactics. No convenience rescue; the ending leaves him marooned with a planted seed of future light.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and guides Jin's dive. One tightening occurs when he must breathe air pockets cautiously to avoid collapsing the archive. The phonograph cylinder provides a crescendo that narrows his understanding, yet the resolution feels granted by discovery rather than forced choice with visible tradeoff. The captain's instruction to "guide the one who listens back" lands as thematic echo rather than a decision that alters Jin's tactics or forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—wavelength align with purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coins cool and demand sacrifice, narrowing Lira's option to refusal or transcendence. However, agency is primarily passive absorption rather than decision under conflicting wants. The "stellar doubt" as internal friction is named but never forces a dramatized trade-off or visible cost on the page. Coincidence does not resolve, but the escalation is more textural accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (naming the nameless fear) is signaled in the opening paragraph. The deepening occurs when the atlas boat capsizes and reveals the reaper's unknowing complicity: souls paid fractions of their deaths to extend his existence. This reweights options and forces the protagonist to act (shattering cylinders, tearing the page, releasing souls). The final renunciation—stepping onto borrowed starlight—shows agency with visible cost (the observatory crumbles, the echo remains). One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: rebuild the ocean through sustained belief. The drip-rate acceleration (47→46→44 seconds, then doubling) provides one meaningful tightening, and Kael's choice to remain as keeper forecloses his prior life with visible cost (death under the viaduct). However, the escalation is told across years rather than dramatized in a second on-page beat, and the dolphin's warning ("not the faith") introduces a problem that resolves off-page through the children's devotion without a visible tactical pivot from Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Marisol's relationship to her father's hidden life and the town's drowned history, signaled early via the bottle and sustained through the photograph trail. The tightening occurs when the final Polaroid reveals her father's foreclosed choice, narrowing Marisol's options: preserve the secret or release it. She chooses release (tearing the label, reframing the narrative) with visible cost—she forgoes sole ownership of her father's story. The escalation is meaningful but the on-page moment of choice is compressed; a beat showing her hesitation or competing pull would deepen the visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving reason and reverence can share one crucible—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through spatial narrowing (canyon → orchard → specific tree → crystal) and sensory intensification (scent "so sharp it tasted metallic"). The flame ritual and the crystal's hovering drop create one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting options (dissolve the crystal or not). Agency is present in her choice to lower the crystal into flame, though the starling flock and the drop's autonomous behavior (refuses to fall, swells, hovers) dilute protagonist control at the peak moment. The final transformation passes "through her like a wave," more done-to than chosen, which lowers the felt cost of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the network's secrecy versus trust the familiar signal—is signaled early and tightens when the glider violates the ceiling and flashes the stolen code. The descent and buckle-handoff constitute protagonist agency that forecloses her prior stance (watching forever) with visible cost (lighter by one buckle, heavier by one choice). Under the Accumulative lens, the single meaningful deepening (realizing the vigil itself became the threat) is sufficient for this length and reweights the watcher's burden. One friction: the older-self reveal softens the antagonistic pressure into allegory, reducing the felt cost of misjudgment; coincidence (time-folded double) enables rather than complicates resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    The custody ritual provides a single dominant stake signaled early. The round-by-round confessions tighten pressure as the brain pulses, and Zero's falter when asked to name his fear constitutes one meaningful reversal. The final choice to pour the fluid and merge forecloses dual custody with a synthesis outcome. Cost is implied—both prior identities dissolve—but the page does not show what Mara sacrifices in lived terms; the ending reads as harmonious union rather than trade-off with felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore Quinn's laughter to break the house's silence—signals in paragraph two and tightens decisively when the tunnel returns only "engine, only echo, no bright marble laugh," forcing Ellery to shift from literal resurrection to symbolic tending. The pivot to "gentler, feeding fuel in measured sighs" narrows tactics under visible cost: he must renounce the fantasy and accept echo as sufficient haunting. The wife's chuckle and the house's exhale land the relational and atmospheric consequences on the page. Escalation coheres under the accumulative lens with no coincidence solving the problem; Ellery's agency—conducting, then kneeling, then placing the cord—drives each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to cross the boundary into the un-frozen garden—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure accumulates through poetic restatement rather than tightening. The guardian's nightly ritual (offering the pendant, taking it back) is described as ongoing practice without a catalyst that forces tonight to differ from prior nights. The final choice to leave the pendant and turn back reads as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (foregoing passage, accepting companionship with uncertainty), yet the decision feels contemplative rather than forced by escalating pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boundary "parted just enough to reveal another garden," but this revelation does not narrow her options—she was already committed to non-crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (interrupt destiny via transmutation) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the ritual steps: blood-counting, ash-tipping, steam-geyser. The final creature's warning ("the next cage may be stranger") reweights the cost, and offering the goggles forecloses sight with symbolic price. However, escalation is procedural—no live setback or tactical pivot occurs. The alchemist never struggles against failure or adapts; the ritual succeeds on schedule, muting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—tuning the shard of hush before it silences all transmission—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragment and shard magnetize, forcing the tuning attempt. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency; the shard behaves conveniently (sliding "like a cat to a hearth") and dissolves on its own. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid at closure. The resolution grants the interpreter newfound certainty and a plan to build anew, but this reads as reward without sacrifice, undercutting the felt cost required for high-band entry under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—save the vanishing ferry and its passengers—is signaled early and tightens when the radio warns "only half here" and the grotto begins closing. Arden's agency drives escalation: he speaks coordinates, steers via patterns, and flips the hourglass twice to reverse the flow, each move narrowing options under accumulative pressure. The cost is legible on-page: the hourglass crumbles, the grotto closes, and Arden must pour one timeline into the other, forgoing the alternate path. One meaningful deepening occurs when passengers flicker and Arden's motivation crystallizes: "if he could anchor the ferry... he could step off at a dock that remembered his name." The resolution hinges on protagonist choice with visible consequence (solidified ferry, crumbled hourglass), meeting the lens and cost tests cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover the texture of connection") is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off or narrowing choice. The weaving accelerates and "patterns become more complex," yet no reversal forces her to choose between competing goods or forgo a path. The composite man's dissolution and the gallery's settling are presented as revelations rather than earned turns driven by protagonist agency. No visible price (time, stamina, relational cost) alters her tactics, and coincidence (dawn breaking, gallery stabilizing) resolves pressure without her renunciation or endurance foreclosing an option.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching navigation in a world where stars have wandered—is signaled early and threads through the lesson. The boy's question "if we learn this, can we go back?" introduces a secondary tension, and the instructor's choice to take him to the spire for solo instruction tightens pressure. The final exchange narrows options: she gives away her last anchor to the past, foreclosing her own claim to return. Cost is visible in the hollow left behind and her resolve to "teach again." Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the boy's bleeding fingers and sighted path provide texture. However, the escalation is more conceptual than tactical; no live obstacle tests the method on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—protecting Lila's posthumous credit and shielding future volunteers—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Mira discovers the ledger, then escalates when Hask intercepts her, forcing the upload gambit. The final reversal (Hask's collapse, alarm triggered, ledger handed to paramedics) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: Mira exposes herself to Ministry scrutiny and loses her tool (the hearing aid dies). One credible tightening that narrows options is present, meeting length requirements, though Hask's collapse from "gravity of voices" leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: witness and return the forgotten technicians. Pressure escalates through physical constraint (corridor narrows, air thickens to brine) and accumulating horror (technicians progressively more merged with equipment). The reversal at Voss—"I kept the circuit open so someone could find the way back"—reweights the entire descent as rescue rather than mere memorial. Agency is embodied: Mara speaks each name aloud, anchoring them; places her glove over Voss's to initiate return. Coincidence does not resolve (the gold fleck was seeded from the start, not conjured). Cost is visible: she accepts the obligation of remembering, "names repeating in her chest like heartbeat," and walks landward carrying their story.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: to reclaim embodied existence and deliver the fetched wisdom before dawn's correction. The ink-defragmentation beat is the sole on-page tightening; it shifts the protagonist from passive observation to active pattern-reading, then to the choice to "slice the digital film." The descent to the clerk and the decision to leave the shard constitute agency with visible cost—the protagonist walks away from the observatory and its "midnight solace," forecloses return. However, no live opposition tests the choice; the clerk's weeping provides emotional texture but no tactical friction. The "correction finalized at dawn" functions as declared countdown pressure, never dramatized as a closing window that alters tactics. Escalation is conceptual (understanding failure-as-corridor) rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: preserve the dying river-tongue before silence erases it. The piece signals one tightening when she swallows the diamond, accepting the curse's price, but the escalation lacks friction—no false starts, no failed attempts, no moment when the method nearly collapses. Agency is present (she chooses to descend, to speak, to swallow) but the ritual proceeds without reversals or narrowing options. The cost is visible (calcification, death) yet arrives on schedule rather than through struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the absence of genuine resistance or trade-off caps the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding the moth-winged sightings—is signaled early but never escalates through Mara's agency; she observes, records, and is acted upon by the arrowhead and phone rather than making choices that narrow her options. The seventh-night arrowhead warming is a coincidental trigger, not a reversal earned by prior decisions. No visible cost attends the metamorphosis: bitterness "evaporates," the city wakes "laughing," and Mara joins the harmony without foreclosing a live option or paying a felt price. The university's directive to "debunk the sightings" could have generated conflict between duty and transformation, but that tension is mentioned once and never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (uproot the seed before calcification) is signaled early. One meaningful turn: the backward lullaby confuses the statues, allowing Calla to advance and extract the seed. However, this success arrives without visible cost or foreclosed option—statues freeze cooperatively, the seed comes free, and Calla walks away unscathed. The escalation is textural (softer music, rising blossoms) rather than a choice that narrows her path or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where broken promises heal—is signaled early and tightens when Riven locates the console and later the decommissioned mailbox. The thunderstorm-for-letters trade is a meaningful tightening that forecloses retreat and transforms the situation, yet the escalation feels more textural (density increase, atmospheric shift) than causal narrowing. Cost is legible in the final image (the route closes at dawn; guards lower rifles; letters arrive), but the price paid on the page is conceptual rather than visceral. Agency is present in the trade and the choice to place the storm in the mailbox, but coincidence assists: the tokens "clatter… spelling the route" without prior setup, and the soda machine yielding a key feels convenient. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the ending reweights options, but a second on-page turn that forces a harder tradeoff would elevate this band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (the search for the halo fragment to "interpret silence as possibility") is signaled early and drives the middle section. The discovery tightens when his fingertips touch the fragment and it lifts, projecting the trapeze artist's shadow—one meaningful deepening that reweights his relationship to silence. However, the escalation lacks a second turn or visible trade-off; the carpenter's agency at closure is acceptance rather than decision, and no live option is foreclosed on the page with unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live before they become words"—is clearly signaled but resolves without struggle: Ms. Penumbra steps between shelves, discovers pre-narratives as "topological pressure," and returns to her post, mission complete. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the scarf's guidance is frictionless, and patrons pass through her "feeling only the familiar shiver of inspiration" without complicating her quest. Agency is absent—she observes and is led, never deciding under pressure. The resolution ("she had helped awaken") tells outcome without showing a choice, trade-off, or visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—capturing the dream to decode the cipher and restore erased voices—is signaled early and drives all movement. Pressure accumulates through the violet morning journey, painted contrails guiding the sun, and the dream-boat's approach, culminating in the decisive shutter click and palette crack that foreclose prior tactics. One meaningful tightening is present (the instant the boat passes, she snaps the frame), and cost is legible (palette destroyed, colors absorbed into skin). However, the escalation feels more atmospheric than volitional—Mireya's agency in coaxing the dream is gestural rather than trade-off driven—and the resolution hinges on the archipelago's autonomous transfer of the image, reducing protagonist pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("free an idea trapped behind fear") is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or live cost. The locksmith faces no meaningful opposition; the gates lean passively, the ivy reveals the keyhole, the mirror shatters "soundlessly," and the cub leaps into her mouth without resistance. Agency reads as ritual performance rather than decision under pressure. The single tightening moment—cutting the reflection—occurs without foreclosing an alternative or dramatizing a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early and drives the scalpel choice at center. One meaningful tightening: the sextant moment surfaces a memory and urges final forgetting, forcing Mara to choose reclamation with visible cost (renouncing safety). The mushroom pulses brighter, applying pressure; her refusal forecloses the path and carries consequence (greenhouse shudders, ring withers). Agency is decision with on-page cost. No explicit antagonist, but coincidence does not resolve; protagonist choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (refusal to forget versus exile). The tea-leaf prediction introduces a fork, but the child's arrival feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven. The seven-circuit ritual and page-catching provide one tightening moment that reweights options. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens needs sharper visible cost; the resolution asserts that Lira "remembered for both" without a dramatized forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's color before the orchard's final flowering—is signaled early and tightens when the weave begins pulling back, threatening to reclaim the droplets. Arin's decision to fling the droplets rather than hoard them narrows options (the loom collapses, ending his original plan). Yet the escalation reads more as realization than forced trade-off; the veil "widening into a door" and citizens "pausing mid-stride" feel serendipitous rather than driven by Arin's prior tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: freeing the fisherman's spirit by unraveling the net. Pressure accumulates via the textural lens as each knot releases a story, building toward the fisherman stepping free. The tightening is more additive than conflicted—Elian faces no meaningful obstruction or competing pull that tests his commitment. The fisherman's confession ("I've been drowning in what I never said") provides emotional depth, but the resolution arrives without visible cost to Elian beyond effort. Agency is present (Elian's needle work) but the escalation lacks a moment where success is genuinely in doubt or a painful trade-off is required.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (interpreting silence as language versus emptiness) is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the chapel responds to matched stillness. One meaningful turn: her recognition that "the chapel did not open by force" forecloses the conquest approach. The final choice—to leave without translating—shows renunciation with cost (no footage carried, only openness). Agency reads as attention and endurance under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more deepening than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes the buried 1914 number, forcing her to "confess the weight" she hoped the lost object would carry. The reversal occurs when Elias reveals the secret is "not aerodynamic but contractual," reframing her nightly ritual and narrowing options to acceptance. The cost is visible: the notebook dissolves unread, the miniature Electra settles "already becoming artifact rather than absence," and Mara surfaces alone, lighter but without the companion she named. Agency is clear in the choice to tip the globe and write the release line, though the escalation could press harder with competing wants in active friction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs before thunder erases them—is signaled early but never tested. Lyra paints faster when the echo objects, but the echo immediately helps rather than opposing, so no tightening occurs. Thunder arrives and deepens colors instead of erasing anything, reversing the stated threat without consequence. The piece declares urgency ("between lightning and thunder") yet no choice is foreclosed and no cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Lira seeks to understand why the captain smiled—implicitly, to find the joy beneath his death. The diary discovery tightens options by revealing the map and seed, and her choice to descend and plant rather than report forecloses her servant path with on-page cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the goggles reveal the cipher, then again when the map and seed reconfigure her understanding. Coincidence—the gust that unlocks the diary—feels borderline convenient, though the prior cipher work mitigates it. The price (remaining below, trading mobility for rootedness) is visible and scaled appropriately to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is clear: memorialize the cloud-emotion proof before the gondola falls. Pressure accumulates through cable deterioration and the ritual of releasing kites. Agency is present in the decision to speak her mother's name into the spool and step out into the void—both acts foreclose return. The cost is visible (her life). Weakness: the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; once the cable begins fraying, Mara enacts a prepared sequence without meaningful on-page adaptation or conflict between competing goals. The tightening is textural rather than driven by protagonist choice under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the guild's sky-memory before demolition—is clear from the first paragraph. Pressure tightens when the siren countdown begins and the first explosion forces faster work, narrowing her window. The cost is legible: she leaves behind her creation, unseen by her own eyes, accepting that memory outlasts recognition. However, the escalation is more temporal (external countdown) than driven by protagonist agency or internal trade-offs; she executes her plan without meaningful obstacles or renunciations that would deepen the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is clear: prevent the airship's lights from failing and keep *Aurelia* aloft. Pressure coheres and tightens once (lamps dim further, Lira sprints to the engine galley). The chief engineer's prompt—"Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn; got one?"—arrives as a new rule rather than an earned escalation from prior tactics, reducing agency. Lira's reading of the dialects works, but coincidence resolves: the starlings form a double-helix that mirrors her tracings without prior setup, and the ship "inhales" without Lira making a trade-off. The resolution is protagonist-initiated but feels convenient. No visible price is paid; Lira gains recognition and a shared horizon without forfeiting a path or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (learning the rhythm of repair to mend his own irregular heart) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One on-page tightening: Rowan's doubt ("if no gear fit, the rhythm of repair would stay a stranger") is answered when he notices the mirror-versions and performs the key-healing action, which narrows his path and opens the door. The final cost is conceptual and spatial—the doorway vanishes, foreclosing return—but it's understated and arrives without a visceral trade-off or loss of a live option during the attempt. The escalation is largely interior and observational; Rowan's agency is more receptive (noticing, aligning) than decisive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: save the orchards via coordinated harvest before the eclipse. The pressure tightens once—Mara's doubt ("why follow a ghost who might vanish?") forces her to prove motives through labor (knocking fruit only when hands are ready), and the final chalk message terrifies and thrills the colonists into forming human chains. The escalation is lean but clear: from messages to guided action to collective risk above cloud. Cost is visible in the image of Mara as counterweight and in her release, though the colonists' internal friction ("arguments before they formed") is suppressed by the nebula rather than dramatized. Agency belongs to Mara's orchestration and the colonists' coordinated response; no luck solves the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—stopping the doomsday clock by threading the lullaby through the pane—is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each lullaby iteration makes the pane more transparent and pulls midnight back. The protagonist's agency is renunciation with cost: she accepts eternal immobility to save "villages that would wake tomorrow unaware." One meaningful deepening (the nested recursions that collapse into "a single moment") narrows options and the price is legible. However, escalation is more textural than driven by protagonist decision; the iterations feel more like ritual steps than choices that test commitment or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear: guide the travelers out before frost forms. Pressure coheres under the situational lens via the ticking clock, the seven-fork junction, and the deceptive moonlight at the final choice. One meaningful tightening when Mara crushes the nut-kernel to make a glowing handprint, escalating her method. The travelers' response to the handprint narrows options and alters tactics. Cost is conceptual (her ongoing imprisonment) rather than a live forfeiture in the closure beat; the resolution is earned by Mara's agency but the price feels more thematic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection, atone for the refused call—is signaled early and tightens when Mara's lab work materializes the ravine insight into tactile sculpture. One meaningful reversal: the insight that "the chrysalis was not empty; it was a mold" narrows options from passive scattering to active creation. The final act (placing sculptures, walking away) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (surrendering control, "pockets empty"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no second reversal is required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping negative space where stories begin by selling clean slates—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through layered transactions: the boy trades cracked marble and sigh for moonlight, the vendor snips rain-scent from air and trades it for the librarian's ability to forget, and the orchard grows heavier under narratives "that had not yet earned the right to happen." One meaningful tightening occurs when the vendor realizes "she had been the protagonist all along" and must subtract herself, but this turn feels conceptual rather than dramatized through a forced choice with visible cost. Agency is present but abstract; the final act of drinking moonlight and becoming a door outline reads more like thematic inevitability than a decision that forecloses a live option under dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marisol came "to sandpaper these rough memories clean." Pressure deepens when she discovers the pavilion's oceanic grief is "older and deeper than any human sorrow," forcing a reversal of her intent—she gives instead of taking. The resolution is driven by her agency (pressing palms flat, pouring her memories) with a legible emotional cost (releasing her own joys). The tightening is meaningful but the felt price at closure could be sharper; the transformation reads more lyric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the conversation between tower and elevator before dawn—is signaled early and drives Mireya's actions. One meaningful tightening occurs when the elevator demands "Build me a bridge, librarian, or let me rot," but the escalation is told rather than dramatized through narrowing options. Agency reads as execution rather than decision: Mireya never faces a trade-off or renunciation; she simply completes the technical sequence. The cost (exhaustion, apron dust) is mentioned but not legible as a forfeiture that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: extract entangled worker dreams to resurrect them as machines. One clear tightening occurs when the moon slides and the mirror's angle fails, collapsing the engines mid-assembly—an on-page reversal driven by environmental constraint. Agency is present but muted: Mara calibrates, activates, then endures collapse; the final choice to return with better tools feels more like default persistence than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. The cost (bloodied, burned mirror) is visible but does not visibly alter her stance or narrow future paths on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rescuing forgotten combinations to restore the Archive's memory—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure escalates via the ticking clock (gravity inversion counting down), the threat of vigilance seeds blooming into defensive fire, and threshold effects jittering as she sprints to exit. One meaningful tightening occurs when she speaks the combinations and must modulate her voice to prevent the seeds from waking. The resolution is earned by her technique and persistence, though the cost remains conceptual (doodle spent, grotto sealed) rather than a visible personal forfeiture that narrows her future options.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—restore music to a silent world—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: mapping cracks → strumming → grove joins. The final image shows a cost (trembling, spell-breaking restraint) and the world reweights from silence to conversation. However, no genuine opposition or foreclosed alternative appears; Ilay's progression is smooth, and the "cost" reads more as exhaustion than a trade-off that narrows options, keeping the score below high band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—correlating silence to find meaning after exile—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with trade-offs. No on-page reversal or escalation; the tutor stands, reflects, and resolves without cost. The "eclipsed covenant" backstory (Lord Ashford's political exposure) is told but never tests the tutor in present action. Agency is assertion ("he would teach") rather than decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—cataloging silences to teach empathy—is signaled early and tightens through four escalating frequencies. The turn when she realizes the clasp "had never been meant to lock anything away" deepens understanding and forecloses the original goal (keeping secrets shut). Agency is present in each dial twist and the final choice to leave the clasp broadcasting. However, the escalation reads more as lyric accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure; no external resistance tests her commitment. The cost (renouncing secrecy, accepting the sister's loss) is felt but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: achieve serenity within motion by grafting the corpse flower without alerting pollinators. Pressure coheres through olfactory risk (one wrong note spoils years), timing to the forest's pulse, and the need for stillness within sway. The reversal—village astonishes her instead—narrows her ambition into gratitude with visible cost (she releases the notebook, ends the chase). Agency is clear in the graft-site choice and the ritual offering. The tightening is meaningful but one pass; entering 8.5+ would require a second trade-off with sharper price.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering resilience's source—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The inversion hour provides a ticking constraint and Aera's ascent tightens options as she follows water flow to the Silent Core. The sapling sequence accelerates generations in a compressed beat, deepening understanding. However, external opposition is minimal; Aera's journey reads as exploration rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt interpersonal or survival cost. The final decision to share the arrow carries thematic weight but lacks a visible trade-off or price that would anchor high-band conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the port went silent to prevent future catastrophes—is signaled early and coheres. Mara's survey tightens spatially (vectors converge), and the plaza discovery intensifies the mystery. Yet the escalation is more accretive than agonistic: she adapts rapidly without friction, encounters no on-page obstacle that forces a costly tradeoff, and the final act (writing backward, containers realigning) happens to her as much as through her agency. The "reversing every arrow" beat gestures at reversal but is told as summary; the cost (dissolving patch, printed warnings) is symbolic rather than a visible forfeiture that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder to the Council—is signaled early but never tested by opposition; no Council agent appears, no time pressure tightens, no cost accrues for failure. The Echoless Vein is billed as a guardian but dissolves upon Elian's exhale without resistance. The test ("prove he valued wonder over utility") is declared and instantly passed by ringing the bells once. No reversal, no foreclosed option, no visible price paid—escalation is asserted in imagery but not dramatized through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand why the flute "obeyed her breath yet mocked her intent." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accretes through descent, marker arrangement, listening, and the seam's widening—each beat deepens her engagement with failure. The tightening occurs when the reflection speaks and Kaelen recognizes "the failure is still growing," forcing the renunciation. Cost is legible: she walks away without the flute, foreclosing guardianship and mastery. The escalation is more contemplative than agonistic—no opponent, no reversal—but the lens supports this mode and the final trade-off (object for insight) carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding emotion's mathematics versus feeling others—is signaled early but remains thematic rather than tactical. Escalation occurs (widow's grief → astronomer's logic → child of light → reversal), yet the reversal choice lacks visible cost because we don't know what Quince loses by becoming "blank." No on-page foreclosed path or trade-off is dramatized; the stars return, the halo cracks, and the ending declares weightlessness without showing what he wanted to keep. Agency is present but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a routine courier or step into legend—is signaled early. The pendant's intensifying vibration and the woman's arrival create one meaningful tightening. But the escalation is largely passive: Elias watches the pendant leap unbidden, hears exposition, then "walks forward" without a decision that visibly forecloses an option. The cost (becoming "more than memory could hold") is told in retrospect rather than dramatized in a present-tense choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: commune with sister's absorbed sorrow to manage his grief. The ritual tightens through escalating lies and environmental responses, culminating in the truthful admission that cracks the hush. Cost is legible: he leaves the prism behind, repositioning grief rather than erasing it. However, the escalation mechanism (lies warming the prism, freezing mist) reads more as lyric correlation than agentic narrowing of options, slightly softening the felt necessity of each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "the yarn itself wanted to speak but had forgotten the shape of words." One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes "the bargain: to carry a message across that gap she must offer the only voice still hers." Agency is clear—she crushes the bead, swallows it, winds words onto the bobbin—and the cost is visible: permanent muteness. The resolution is earned by her choices under accumulative pressure. The middle puzzle-assembly sequence lacks a second reversal or complication; escalation reads as density increase rather than a twist, which fits the accumulative lens but limits band height in Q4.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: restore the forge/find purpose, signaled early. One tightening: ladder touches arch, arches descend. Agency is present (Thistle builds, climbs, ties), but the silk's magic solves the problem without visible trade-off or constraint—he never runs out, fails, or sacrifices anything tangible on the page. The villagers' "confusion transforming into wonder" is told, not dramatized through their choices. Under Accumulative lens, the escalation is a single intensification (climbing, tying knot), which is minimal but acceptable; however, cost remains abstract and off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discover withheld truth about the lover's vanishing) is signaled early and tightens through the parallel-bay traversal. The locker discovery and self-authored note create one meaningful deepening that narrows options toward the complicity revelation. Agency is present in the final renunciation/redirection choice. However, the escalation feels more textural than pressure-driven; the protagonist's traversal encounters minimal resistance, and the cost of complicity (selling maps) is declared rather than tested on the page through a choice that forces visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (protect the tower from forgetting, keep the anonymous chain unbroken) is signaled early and tightens when "tonight the dark came sooner" and Elias fears the keeper may have "stepped over the rail." His agency—adding the fourth stone, bottling the sea glass, building the second cairn—forecloses passivity with visible cost: the stones are apologies "for lives he reached too late," and the newest, pink granite, carries the weight of the widow's cove. The click overhead and his understanding ("she was still keeping, still asking") constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights his endurance as sufficient rather than futile. Coincidence does not resolve; the lamp stays dark, yet the ritual persists. One escalation point (lamp dies, fear for the keeper) drives the peak choices with felt price (his solitary vigil, the ache "sharper" tonight).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: shape a new dawn using ancient shadows, signaled in the motivation line. One meaningful tightening occurs when "her third laugh split into seven echoes that arranged themselves as directions," forcing navigation choices. However, the sequence from black flame ignition through sail deployment to lighthouse dissolution reads as accumulative metaphor rather than a decision point where live options are forfeited with visible cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency remains atmospheric—Lirael's laughter triggers transformations without a dramatized trade-off or price that alters her later tactics. The cost (lighthouse and routine vanish) is legible at closure but not tested by a mid-story reversal that narrows her path under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and maintained, but escalation is summary-driven rather than choice-driven. Hoshiko receives memories, paints the wing, and arrives at understanding without a meaningful on-page tightening that forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The piece layers texture (tea vapor forming dragons, scales becoming pigment) but never dramatizes a moment where she must renounce collection, risk discovery, or pay a visible price to pursue her question.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—deconstructing quantified sorrow to learn what trees witness—is signaled early and tightens as Mara maps dreams, lowers ambient sorrow by "measurable milligrams," and transforms the sextant. The piece achieves one meaningful deepening when she "understood then: the trees witness every calculation" and begins unscrewing brass limbs, an action that forecloses the instrument's return and carries visible cost (loss of the astronomer's tool). The pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is gradual rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm by recovering melody—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening occurs when tarry vines attack and shatter the mica window, forcing the keeper to drive shards into her chest to sharpen recollection. However, the turn from her solo song to collective chorus involves silhouettes appearing "from the shadows" without clear agency or price; they align with her melody but no dramatized choice earns their participation. The cost at closure (letting them keep her name) is told rather than shown as a trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unearthing wisdom in her mistake or dying—is signaled early, and the midnight purge provides a ticking constraint. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than action-driven; Elara kneels and reads rather than making a sequence of harder choices. Vale's arrival and acceptance feels more like confirmation than a reversal that narrows options. The cost of disappearing is conceptual (surrendering the future) but not dramatized as a visible trade-off that forecloses a lived alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving city memory against erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. The guerrilla gardening sequence provides one meaningful deepening (shops beginning to reveal older paint), but this happens passively rather than through a choice that narrows options. No reversal or trade-off appears; Mila's path widens rather than tightens. Agency is limited: the gardener instructs, Mila executes, and outcomes unfold without visible cost or sacrifice. The ending reconfigures meaning but does not test Mila's commitment under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—measuring the last frequencies of human virtues before they vanish—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates as fuel dwindles and vows dissolve in sequence (loyalty snaps, mercy collapses, stewardship already gone, wonder fights longest), creating a tightening time constraint. However, the protagonist's agency does not drive escalation; the lantern's depletion is external coincidence, and her response is to work faster without facing a trade-off or renunciation. The shattering of the slide and her choice to leave it behind offer a micro-turn, but no on-page cost visibly forecloses a path—she completes all measurements and retains the data, so resolution feels observational rather than earned by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: trade the fob to record trust breaking before sunrise. One tightening: rehearsed rescues fail, tide rises, dawn arrives—each narrows the window for reversal. Agency is present: the narrator chooses to open her fist despite wanting the father to intervene, foreclosing the bond. Cost is legible in the "small wet click" and the gulls' broadcast, plus the felt emptiness. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through rising density and the cadence shift at first light. Minor: Jonah's passive role (he nods, waits, records) limits interpersonal friction; the father's off-stage absence is thematically apt but reduces on-page opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early but resolved through exposition rather than escalating pressure. The convergence moment ("their personal atmospheres began to merge") could constitute a turn, but it arrives without visible cost or tactical narrowing. The woman's departure and seed gift feel ceremonial rather than hard-won. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the skeptic's resistance "melts" passively, and the seed promises future transformation that occurs off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with her mother's dissolution and her own creative paralysis—is signaled early and tightens when she finds the unfinished self-portrait. The act of completing the drawing generates immediate response (crystals grow, lock opens, laughter returns), creating one meaningful pressure point. However, the escalation relies heavily on the cave's quasi-magical responsiveness rather than protagonist agency under constraint; she draws and the world rewards her without visible cost or tradeoff in the moment. The final shift (giving away blank sheets instead of selling portraits) implies renunciation but is summarized rather than dramatized as a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—finding lost conversations and confronting loneliness—is signaled early and deepens when Aurelia discovers the unsent letters and admits "I am lonely beneath my gilt." The cathedral repository and Corin's appearance provide one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is gentle: no live option is foreclosed, no tactic forced to shift. The vines lifting and the decision to return nightly feel thematically resonant but lack a visible trade-off or price paid on the page. The resolution relies on mutual recognition rather than a choice under competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's frequency before the comet's passage—is signaled early and sustained through the tuner's calibration work. Pressure accumulates via the comet's approach and the sculpture's readiness, but the escalation lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; the tuner completes her adjustments without visible friction, error, or trade-off. The ending reconfigures the mission (entrusting the sculpture to wind and passing the wedge to the boy), yet the cost remains thematic rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or visible sacrifice during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: execute the controlled burn to preserve the farm versus honor the children's memories the box represents. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as magnetic north shifts and miniaturization begins, forcing K-17 to choose between protocol and the expanding box. The decision to open the box and integrate it rather than compress it provides one meaningful turn that narrows options—K-17 plants itself, accepting transformation. Visible cost appears in the centuries of waiting and the loss of pure android function ("neither android nor memory, but both"). However, the escalation relies heavily on metaphorical assertion ("the box refused compression, expanding instead") rather than a concrete tactical dilemma with visible tradeoffs. The ending's conceptual repricing charges the image but lacks a prior on-page moment where K-17 visibly forfeits an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is present: the rattling mailbox mystery and Mira's desire to prove listening heals. Pressure tightens once—from mechanical investigation (borescope) to renunciation of tools in favor of witnessing—but the turn lacks on-page cost or trade-off. The neighbors' gathering supplies atmosphere rather than oppositional force; no character challenges Mira's approach or introduces complication that she must overcome through agency. The resolution (mailbox quiets, offerings appear) feels granted rather than earned by protagonist decision, and coincidence (the locket's heartbeat merging with ambient sound) resolves rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient at this length, but visible cost is absent, capping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding and liberating the encrypted seed before the spider finishes—is signaled early and tightens once: the dice roll forces the arabesque into the vortex, opening the archive. Mara's swallowing of the page is a high-agency renunciation (no external copy, bodily risk) with visible cost. The scientists' choice to flood the lab rather than allow weaponization adds a secondary ethical layer. However, the escalation is mostly linear accretion rather than a reversal that narrows options; the buoy trigger and air release feel more like a scheduled exit than a forced trade-off. The cost is legible on the page (ingestion, surfacing vulnerability) and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: retrieve sister's deleted memories. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence—flowers, mist, gravity collapse, memory emergence—ending in a trade-off: release the memories city-wide rather than keep them. The cost is legible on the page: "her fingers passed through," the flowers crumble, she folds the dust and disperses it. One meaningful tightening (ritual to release) fits the Accumulative lens. Agency is renunciation with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the cranes' multiplication and the prophecy's counter-drumbeat, and the summoner's swallowing of the sphere is an act of agency with stated cost. However, the escalation is more textural than causal: the drumbeat "arrives" and then "falters" without a clear because/therefore link to the summoner's specific actions. No live option is visibly foreclosed; the summoner completes the ritual and walks away, but we do not see what he sacrificed or lost beyond the abstract "weight" he accepts. One meaningful tightening (the drumbeat forcing the inverse word) is present, but the cost remains more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: becoming fluent in the language of buildings, which braids with loneliness and the tutor's ontological need. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tutor reveals her nature and dissipates, forcing the narrator to step into the keeper role. The choice to approach Mrs. Chen with the first "agreed upon lie" narrows options with visible cost (perpetuating the cycle). Agency is decision and acceptance; the narrator's final stance crystallizes in the act of waiting "for the roof to call me teacher." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through motif repetition (seal, "stay," sugar-borrowing) that reweights meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming her quarantined memory—is signaled early and drives all movement. One meaningful tightening occurs when the memory transfer demands color vision as payment, forcing a visible trade-off between sensory wholeness and psychic autonomy. The escalation from personal retrieval to communal archive deepens the stakes at closure. However, the opposition remains abstract (the Memory Health Bureau) rather than embodied in scene, and Mara's agency in the central beat (kneeling, humming) feels more ritual than contested choice, slightly diluting pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—Mara's internal forgiveness—is announced but never tested by external pressure or a forced trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; she decides to stop forging and forgive herself without on-page cost or resistance. "Calibrated treason" is mentioned repeatedly but its mechanics and risks remain abstract, preventing escalation from operating under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (learning why some echo to ensure her life won't loop) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: recognizing her mother's voice in the cocoon and realizing "unfinished departures loop, while complete goodbyes travel on" reweights her understanding and narrows options to one—sing the missing cadence. Agency is present: Lira chooses to press the shell and sing farewell, forecloses the path of endless echo. Cost is conceptual (she must leave echo behind, accept endings) and legible in the final image ("ensuring her life would travel rather than reverberate"), but the felt price on the page is muted—no visible sacrifice of a resource, relationship, or tactical option that would sharpen escalation. The weaver's cooperation and the cocoon's dissolution occur smoothly without resistance or complication, softening pressure. No antagonist or reversal; accumulative lens permits this, but the single tightening lacks the visceral trade-off or visible loss that would enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—salvage something pure—is declared but never tested by a meaningful on-page choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The glacier "answers with silence, then with a single crack" is coincidental opening rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Marrow's journey through the wreck involves no tactical trade-offs, no loss of resource or stamina, and no moral calculus; the drowned passengers guide rather than oppose. The ending gesture (placing the globe on snow, walking away) carries no legible price—she retains the knowledge, the future vision, and the ability to return, making the renunciation ceremonial rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—appreciation of hidden effort—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tightens into a forced choice with legible alternatives. The whisk discovery is a fortunate find, not a reversal that narrows options or raises cost. The oarsman's changed course and the firefly synchronization read as ambient validation rather than pressure. Agency is limited: the protagonist walks a spiral, finds the object, and returns to work; no on-page decision forecloses a path or demands a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (the inscription's reveal), but it does not alter tactics or crystallize a stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—excavate truth from archived lies—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the reassembly sequence and peaks when the diamond's playback forces Marisol to inventory her own complicity. The tightening occurs when she nearly drops the stone but chooses instead to broadcast it, a renunciation of personal possession that forecloses the path of amnesia. The cost is legible (she gives up the comfort of forgetting) but remains conceptual; the final act feels more like thematic demonstration than a choice forced by contradictory wants under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reshaping reality by becoming the shadow/prophet—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara receives coordinates and the final transmission. The moment she hits enter and walks through the portico narrows options with visible cost (erasure, dissolution). However, the escalation path lacks a middle reversal or complication; the story moves from reception to decision without a beat where new information forces Elara to reconsider or pay an intermediate price. The cost at closure is legible but arrives in a single tightening rather than a deepening pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the music box to preserve generational memory—is signaled early and tightens when Posy finally opens the rusted lid. The child's request provides external pressure, and Posy's choice to "speak the jars into the box" narrows options with visible effort. However, the music box's sudden cooperation (it "shut itself with a click soft as forgiveness") and the child's perfectly timed arrival at the hatch reduce the earned tension; coincidence resolves rather than complicates, and the cost feels more asserted than paid in tactile consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (protect the Echo or nightmares solidify) and pressure tightens when ice calves, forcing a trade-off between artifact and marina. Mireya's agency drives the climax: she chooses a third path by changing the bowing pattern, a decision rooted in her engineer expertise. One meaningful reversal occurs on-page (shadows hesitate, then soften into forgiven silhouettes). Cost is visible: the key's teeth worn smooth, her ongoing duty inscribed in the final promise. The "logically emotional calculus" moment risks abstraction but is grounded enough by the immediate physical peril (ice splitting, shadows closing) to sustain pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: provide the exact instant for a patient revolution. Pressure accumulates through moon-path deviations, viaduct pulse deepening, and the spiral tightening to a keystone point. The tightening is meaningful—Elian must wait for the precise instant or the revolution fails. Agency is renunciation and timing: he kneels, presses the compass, and leaves it as the revolution begins. Cost is visible: his impatience cools, his role ends, the coast will wake different. One beat of escalation (moon skews three degrees, pulse changes) plus the closure crystallization suffices for this length under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why engineers chose death—is signaled early and tightens when Mara finds Park's journal revealing the commissioner's threats. Her recognition of her father's parallel trajectory deepens the investigation from professional to personal. However, escalation is cerebral: she walks, examines, reads, realizes. No on-page opposition forces a trade-off; the climax is internal insight rather than a choice that narrows options. The resolution (filing the report, speaking truth) is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost or resistance. One meaningful tightening occurs but the final act lacks felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: repair the music box so Rowan can hear it before execution, an apology made action. Pressure tightens when Olya declares "I can give it beat, but I cannot give it mercy; that gear is missing," forcing Emil's hand to produce the evidence list—a meaningful choice that narrows his passive chaplain role into active truth-bearer. The cost is visible: candle fund spent, complicity in witnessing unchanged, and the acknowledgment that "time—though cracked—kept imperfect, courageous beat." One clear reversal (repair possible but insufficient → evidence delivery required) with agency driving the turn, though the execution hour looms mostly as backdrop pressure rather than live ticking constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—ring the bell no one hears yet—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The kaleidoscope jam and "Descend" command tighten options, forcing the buoy descent and climb. The discovery that the clapper is missing creates a reversal, and Juniper's arrow-tip strike resolves it through her own ingenuity (translation, not percussion). Visible cost appears: the arrow tip dulls, the buoy's gears slow, and Juniper commits to perpetual listening ("Keep evolving; I'll keep listening"). Agency is clear, though the Algorithm's coincidental "answer in pulses of steam" and the sunrise alignment feel slightly convenient. One meaningful tightening (descent, missing clapper, translation) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the Aurora cover-up and her mother's erasure—is signaled early via the forbidden folder and recurring 73s. Pressure accumulates through the hashtag auto-complete, the patch chord match, and the crystal's biometric bargain, but most turns arrive via discovery rather than protagonist-driven escalation under resistance. The keeper's lie to security is brief; the company's instant capitulation ("denial, then recall, then silence") deflates antagonistic pressure. The crystal bargain (open file, lose archive place) offers a clear trade-off with felt cost (name dimming, badge pixelating), and the final broadcast prevents refill of absence—one meaningful tightening that reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—map empathy onto action before the orchard forgets how to care—is signaled early and drives Mara's choices. Pressure tightens when the border thins and the ice threatens the lighthouse at dawn, forcing her mirror-entry. The swallowing of her own empathy ("terrifying and bright") is a clear escalation with embodied cost, and the confrontation with the Keeper narrows options (he dissolves, the harbor collapses). However, the revocation phrase and harbor-market rules arrive late without prior constraint or failed attempt, reducing the sense of earned agency. One meaningful deepening is present and scaled appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—learning "the sound of approaching endings"—is announced but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. The boy's reversal (not boarding) is triggered by recognition of a hum rather than Mara's agency, and no trade-off is dramatized on the page. The elders' weather reports and recipes appear as atmosphere rather than escalation. The piece deepens thematically across time-shards, but pressure does not cohere or tighten under the accumulative lens; instead it diffuses into summary ("years later") without a single on-page narrowing that alters Mara's options or knowledge in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to revive connection with Elena—emerges clearly. One meaningful tightening occurs: rediscovering the letter fragment prompts the decision to regraft vines and write a new note. However, no live opposition appears on the page; the conflict is entirely internal and reflective, with no external test or reversal. The cost (potential rejection, reopening old wounds) is conceptual and stated rather than viscerally dramatized, placing this in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom's echo before it dissipates—is signaled early. Pressure is asserted ("threatening to dissipate") but never dramatized as a live clock or reversible failure. The walker's three-perimeter walk and peripheral-awareness method proceed without complication, obstacle, or mistake. The conjured clearing "manifest[s]" on schedule; no tightening or trade-off narrows options. The ritual completes without visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—transmuting pain into shared beauty—is signaled early but never tested. The archivist faces no opposition, miscalculation, or meaningful tightening; each step (pinning photos, pressing the key) succeeds without friction. The workers' arrival validates her work without complication. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern breaks or resistance, but here the spiral forms smoothly and the town exhales on cue. No visible cost narrows her options or forces a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the pattern—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should read as density increase or cadence shift; here the sequences accumulate (laughter, cough, memories) but remain passive observation until Elara speaks. No tightening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; the library "answers" with a falling book, but this is coincidence, not protagonist agency. The resolution (she leaves, others will continue) lacks visible cost or tactical consequence. One meaningful pressure point is present but agency at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding "the sound of growing older"—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The accumulative pressure builds through the prophet's movement deeper into the garden, following driftwood markers to the cassette recorder, then hearing the frequency shift on the tape. The final beat offers a meaningful tightening: his realization that he's becoming the sound rather than merely searching for it forecloses the option of remaining a detached seeker. Under the accumulative lens, this provides sufficient escalation with a conceptual cost, though the prophet's agency remains more receptive than decisively active.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before the observatory collapses—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the floor trembles and Mira acts. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric; the choice to photograph and leave feels inevitable rather than a difficult trade-off. Agency is present but the cost is more implied than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: executing "a flawless goodbye" for Calderon. One tightening occurs when the monitor flatlines, forcing Mara to shift from comforting the living patient to ritually honoring the dead and guiding the daughter. The vinyl shard recurs with reweighted meaning (wrist → chest → daughter's hands), accumulating pressure. The final skybridge choice—pressing the reunited disk to her sternum—forecloses the illusion of seamless repair with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient escalation. No antagonist or reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation under the accumulative lens is gentle rather than tightening: Lyra's moves (setting rings, inserting key, winding backward) are sequential steps without visible friction or forced trade-offs. The reversal when her shadow waves goodbye and vanishes is evocative but does not narrow her options; she proceeds methodically. The cost of trading her shadow is declared in summary ("traded her wandering silhouette") rather than dramatized as a live choice with on-page hesitation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—how to reconcile a diagnostic mistake that nonetheless nurtured the village—is signaled early and tightens when the changeling offers the constellation map as a path to "set" errors rather than erase them. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara moves from paralyzed yearning ("rewind the reel") to active choice (placing the tooth). Agency is decision with visible cost: she accepts fractures as permanent guides, foreclosing the fantasy of correction. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final act reweights her stance on mistakes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire to ease village fear—is signaled early and holds through closure. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: polishing the glass, the mist reacting, the drop striking, the pearl condensing and dispersing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pearl's light scatters into the village, foreclosing Lira's solitary vigil and reweighting her relationship to the community. The cost is legible: the pearl dissolves, the glass becomes matte, and Lira's internal stillness replaces external longing. Agency is clear in her ritual choices and the decision to lift and release the pearl.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: grafting new meaning onto trauma after viral confession. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias offers the tablet, shifting Mira from passive witness to active creator of a second, quieter statement. The burial and separate departures foreclose the path of naming/connection, a visible cost. Pressure accumulates through imagery and cadence rather than reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is renunciation (refusing labels, choosing anonymity), which fits Earned Stasis logic within the broader Charged Poise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: complete the novel and redeem abandoned characters, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Lira's accusation ("You left me mid-knock") crystallizes the cost of evasion, and Mara's choice to offer the shell back narrows her options from hoarding to releasing. The reversal—wanting fragments to weigh her down—demonstrates agency under pressure. Cost is legible: she walks away "pockets empty" but writes through dawn. Escalation fits the Accumulative lens; no requirement for multiple turns at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—curing the daughter and valley children—is signaled early and sustained. The one-hour bloom window and harvest moon descent provide a ticking clock, but the ritual proceeds without friction or setback; Elara executes each verse without error or cost until the final release. The remedy's dispersal alters the valley's knowledge state, a meaningful change, but the escalation reads as ceremonial fulfillment rather than agency under pressure. No live option is foreclosed; the path is singular and successful.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake: translate heartbeats into a map that will lead him back to his lost lover. The stake is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens modestly: he searches, finds the plate, seals it with starlight (a deliberate, high-risk act under the silence constraint), and the orchard responds by beating in rhythm—but the climactic choice is to *not* follow the map, instead becoming its "keeper." That renunciation forecloses reunion with felt cost (he will never leave, never reach her). Agency is present but passive: he orchestrates the ritual, then accepts his role as guardian. The piece edges into the 8.0 band because the final stance crystallizes under accumulative pressure and the cost is legible, yet the turn from seeking-to-staying is more asserted than dramatized as an on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reversing time's theft—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through Ansel's nightly study and the cavern's responses, then tightens when he reassembles the timer in reverse and the boy-image releases the lost hours. The resolution is earned by his methodical reversal, not luck. However, the escalation is incremental rather than sharp; no live option is foreclosed mid-story, and the cost (sealing the timer, locking the cellar) is legible but not viscerally tested against a competing want. The stakes remain abstract (villages' clocks skip) rather than personally urgent for Ansel, limiting the felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—collect burdens to prevent the valley's collapse, but only by surrendering her own—is signaled early and tightens when the grotto resists and the flame sputters. The confession choice forecloses a path (she can no longer withhold the story) and the cost is visible (blood on the wick, the lamp left behind). However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on atmospheric pressure ("the silence itself grew heavy") rather than a series of choices that narrow options. The climactic turn feels more ritualistic than driven by protagonist agency testing alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: contain/express the memory of Emil's last performance with visible cost. The carving deepens Mara's engagement with grief, and the decision to carve the lion's face next (eyes open) forecloses avoidance, but the escalation is more textural accumulation than a tightening that narrows live options. The piece signals agency (she begins the cut, she will carve again), yet the turns are internal and gradual rather than pivotal choices under rising pressure. Cost is legible—she commits to facing the memory—but the price feels more thematic than tactically urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with the ghost to reconcile eroded ambitions—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the camera wheel clicks and the ghost's accusation, culminating in the shared reading of undeveloped squares. The protagonist's agency (mounting, speaking fragments, breaking the wheel) drives the tightening, and the cost (images dissolve, ghost stays) is legible on the page. However, the escalation lacks a felt reversal or narrowing of options; the ghost's presence and the wheel-breaking feel more like stations in a ritual than a contested choice under rising pressure. One meaningful deepening is present but the stakes remain largely internal and asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: resurrect hope via redirected flows. Pressure tightens when glycol reaches the fountain and the brass birds beat, a single meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present—Alya reroutes, welds, scratches equations—but the acts feel more procedural than fraught with competing goods or unavoidable harms. The spinning token and architect hologram add texture but do not narrow options with visible tradeoff. Cost is conceptual (reclaimed wonder) rather than a felt forfeiture that charges the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is clear early and tightens through the act of placing the clock and pendulum. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal: each reflection and gesture reweights the cost of letting go. Visible price: Arlen walks away with "emptiness he once feared," a path foreclosed. The middle leans reflective, slightly softening pressure, but the final ritual earns its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the father's lies—is signaled early and pursued through logbook translation, coordinate discovery, and journal retrieval. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial coordinate matches the log's erased margin. The climax journals deliver full confession without forcing Mara to synthesize partial clues or make a trade-off, slightly flattening the peak. The cost at closure (relinquishing the sundial, committing to a long mission) is visible but arrives quickly after discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve storm-corn choreography) is signaled early and sustained. Harbormaster's arrival forces one clear tightening: Ari hides the rope, cracks the bead, plants the seed in defiance—narrowing her options and charging the ending image. The planting forecloses secrecy with visible cost (public defiance, official notice). Fog's intervention at the escape beat softens agency slightly; luck assists rather than Ari's tactics alone. One meaningful escalation fits the length; cost is felt in the planted seed and the shoot's challenge to official maps.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The winding of the thread offers one beat of physical action, but no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off: she completes the work without obstacle, and the clients' transformations happen passively in her vision. The cost (her own past self as "last client") is conceptually interesting but lacks on-page consequence that alters her present tactics or future path beyond the assertion that her notebook is now empty.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: each assembly step (distilling moonlight, prying feather, rearranging pins) adds density and tightens the ritual. The egg's crack and the ribbon's escape constitute a meaningful turn that narrows options (beauty will not stay) and imposes conceptual cost (the palace falls). However, the prince's agency is curatorial rather than agonistic; no competing impulse or obstacle forces a trade-off. The final smile and hypothesis feel like acceptance rather than a choice with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ritual tightens through layered steps (trench, sand, coin, water), and the ending reconfigures the stake by shifting from sand to saplings. However, the escalation is textural rather than agonistic: no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid that alters tactics. The father's arson and Mara's firefighting career apply thematic pressure but do not dramatize a choice under opposing forces on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories from the stained glass box—is signaled early and pursued across four fountain beats. Yet each station replicates the same structure (breadcrumb → arrive → box reacts → memory appears → move on) without escalating pressure or forcing a trade-off until the fourth fountain, where Mara "opened the box fully." The memories "ask only to be seen," but no live option is foreclosed en route; Mara's agency is consistent pilgrimage rather than decision under competing costs. The ending delivers a visible price (empty box, dissolved memories, geese resume) that charges the final image, but the accumulative tightening is modest and late.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"share light without using fire"—is signaled early and tightens when the sharper echo arrives, forcing Kael off the path. The beacon discovery narrows options: he must marry past loss to future invitation or become another luminous bloom. Agency is enacted through the sonar-gear fusion, and the cost is visible: the generational crack seals, the gear goes quiet, and he becomes courier rather than exile. One meaningful tightening with a clear trade-off suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should deepen through layered density or a cadence shift that narrows options; instead, the story loops declarative insights ("understood the shape," "realized she had been retracing") without visible pressure or cost. The protagonist is passive, receiving information from the butterfly-grandmother rather than making choices that alter tactics. No tightening forecloses a path or forces a trade-off on the page, capping the score below mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restore balance vs. preserve the clock's debt-measuring function—is signaled in the opening third and tightens when the protagonist carves "r" to complete "forgive," then lashes the rake handle to alter time itself. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to add the final letter and compensate by winding the mainspring "arms burning," forcing the village to match "a farmer's contrition." The cost is unmistakable: the tower corrodes, the protagonist remains bound to the ritual "until then," and his burial beneath the field is foreshadowed. One meaningful tightening occurs when "absolution must be mutual; the tower demands a counterweight," narrowing options to physical intervention. Minor gap: the villagers' fear and the ridge's narrowing are told rather than shown eroding a specific field marker or tool.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: discover the shape of intentions. Pressure accumulates through clue-solving (coin, tapestry, map) but Mercy's agency reads more as receptive decoding than agonized choice. The tightening occurs when the hidden panel reveals the map, narrowing her path to one action: dig at the lamb's feet. Cost is present but conceptual—she becomes "the next keeper of the spiral"—rather than a visible forfeiture that alters tactics. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length, but the final turn feels mythic rather than motivated by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—"only one future could be written before dawn cracked the ice"—is signaled but never tested through meaningful tightening or reversal. The cartographer's actions (walking, listening, writing mid-air) unfold as ritual without escalation; no live option is foreclosed by her choices. Dawn's arrival functions as scenic backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows tactics. The sacrifice of memories ("first, the taste of summer peaches; then, her mother's voice; finally, her own name") is a descent checklist without visible cost that alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring narrative after the story famine—is clear and tightens when Mila learns the broadcaster will sign off after the solstice, giving her "one chance to amplify the dust." The escalation is tactical (nightly copying → rosin ink → copper filament → transmission) and culminates in the inspectors' transformation. Cost is visible: Mila does not flee and accepts capture, and the broadcaster's frequency falls silent. However, the inspectors' conversion feels convenient rather than hard-won; no prior beat shows them wavering or vulnerable to the chord's effect, so the climax lacks earned friction. The tightening is meaningful but the resolution lands softer than the accumulative pressure warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Elena's need to tell/complete her grandmother's fragmented story through art installation. The story provides one meaningful deepening through accumulation—each act of positioning, scattering, adjusting the mask layers additional understanding onto "incomplete information" as method and theme. However, no reversal or choice-point forces Elena to relinquish a path or make a trade-off with felt consequence; the installation proceeds as planned without opposition or internal conflict testing her commitment. The cost arrives conceptually at closure ("arrives too late to change anything") but Elena's agency throughout is execution rather than decision under competing pressures. The steady accumulation fits Accumulative lens but lacks the tightening that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving truth against denial—is signaled early and sustained. The burial-sump discovery tightens her method (creating the counter-narrative stylus), but this feels more like procedural progression than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The final public utterance introduces social risk (crowd recoil), yet we don't see her weigh silence versus speech in a dramatized beat. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase is present, but the escalation lacks a single moment where pressure narrows her tactics or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unlearning hatred to restore harmony—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence (rosette drinking lamplight, collecting syllables, singing the scale, hearing the city's heartbeat rearrange), but the escalation is textural rather than decisional; Mara does not face a live dilemma or trade-off that narrows her options on the page. The cost (her voice as sacrifice, the rosette crumbling, her lifelong silence) is legible in the final third, yet because no on-page choice forces her to weigh competing goods or endure visible friction, the tightening feels decorative rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—gentle rebellion to "rewire the collective tongue"—is signaled early and tightens when the alignment peaks, forcing the seven-breath window. One meaningful escalation occurs when the seed sprouts and releases memory-scents that drift into the city, altering strangers' synapses. The workers' tasting at dawn provides visible cost (guard weeps, bureaucrat laughs, officers disarmed). Agency is present but the ease of success (no meaningful opposition, Ministry arrives only after she's gone) reduces pressure; coincidence aids rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against routine's erosion—is signaled early and the riddle mechanism provides one meaningful tightening that forces Mara to speak a lie, narrowing her options under the Accumulative lens. The lightning strike and coin transformation deliver a felt cost (she abandons her post, waives the toll, leaves the gate open) and reweight prior material. However, the boy's arrival and the riddle's origin (the queen) are coincidental gifts rather than protagonist-driven escalation; Mara reacts and completes a puzzle rather than forging the turn herself, which limits agency at the inciting and midpoint beats.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive and restoring their balance—is signaled early and tightens when the double-exposure vision teaches the displacement rule. The compass discovery and ritual constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows her mission and forecloses aimless noticing. Agency is present in the gathering and sanctification, yet the escalation is smooth rather than contested; no genuine obstacle or competing pressure tests her commitment. The houses' sigh and her refined covenant at road's end deliver resolution, but the visible price—leaving the compass needle-less, accepting incompleteness—is more conceptual than visceral. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern of arrhythmia → ritual → unison exhale works, but the lack of friction or misstep keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake clear early: whether to break the ampoule and release suppressed truth. Pressure tightens through one meaningful turn—the narrator must choose between preserving the "museum of certainties" or welcoming transformation with its cost (admitting the court's betrayal, dissolving its own stone certainty). Agency is deliberate: "With deliberate gentleness I cracked its neck." Cost is on-page and visible: stone skin softens, calcified certainty sheds, the sentinel role transforms to welcomer/waiter. The surrounding statues' awakenings (dolphin weeps, lovers recall sculptor's regret) add secondary pressure. No coincidence resolves; the protagonist's action drives the cascade. Minor note: the gardener's urging provides motivation but risks slight convenience in directing the narrator to the exact structural weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake signaled early: capture the texture of a missed opportunity, operationalized as endless climbing. One meaningful tightening: the chipped die balancing on edge triggers recognition, panic when the stairs slow, then the blood sigma restarts motion—each forecloses an option. The final renunciation (not stepping through, rolling dice into ripple) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: staircase convulses, begins to forget her. Minor issue: the hand "reaching back" introduces a responsive agent late without prior setup, softening the price slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: complete the mural and release lost languages into the neighborhood. No on-page obstacle or competing pressure tests this goal; Mira paints uninterrupted, the visions pour out, Jules arrives and cooperates without friction. The wind rattles panes but does not threaten loss. Escalation reads as accumulation of imagery rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The ending's cost—Mira's fatigue, the languages carried seedlike—remains atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is signaled early and undergoes meaningful reversal when the old woman reframes who is rescuing whom. This tightening forces Aurelia to abandon passive documentation for active participation with visible cost (professional identity, cultured distance). The Chen family's kitchen takeover escalates pressure by demonstrating survival without external rescue. Agency is clear: Aurelia's choice to photograph for distribution rather than display, then to pick up dough, forecloses her curator role. The constraint that the beekeeper never returns and ice bridges have melted shapes the community's—and Aurelia's—tactics toward self-sufficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (escape prophecy) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the yoyo reaches cord's end and two futures appear, forcing a choice. However, escalation feels more additive (each yoyo trick loosens a brick) than narrowing; the protagonist's agency is mechanical execution rather than agonizing trade-offs. The cost (loss of gift) is legible but arrives as information rather than felt sacrifice. Coincidence (the yoyo being the exact missing piece) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and pursued through symbolic action: entering the funhouse, pinning the photo, walking the bleed corridor. Pressure accumulates via textural density rather than reversals; the protagonist's agency is consistent but largely ritual. The final act (kneeling, offering the clasp and note) forecloses the path of avoidance, though the cost is more emotional resolution than a visible price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child accepts the note and the clasp falls, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than decision-driven. Fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: move the raft through the Doldrum Wall using sound. The prophet's agency drives escalation: sketching resonance → dubbing loops → rigging the rotating crown. The Wall's stillness raises cost (engines fail, laughter falls flat), and the final turn—children dancing, cyclone eye opening—is earned by prior sonic layering. The tightening is meaningful but cost remains largely instrumental (effort, rigging) rather than a visible personal or relational price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (charting the watchers to prevent the city from tumbling into the Crack) is signaled early and tightens when Grand Akmon shudders. The cartographer's agency drives escalation: she chooses to alter the note, persist through seven iterations despite merchant screams, and plays the final sequence as a question. The watchers' response and the glimpse of her mother create a reversal that forces the final choice. Cost is visible: she must guide future wanderers toward the crack, carrying "sunwashed dread and her new, terrible chart." Minor gap: the turtles' understanding and turnaround feel slightly convenient, though the subsonic-rumble detail grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—expose the forged letter to rescue truth—is signaled early and coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the watchman's torch forces Elara onto the semaphore arm, narrowing her escape options. Agency is decision (taking the letter) and evasion, but the cost remains largely projected ("scholars would argue, citizens would doubt") rather than paid on the page. No visible trade-off or loss alters her tactics after the retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion while smuggling personal memory into its repairs—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's three stages (fissure, altar, dome), each location accepting a deeper confession. The scheduled tide and engineers' expectation create external constraint, though no on-page moment dramatizes a conflict between her official duty and her clandestine method. The final ascent forecloses the ritual (she caps the inkwell "lighter by exactly the amount of a confession") with visible symbolic cost, and her decision to walk without looking back completes the renunciation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the dome inscription written directly on stone) is sufficient, but the absence of a live choice between competing goods holds the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: trace the catalogue's honest origins before digitization erases them. One meaningful tightening when Mara extinguishes the lantern and discovers the glyph mirrors the sunken city's original street grid, narrowing her options to either comply or resist. The final choice to rewrite the index with "Pre-Submergence Topography" forecloses the path of passive complicity with visible cost: she must carry private knowledge against civic myth. Agency is clear; coincidence (blackout, phosphorescence) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming the daughter's final dream into goodbye—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual: each fold is "a day she arrived too late," each tuck "a promise that dissolved." The maker's agency is embodied in breathing the dream into her lungs and pinching it into paper, with visible cost: the moonstone crumbles, engines darken, and her own dream (where her daughter does not fall) is spent to light the stolen leaf. The descent-ascent paradox and the threshold crossing force renunciation with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cranes become "living lanterns...for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye," converting private grief into communal resource.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding and harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and tightens when he realizes he's "turning tragedy into a resource" rather than saving anyone. One clear reversal: the hunt shifts from rescue fantasy to mechanical grief. The final choice is protagonist-driven with visible cost: his death will save a village by altering the telescope .003 degrees. Each fragment crumbled from the geode narrows options, and the escalation culminates in self-sacrifice with tactical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the frequency of belonging and locating her missing parents—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The lever-pull beat tightens pressure momentarily ("her hands found the cold iron"), and the star-map's revelation shifts Mara's knowledge. Yet the escalation is thin: no meaningful opposition, no cost trade-off, no path foreclosed. The pilgrim offers the press freely, Mara pulls the lever without hesitation or sacrifice, and the frequencies arrive as a gift rather than a choice under duress, flattening the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias must choose whether to confess the truth to his dying mother. The pressure tightens meaningfully when he recognizes her as his own client, then deepens when he finds the carved portrait that embodies integrity. The mother's pre-knowledge slightly softens the peak cost—she grants him permission rather than forcing a harder breach—but the resolution still forecloses his fifteen-year pattern of false genealogies with visible relational and professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—untethering Princess Seris without either crown claiming victory—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through Kael's moon-phase timing, the guards' shared fear-naming, and the rope ritual. One meaningful escalation occurs when the herald steps forward to recite crimes and Kael raises a hand, timing the pause "with the moon's secret pulse," forcing both sides into vulnerability rather than ledger-keeping. The resolution is earned by Kael's agency (returning the pull to Seris, orchestrating the ritual), and the cost is visible: his pocket lighter, heart heavier, "the weight of recycled mistakes settling into bone." The price—giving up the talisman and accepting the ember of responsibility—forecloses the path of carried regret.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaim navigation ability / align heart and action) is signaled early and tightens through the pole-by-pole progression. The compass-gash moment provides one meaningful reversal that transforms the instrument from failed guide to hindrance requiring release. Agency manifests in the turn toward pole two despite chart warnings, and the final paddle into open water with broken compass still present represents earned stance crystallization. Cost is legible: she forecloses certainty and must navigate without instruments. The dolphin arrival slightly weakens escalation by providing convenient aid rather than forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—kindle empathy by reclaiming memory—is signaled early and tightens when the lake offers its bargain. The wading choice forecloses hollow existence with visible cost: nausea, skipped heartbeat, borrowed rhythms. Agency is clear in stepping forward and calling out. The silhouettes joining hands deepens the circuit, diluting pain collectively. One meaningful tightening occurs at the shore; no requirement for multiple reversals. The conceptual stakes (redemption as turnstile) feel weighty, though the emotional price is more asserted than shown through micro-gestures of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (reforge bond beyond death) and one meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator learns one must die into the other's form. However, the escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than pressure-driven choice: no visible attempt fails or forces a trade-off on the page. The step into the circle and inhalation of shadow feel inevitable by mood rather than tested by a prior setback. Cost is legible (merger forecloses separate existence) but agency in the peak moment is passive—surrender rather than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost time and confronting the daughter's absence—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than agentic: the protagonist kneels, spreads cards, reads, traces the name, and speaks it aloud, but none of these acts narrow options or force a visible trade-off. The cloud descends on its own; the crack heals itself; time floods back without the cartomancer relinquishing a concrete resource or foreclosing a path. The final act of speaking the name and inviting the night to tea reads as acceptance with implied cost (she will carry this forever) but lacks the on-page price or tightening typical of 7.0+ under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or internal conflict. No on-page reversal narrows options; the gravity spinner responds to declared happiness without dramatized cost. The ten billion deaths function as cosmic background rather than pressure that shapes Sister Halcyon's choices. The sail completes, joy floods, the door opens—linear wish-fulfillment with no trade-off or tactic shift forced by resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Kael's search for purpose through transformation—is signaled early but remains abstract. The mountain's cooperation (path uncovering, lava cooling into stairs) and the bugs' orchestrated coincidences resolve obstacles without forcing Kael to make a costly trade-off. The cave immersion offers a texture deepening, but no on-page reversal narrows options or demands visible sacrifice. Escalation reads as pattern accumulation rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—spark a silent revolution before dawn—is signaled early and pressure coheres through the blackout window. One meaningful tightening occurs when Voss storms in and Garnet must improvise a false surge report, narrowing options. The resolution, however, relies on off-stage mechanics: Luce's chain-room work is summarized, the timer triggers relays without friction, and barges drift free as planned. Agency at closure is gestural (dropping the mask, whispering to the wind) rather than a decision with visible trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve, but convenience does—no sentries intervene, no unforeseen cost materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns to fulfill a promise—is signaled early but remains abstract. Escalation under the Hybrid lens should show accumulation that reweights cost; instead, rock placement proceeds without reversal or visible complication. The precognitive curse forecloses agency: Elias "saw himself placing" the rocks, so the sequence is witnessed rather than fought for. One micro turn occurs when the star dust begins to sing (ninth rock), but this is a coincidence that unlocks resolution rather than a choice that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing, yet the price Elias pays—gathering "the empty pouch"—lacks the felt weight required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—archiving forbidden verse by dissolving it into storm and starlight—is signaled early and pursued through the darkroom ritual. The overexposure accident ("an accident she would later call revelation") offers a micro-turn that shifts tactics from clandestine printing to metaphorical broadcast, and the timer stopped at one second crystallizes the vigil-in-pause motif. However, the escalation lacks a visible price that narrows options; Mara's choices feel preordained rather than forced by constraint. The dissolution of the manuscript carries conceptual cost but no dramatized trade-off or tactical friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding the sundial to unlock a hidden inquiry—is signaled early and tightens when Vale reveals the brook clue. The philosophical duel provides texture but doesn't escalate options; the scholars watch passively. The chime signals acceptance, but no prior attempt was refused, so the arrival feels granted rather than won. Cost at closure is conceptual (rivalry ended) but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the library against bulldozing—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual of burning past selves and the shared rebuilding. The Rourke confrontation offers a pressure point, but it resolves via verbal maneuvering ("recommend preservation for educational credit") rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The accumulative lens supports thematic intensification, yet the final image projects future action ("will return," "will rebuild") rather than crystallizing present consequence. One meaningful deepening is present, but cost clarity at closure is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue waiting or move forward—is signaled early and tightens once when the pianist trades the clock's chime for entry into the loop, then again when she chooses to leave. The tidal arbor and film mechanics complicate the situation but do not escalate through protagonist agency; instead, the arbor "responds" and fog "dissolves the boundary" without clear causal linkage to her actions. The final departure forecloses the loop's safety with felt cost, meeting the Accumulative lens requirement for a meaningful deepening. However, coincidence (the hatch's discovery, the projectionist's offer) drives key turns more than the pianist's active choices under pressure, and the middle section's reversals feel more symbolic than tactically constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—save the ridge or lose the Aya's cultural memory—is signaled early and tightens via the pre-monsoon clock and the dream-fissure discovery. Escalation is causal: Calyx's choice to plant the seed narrows options (she loses her teacher's name) and the instructions force a tactical pivot (weave doubt, not certainty). The resolution is earned by her agency with visible cost on the page. One weakness: the cartographers' erosion claim versus collective-memory solidity is declared but never tested through an on-page reversal or complication that dramatizes the contradiction before the dream sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—diffusing the ache and learning the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens through three instruction beats that narrow options (trace, untie, exhale). The compass needle's slowing and the color's shift from bruise-blue to dawn tint register escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the narrator must remain silent at the dock, and the apology becomes a permanent pattern held by the tree rather than spoken. Agency is constrained by the ritual's passivity—Kaede orchestrates, the narrator obeys—which prevents deeper engagement.

    Dominant stake—appraising the truth about the ghost shift—is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the Hybrid lens, from investigating to unscrewing the wheel. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional shift and the wheel's stillness, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence, driven by protagonist choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of witnessing vs. interfering escalates under accumulative lens through density increases (e.g., path deepening, swan unfolding). Protagonist agency drives escalation—keeper's decision to become the swan forecloses options with cost (loss of self). Cost is unmistakable in "memories flatten, ink draining," and tension operates at sentence and story scales.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency: Elara's decision to navigate by poles despite shoals tightens options, and the cost is legible in the compass cutting her and the acceptance of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes are internal and conceptual—whether Mara can reframe catastrophe and her own grief—but they’re clearly signaled and deepened through the experiment’s progress and the approaching storm. Escalation reads as density of data and pattern recognition rather than dramatic reversals, culminating in the 03:17 convergence and her subsequent shift in attitude toward storms and drama. The external danger (another storm, failing lights, collapsing panes) adds texture but doesn’t decisively constrain her tactics or force a hard trade-off. Strong for a quiet piece, but the conflict could feel sharper if one concrete option (e.g., evacuate vs finish run) were more visibly foreclosed with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what she chooses to do with survival and complicity after the arson—is signaled early and sharpened at the ash-ring camp where she realizes other glass artists have been used and silenced. There is a clear tightening when she reaches the smugglers’ schism site; from there, the key reversal is her decision not to continue the route but to step off it. The internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, but the on-page sense of jeopardy or sacrifice is relatively gentle; there’s little concrete pressure pushing her toward continuing the dangerous path. The ending choice is nonetheless credibly earned and reconfigures her options with a believable, if quietly rendered, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal and artistic: whether Mara can discover a meaningful way to communicate in a world without sound and thus reframe her trauma. Pressure escalates accumulatively as she moves from testing a single fork to orchestrating a full thermal symphony and building a new notation system. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (abandoning the fantasy of restoring old sound, reorienting her identity), not sharply dramatized as a sacrifice. The conflict is thus rich but somewhat low-simmer rather than sharply tightening around a visible dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—relieving the burden of unmoored souls versus preserving his own separate life—clarifies early and tightens as he realizes the lens is damaged and the dead are “overdue fines.” His decision to tear pages from “Perpetual Repose” and burn them as an offering is a meaningful escalation, trading memory and names he’s tended for the chance to restore the signal. The final tethering by the brass octopus and his acceptance of tenure foreclose his prior existence with credible cost. The only slight limitation is that his acceptance comes smoothly; an extra beat of resistance under that pressure could deepen the felt conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pressure is steady and coherent: scarcity, surveillance, and the detained mother create a concrete external threat, while Mara’s need to extend support across generations deepens the internal conflict. The baby formula in the false-bottom cart and Lita’s warning about tightening sanctions are effective escalations. The major tightening is Mara’s decision to start the second ledger and to increase run frequency rather than portions, trading convenience and safety for resilience. The story remains more tensional than overtly suspenseful, but within its quiet mode the stakes feel real.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transmute “unused love” before it calcifies—is clear, and it tightens when the man appears and mirrors her fracture, turning a private quest into a shared risk. The key deepening comes when the breathing work with the bead reveals the wisteria door and the orchard of withheld kindness, forcing them to literally bite into their own avoided apologies. However, the process from encounter to healing stays relatively frictionless; there’s little on-page resistance or possibility of failure once the ritual starts, which softens the sense of price paid. The cost is more conceptual than agonized, which fits the mode but limits escalatory bite.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether she will escape/stand outside time or accept living within its losses—intensifies as the maze deepens and solidifies at the door. The main escalation comes from the revelation of the hawthorn’s film-rings and the disintegration/straightening of the maze, which concretizes the cost of tearing a ring free. Her final choice to seal the hourglass rather than cross the threshold is clearly a renunciation with visible cost and consequence. Because the conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, pressure is more contemplative than harrowing, but it does tighten appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving and accessing the seed vault without prematurely collapsing the wall—is clear early and drives all conflict. Escalation is well-handled: approaching guards plus ticking artillery create a meaningful tightening, and her choice to impede without firing a shot both raises risk and narrows options. The external conflict with guards is brisk but effective, and the internal tension between immediate violence and long-game protection is implicitly dramatized. The main limiter is that the confrontation resolves smoothly, with minimal sense of possible failure once she commits to the chain-arrow ruse.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to capture and understand the sound of her brother’s betrayal—arrives early and tightens around the forge sequence. Pressure escalates as she chooses to sacrifice the only thing she has left of him and then discovers the sound includes her own complicity, reweighting her goal. Agency is evident in the key decisions (feeding the forge, pressing her ear to the iron, choosing how to use the shard afterward), and the emotional cost of those choices is legible. The arc is more inwardly deepening than externally contested, so tension stays mostly emotional/lyric rather than sharply conflictual, which slightly softens the sense of “must not fail” stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the thief will damage the world further to satisfy a client’s desperate wish—is signaled well and tightened when the prior erasure is revealed via the ring inscription. The moral dilemma is strong in concept, and the realization that the woman is trying to undo her own commissioned erasure deepens the pressure. However, the internal battle at the peak—deciding not to cut another portrait but to recombine what she already has—reads as relatively smooth; we don’t feel her truly tempted or cornered. Escalation is thus more intellectual than visceral, effective but shy of maximal intensity for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether Mara will remain locked in avoidance or risk emotional thaw by creating and then relinquishing a sanctuary—is clear and tightened as she invests more of herself in the dome. Escalation is quiet but effective: the growing fire, loud roof collapse, and increasingly intimate narration of her acts ratchet pressure until she must choose whether to keep or leave the dome. The choice to abandon her original plan is an earned renunciation with a felt cost, even if the harm is wholly internal. The only limit is that external pressures remain minimal; the story leans almost entirely on interior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early—without proof of being more than “expendable muscle,” his identity and livelihood vanish when digital doubles replace him. Pressure escalates from internal dread and search tension to the concrete arrival of guards, forcing Leo to choose between flight and an exposed, improvisational stand. His projector outwitting is a meaningful tightening: he leverages his fear rather than suppressing it, which forecloses the option of remaining safely invisible. The cost and trade-off are visible, though we only glimpse the consequences prospectively (“tomorrow I would leak…”).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—completing a true map of endless night before the last star dies—is clear and tightened by the diminishing star and thickening hush. Pressure escalates as the booklet grows heavier, the star contracts into a “pupil,” and the hush becomes a medium she must physically dip her quill into, culminating in the threshold drawing and self-sacrifice. Agency is strong at the end: she chooses to finish the map under cost and to step into her outline, foreclosing any path where she remains a mere observer. The conflict remains largely conceptual and internal, so the tension is profound but quiet rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical: J4N-17’s curiosity/obsession versus the enforced loop and opaque Program purpose. Escalation is modest; we’re told stakes increase (“motivation… had grown from curiosity into obsession”), but on-page pressure doesn’t significantly tighten beyond the countdown to the violin’s sound. The main turning point—touching/playing the violin and integrating 373 loops into a new understanding—does reweight the situation, but doesn’t clearly foreclose any path or demand a hard trade-off. The resulting tension feels contemplative rather than urgent, which limits the sense of high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether mistrust among staff will remain frozen or be thawed—is clear and tracked through the ticket, the missing lens, and the overheard conversation. Pressure coherently tightens when Mira has to choose between public confrontation and a more merciful, symbolic act via the film projection. Escalation is mostly internal and quiet, so the emotional cost is felt but not jagged; the conflict resolves without serious risk of material loss on the page. The result is satisfying but a little gentle for top-tier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s relationship to luck, control, and the garden’s will—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the 0.03% score is answered by the garden’s impossible generosity. The apple and later the glove function as escalations in knowledge, reweighting her sense of agency. However, the conflict remains nearly frictionless: she never faces a difficult trade-off, risk, or loss, and the “worst luck day” brings only positive outcomes. As a result, tension is more contemplative than pressurized, limiting stakes clarity and escalation at the high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—prove sideways time by altering her younger choice vs. accept her entangled identity with the station—is clear and escalates when she engages the lever and witnesses alternative futures. The moth-bats’ interference patterns and the chrysalis metaphor sharpen the pressure, reframing her experiment as a forced awakening with potential harm. The final choice (not to pull the lever tomorrow, to wait for the “ripe” moment) credibly narrows options and carries a conceptual/emotional price. Stakes remain largely internal and cerebral, but they are coherent and scaled appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether he will remain an invisible pit musician or accept the ghost’s disruptive, liminal “voice,” and the story does escalate from eerie appearances to a decisive choice at the hidden door. Yet almost all opposition is absent: the water parts for him, the ghost is purely benevolent, and there’s no serious competing obligation or danger. As a result, the choice to accept the gift lacks sharp trade-off or loss, undercutting the sense of cost. The conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can survive and ethically manage the “last unspoken fact” she carries—is clear early and tightens credibly as the internal weight becomes physical pain. Escalation is well handled: repetition of “heavier,” distorted laurel sketches, rootlets piercing her diaphragm, and the aurora’s intensification all increase pressure. Her choice to go outside, erase the illustration, and finally expel the stone enacts an earned sacrifice that forecloses the option of keeping the world’s forgetting intact. The only modest limitation is that external stakes for the valley remain conceptual rather than tested in a concrete on-page threat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the ghost shift will remain trapped in repetition and whether Mara can bear the true weight of what happened—is clearly signaled and coherently pressured. Tension escalates from eerie atmosphere and remembered psychic warnings to the concrete risk of engaging with the wheel and directly addressing the ghost shift. The decisive tightening comes when she unscrews the cap and offers herself as “weight” and “witness,” foreclosing the option of remaining a distant skeptic. The main cost is internal and ethical rather than physical, but it reads as a real trade-off between protective distance and implicated presence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the keeper remains a witness or surrenders herself to sustain the library’s regenerative silence—is signaled and does meaningfully tighten at the lectern when the book reveals her role. Internal and external pressures interweave (her past failed intervention vs. the library’s self-erasing rules), and stepping onto the mirror-water is a clear, costly choice. Still, tension rises more through intensifying imagery than through sharply escalating dilemma, and her acceptance comes almost too smoothly, with limited on-page resistance or competing desire to heighten the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving or reawakening ordinary magic in children before it’s eroded by screens—is established early and tightened by the eclipse’s narrow window. However, conflict remains mostly one-sided: there is little concrete opposition beyond the abstract encroachment of technology and the fragility of the ritual itself. The key “escalation” beat is the whistle nearly failing and Elara steadying it with the baby curl, which is effective but very brief. As a result, pressure feels more meditative than sharply escalating, strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she will realign the world’s “axis” by joining dragon-tapestry, diaries, and silo—is clear and coherently pressured through accumulating revelations. Each diary tightens the frame, converting curiosity into a consequential choice to enact the ritual and accept its implications. The cost (loss of the tapestry’s image, her former solitude, and static observer status) is legible, though the story leans heavily on conceptual rather than visceral tension. Slightly more foregrounded risk or potential failure at the moment she lays the tapestry down could sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Chen remains as rock-bound oracle/spy or orchestrates his own disappearance—is clear and sharpened when his fortune to the keeper recoils back onto him. Pressure escalates as the prophetic line sinks in, turning the island from asset to consuming presence, and culminates in his decision to leave via skiff. However, conflict stays primarily internal and contemplative; the world will “forget him” is a soft, long-horizon threat, and no immediate counterforce (political, physical, relational) presses him hard in the moment. The result is thematically satisfying but a touch low on concrete jeopardy or wrenching trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether the demon will possess the congregation—is clear and sharpened by the ticking condition “before the possession completes.” Pressure escalates through increasingly complex loops, the introduction of the ultraviolet color, and finally the priest’s choice to step into the loop and become the new anchor. The cost is real and visible, but tension remains more intellectual and symbolic than visceral, which slightly blunts the sense of danger moment to moment. Still, the escalation is purposeful and the resolution is earned by the priest’s specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—turning chronological homesickness into a home through composition before physical collapse—is clear and under real time pressure (“thirty minutes before exhaustion hit,” then “Fifteen minutes left”). Escalation is well handled via the sequence of memories and the shift into movements; the live clock tightens options and culminates in exhaustion hitting right after completion. The cost is legible: physical depletion and the relinquishing of the nautilus. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and unopposed by any counter-force beyond fatigue, which keeps the pressure from reaching the highest possible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will remain trapped in proliferating self-iterations or pay to erase the “minotaur” of his own choices—is clear and escalates coherently. Pressure tightens through the algorithm’s hiccup, the slicing rain/time, the fork into seventeen arches, and the confrontation with elder Kael, culminating in the costly act of smashing the tablet and stepping into “nothing.” Internal and external conflicts interweave, though the danger is more metaphysical than visceral, leaving some emotional distance from the cost. The escalation is strong and earned but feels more conceptual than bodily, which slightly mutes the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—Mara’s fight against emotional numbness—is clearly signaled early and escalates as she chooses increasingly risky intimacy with memory (repairing the fragile needle, spinning the backward lullaby, accepting the flood of sensation). Pressure builds texturally rather than through overt reversals, but the tightening is clear: once the record starts, she must endure its progression, and the “filament of hush” thins toward a final confrontation with grief. The cost—having to fully feel her sister’s death—is explicit and lands inside the climax, not waved away. The conflict remains mostly internal and quiet, which slightly limits perceived jeopardy but suits the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will collude in sanitizing reality or risk herself to preserve uncensored storms—is clear and escalates as she discovers the forged “future” message and the quarantine’s true purpose. Her choice to go lateral, exploit the pigeon system, and ultimately stay underground is active, not passive, and meaningfully forecloses the path of compliant ascent. Internal and external conflicts intertwine well, though the external threat (the follower, institutional enforcement) remains more implied than viscerally dramatized, which dampens immediate tension slightly. Still, the ethical price and narrowing of options read as real.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will risk smelling Lira’s perfume and be undone—is clear early (“aromatically cautious, afraid that one wrong inhalation would loose the sob”). Pressure tightens as he moves from cautious observation to uncapping, then to altering the orchid, each step committing him further. The main “reversal” is internal: from resisting understanding to accepting a painful insight about scent and tears, then choosing a life aligned with that risk. Stakes are intensely intimate rather than large-scale, but the emotional price is legible and proportional to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—transcend vs remain embodied—is clear and thematically potent, with the energy beings’ offer and Marcus’s escape establishing real stakes. Pressure does deepen as the narrator moves from observing (rope, impressions) to sitting where Marcus sat and then facing the beings’ silent question. However, escalation remains largely internal and meditative; there’s little sense of time pressure, danger, or irrevocability beyond implication. The final decision reads as weighty but not sharply tested by external opposition in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can transform inherited instruments of survival (the bowl, the music) into a new, unfinished form without audience or coin—is clear and coherently followed. Escalation is quiet but real: from tentative planting and single harmonic to constructing the wire bridge and playing through the night, each step intensifies her commitment and the environment’s response. She forecloses the path of performance-as-mendicancy and tidy cadences by leaving the bowl behind and refusing resolution, a choice that costs her conventional closure and communal validation. The conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, not combative, which keeps the stakes intimate rather than sharply oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will risk being overwhelmed by authentic, others’ emotions and what it will cost her—is clear and followed through. Pressure escalates as she moves from hesitation to ingestion to collapse under the weight of borrowed grief, rage, and wonder. The key tightening is her acceptance of the transformation’s consequences instead of resisting or bargaining them away. The conflict is almost entirely internal, so the piece lacks hard reversals, but the deepening is credible and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is ethical and emotional—how Marisol will handle this unexpected opportunity to continue a legacy of anonymous compassion. There is one real tightening when the “fictional” Wharf of the Lanterns turns out to host only a single NGO vessel, forcing reinterpretation rather than abandonment. However, the external conflict is extremely soft: no resistance to delivering funds, no serious threat or dilemma beyond logistics and meaning-making. As a result, pressure grows more in texture than in cost, keeping the piece from higher bands on conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can move from isolation into chosen kinship—is clearly established, and the shared search for the heron tag provides an external spine that steadily narrows focus. Pressure escalates through her initial inability to dedicate, the long, uncertain hunt, and the eventual overwhelming vision of the lattice of faces. Her climactic actions (accepting the net of connection and choosing to go “deeper than anyone has gone”) are earned and foreclose her prior solitary trajectory. Still, conflict remains relatively gentle and contemplative, with little sense of real risk beyond emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s chance to reach the birthplace of echoes within a single, distorted hour—is signaled early and tightened by the explicit price at the aviary. The key escalation is the choice to repay all borrowed time, trading future life minutes for access to the echoes she seeks. Internal and external stakes (grief vs. survival time) interweave well, though the emotional wrestling with that trade could be slightly more fraught on the page. The resolution flows from her values and feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to move within ambiguous loss, embodied in reviving the orchard—is established early and tightens as each ritual step either fails or partially unlocks something. The key deepening turn is the drop hitting the right eye, triggering the mosaic’s opening and escalating the narrator’s commitment. The conflict is primarily internal but externalized through concrete magical tasks, and the final act of sealing the astrolabe rather than clinging to it reads as an earned stance. Stakes do stay somewhat conceptual, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elias remains an invisible custodian or risks exposure to give the girl the voices—are clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure escalates as he moves from guarding caches to systematically releasing them, culminating in the self-revealing final tape. However, the cost of visibility (what he fears losing) is only lightly implied, so the internal conflict doesn’t bite as hard as it could. The tension is strong but not maximally sharpened for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to control and understand the plants versus being subsumed into their logic—is clear and escalates from anomalous observation to physical transformation to surrender. The tightest pressure comes when the leaf syncs with her pulse and pain blooms; her options narrow rapidly as her body changes and the plants’ “collective consciousness” presses in. The ultimate “choice” is more a surrender/endurance than an active strategic decision, but it does foreclose her prior life with a visible cost. The shift to an almost mythic epilogue slightly flattens the visceral edge of that cost, keeping stakes more conceptual than gut-level at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—Mara’s need to derive meaning and create art that answers the water-warped world—is clear from the outset and does evolve through the encounter and painting session. Pressure escalates gently rather than sharply: the brooch’s response, the old woman’s challenge to “paint what the water revealed,” and the act of painting feverishly with rainwater do deepen the conflict between exhaustion and creative compulsion. However, the story largely sidesteps tangible risk or hard trade-offs; there’s little sense that she might fail in a way that costs her more than pride. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won, keeping tension at a contemplative level.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and at what cost everyday magic will be magnified into the wider world—is clear, with the tension focused on the transfer of sight and its irreversible consequences. Escalation is mostly smooth and lyric rather than sharply pressured: he follows, accepts each instruction, undergoes the ritual, then tries once (briefly) to return the gift before the cave forecloses that option. The cost to the seer (erosion into mineral song, narrowed futures) reads, but his agency is minimal—he rarely chooses between live, conflicting options. As a result, conflict feels more like a solemn sacrament than a contested struggle, effective but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will accept the task of heartening a city complicit in his erasure—is clear early and tightened through the quest to reassemble the trumpet. Escalation is modest but present: first acquiring the valve’s body, then needing the mouthpiece, then persuading someone who has her own trauma-bound claim to it. The main cost is emotional and ethical, especially in the cemetery negotiation, rather than materially dire, so tension stays at a contemplative burn. Still, the final choice to act (blow the note) convincingly crystallizes his stance toward exile and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Alden will continue numbing himself with dead maps or risk speaking his truths—is present early and escalates well. Pressure tightens as the punch begins erasing lies from his past and culminates in the fortress of suppressed artifacts, forcing a concrete choice (board the carriage and confess or retreat). His decision to use the punch on his own chest, then to paint instead of map, is a clear, agency-driven turn that forecloses the old path. The conflict is largely internal and metaphorical, but it maintains coherence and doesn’t feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Mara can stay in the comfort of analytic detachment or risk full participation in entangled memory and feeling—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals: the forced memory influx, the porous tower walls, the tile levitating, and finally the whale response and her decision to leave the tile and follow. Agency at the end is strong (choosing to trust the unverifiable and relinquish the tile), but there are few points where she truly hesitates or attempts an opposing tactic, so the arc feels more like deepening surrender than tested conflict. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than concretely dramatized, keeping stakes potent but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—Vey’s hunger for an “after goodbye” versus his endless exile, and the mortals’ desire to escape immortal oversight—are clearly signaled and converge at the door. Escalation is present (storm peaks, anchors fail, shards unite, vision sharpens the choice), and the final act forecloses Vey’s prior state with felt cost. However, conflict with the technicians resolves almost too smoothly once the shard vision appears; there’s minimal on-page testing of their competing aims or hesitation about trusting an immortal. The tension could tighten further if their mutiny and Vey’s desire were forced into a sharper trade-off before cooperation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—securing posthumous asylum for her mother at the cost of Cassidy’s own memory—is clear from early on. Pressure tightens when Rurik dismisses the possibility, then reverses under the ink’s influence, turning abstract “granite policies” into a live, on-page test of that magic. Cassidy’s decision to spend her last meaningful honest memory is a credible, costly escalation that forecloses alternatives. The final beat, where the ink pot is rendered useless and Rurik is left with inward-pointing “shrapnel,” underlines lasting consequences rather than an easy win.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aurelia will continue to manipulate/shape history despite realizing its cost—emerges clearly once the labyrinth begins enacting her forgeries. Escalation is primarily internal: fear of “exhaust[ing] the world’s longing” versus her compulsion to understand and keep writing, then the decisive act of sacrificing a page. That choice yields visible cost (loss of one forgery, irreversible transformation of the bonsai and town’s silence) and feels earned by prior beats. Still, pressure never fully sharpens into a truly fraught dilemma; tension remains more meditative than gripping, which keeps the conflict band solid but not towering.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—will Mara remain erased, or can she carve a resistant form of existence inside a system that deletes people?—is signaled early and sharpened by the revelation that the city actively weaponizes poison to dissolve histories. Tension escalates meaningfully when the captain gives her the recorder, forcing a strategic choice between passive survival in the cracks and actively jamming the port’s reality-filters; her decision to weaponize memory against the drones is a clear tightening. Stakes stay mostly conceptual and social rather than viscerally dangerous on the page, but patrol drones and the archivist’s fate keep a sense of lurking cost. The resolution is earned through her choice to sacrifice the safety of anonymity-for-nothing in favor of namelessness-as-defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Arlen can truly “decode the universal riddle” or remain trapped in debunking—is clear and coherently pressured throughout. Escalation comes via each note raising emotional and conceptual stakes: mother, colleague, then his own dogma, culminating in the compass that forces a stance between proof and lived resonance. The visible cost is his acceptance of an answer that cannot be measured, sacrificing his public identity as a myth buster for a private, unprovable truth. Stakes are largely internal and philosophical rather than life-or-death, but they’re sharpened enough to sustain tension at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the carnival survives privatization—is clear and consistently pressed, and the key tightening is the decision to reorganize the city overnight rather than simply refuse. Internal and external conflicts interlock: Lina’s dual allegiance feeds into the compromise tactic of transformation instead of purity or surrender. The visible cost is somewhat soft—the main price is that the problem is only delayed, not solved—so the tension feels more like a clever evasive maneuver than a truly punishing trade-off. Still, escalation toward the inspectors’ visit and partial deflection of their power reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing a last, unrepeatable moment before irrevocable extinction—is clearly signaled and tightened by the explicit forty-three-minute window and the contract expiring at sunrise. Escalation is subtle but real: from setup to the first unfurling, to the terminator wind and the buried grain’s blush, to the forced choice to fire the shutter as the anemones close. Internal and external conflicts interweave well (her desire to keep witnessing vs the need to act decisively before the moment passes). The only small limit is that the moral calculus (no intervention possible) is largely foregone rather than tested on the page, keeping this just shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—repairing the drone in time to deliver medical seeds—is clearly signaled and escalates via deeper-than-expected damage and the discovery of the drone’s maladaptive feedback loop. The internal conflict about fear and feedback meaningfully intersects with the external task when Lira decides the real problem is terror, not hardware, and alters tactics accordingly. The deadline is real but slightly under-exploited; tension relies more on technical and emotional intricacy than tangible near-failure. Costs are mostly implicit (emotional strain, time risk) rather than dramatized in a concrete loss or painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the origin of rivers will be captured, erased, or allowed to remain a living secret—is clear and coherently threaded from the Registry’s summons to the final “Origin: classified” map. Pressure escalates through discoveries (the impossible warmth, the falcon’s death, the living map) and crystallizes at the point where Maren chooses to transmit an image instead of coordinates and then misfile the truth. The cost is mostly professional and ideological (defying her employer, accepting that her greatest find may be dismissed as myth) rather than immediate physical or relational, so the tension reads more cerebral than visceral. As a result, the conflict is strong and satisfying but not quite searing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can Elian restore the town’s shared balance, and at what cost—is established early and escalates well as the town half-rebuilds then stalls at the north ward. The key tightening is when revival proves partial and he must decide to feed his own heart’s rhythm into the ruins, culminating in the fork’s destruction and his own fading. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively, even if his choice comes with minimal on-page doubt. Stakes are large-scale yet grounded in concrete, consequential actions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—getting a distress call out before suffocation—is established early and clearly tethered to the shrinking air and muffling hush. Pressure escalates through coherent turns: signal suppression, physical entanglement of the mast, the dive to the organ, and the high-cost choice to expend the vial on a risky gambit. The external conflict (temple’s instinct to forget) and internal one (fear of wasting her last anchor to home) interlock at the climax. Resolution is earned by Mira’s agency rather than coincidence; the rescue sub’s arrival follows from her transformed signal rather than random chance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—who controls and defines the story/parable of the boy who cried wolf—is clear early and sharpened by the “before they find the bodies” clock and the father’s continued presence. Pressure escalates from atmospheric exploration to a concrete confrontation in the lantern room, then to a choice: remain in suspended “copperlight repose” or step onto the staircase of lies and descend into a self-defined role. Cassian’s final decision forecloses the option of lingering in his father’s unresolved narrative, accepting both inheritance and culpability (“the wolf is me”) as the cost. The external stakes around the keepers’ bones remain more conceptual than felt, slightly softening the sense of concrete peril.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how an unjustly inherited debt will be paid—is legible early and tightens meaningfully through the repeated visitations. The seventh-night confrontation, with the boy’s attempted blood-offering rejected and the guided choice to take the fruit, is a clear escalation driven by both characters’ stances. The cost is multifold (her dissolution, the orchard’s death, his permanent reconfiguration) and reads on the page, not just in summary. If anything, the boy’s agency could be marginally stronger before the final ritual, but his decisive reaching for the fruit still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a sacred connection between sea and stone, ruin and reverence—is clear and escalates through Calyx’s progressive commitments (surrendering to the dream earlier, sewing memories, then paying with blood and the plate). Pressure is situational rather than antagonistic, but the ritual’s demands (needing both memory and “optimism sharp enough to haunt the dead”) provide a meaningful tightening. The cost is present yet somewhat gentle; he succeeds without serious risk of failure or visible internal resistance. For a lyric piece, though, the escalation from passive recipient of the canyon’s stitching to active co-creator reads convincingly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether a colonially shattered faith and sacred space can be reconstituted—is clear early and tightens through concrete escalations: unearthed bones, humming relics, animated roots, and finally the risky dawn ritual. Conflict is primarily situational and spiritual rather than combative, but pressure still grows as her excavation reveals that many generations’ “interrupted journeys” hinge on her action. The main turn at dawn is earned by prior exploration and mapping rather than feeling like a sudden miracle. The visible price is her renunciation of further wandering and the implied obligation to steward this reawakened faith and its travelers.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily internal but legible: whether to surrender anonymity and risk being truly known, framed by the impending arrival of the mail drone. Pressure escalates via the live clock and the drone’s early appearance, forcing a concrete choice between two letters under limited time. The final decision closes off a real path—sending the confession—and the cost (continuing to live behind masks) is apparent. External stakes could be sharpened slightly, but for this length the internal conflict reads coherent and sufficiently tight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the coup succeeds or the republic survives—is signaled early and tightened by the hard time limit (“before the coup,” bell tolling three, sunrise). Escalation is clean: secret listening → completion of encoded map → high-risk public reveal → gun drawn → moral and tactical pivot as she narrates alternate futures. The primary resolution is driven by her agency, persuading the lieutenant and council to adopt new options. The one slight limitation is that the cost feels a bit bloodless on the page—she risks death, but the scene glides past bodily fear and consequences fairly quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will brave the “seam” to finally apologize—is clear from early on and tightens steadily. Moving from carrying unsent letters to actually entering the corridor and speaking at the frozen moment is an unmistakable escalation in cost and exposure. Agency is central: the narrator chooses to follow, to hold the shard, to step through, to kneel and speak, foreclosing long-held avoidance. While conflict is mostly internal, the piece maintains pressure and a genuine risk of psychic rupture or failure at the seam.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can transform paralyzing guilt into shared, survivable meaning—is clear and sharpened by the boy’s request to “unknot them before the dark eats the words.” Pressure escalates as the cipher on the cast turns personal (birthday, mistranslated village) and demands an on-the-spot re-narration to the child. The choice to stay, confess, and actively reframe each symbol is an Earned Stasis: nothing external is fixed, but a path of silence/self-protection is foreclosed. The conflict is mostly internal and could bear one more concrete external complication, but it still reads as a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Luma will risk re-exposing her grief to develop her lost joy—does escalate as she moves from searching color, to touching the charged fragment, to projecting and finally fixing the film onto the wall. The requirement of a “living wall” and the cost of each brushstroke create a real, if quiet, tightening. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric (fog, reluctance of beams) and internal resistance is understated, so threat and trade-off never feel sharply contested. The resolution is clearly achieved by her agency, but the sense of a foreclosed alternative path could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict—can Liora continue to work from certainty, or will she accept the nickel’s bargain and a never-finished picture—is clearly posed and escalates through the refusal of the stones, the nickel’s offer, and the nested awakenings. Pressure builds conceptually as each awakening strips away her old frame, culminating in her renunciation of completion as a goal. However, tension remains contemplative; there’s little sense of what she stands to lose beyond an abstract identity, and no strong counterforce tries to pull her back to safety. The resulting stakes are resonant but gently felt rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—protecting unauthorized thought from state taxation—are clear early and scale as Arlo risks planting the first seed under surveillance. Pressure tightens credibly with Voss’s arrival and the looming “nightly satellite pass,” forcing Arlo to activate the pollen system and warp escape rather than leisurely finish. The internal conflict is more principled than agonized; Arlo never seriously considers compliance, so tension is about execution under risk rather than moral trade-off. The cost is mostly potential (exposure, punishment) rather than an actual on-page loss, which keeps the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the transformation of accumulated anguish into something that can preempt future wars—is clear and steadily tightened as the lullaby shifts from off-key to “in key for the first time.” Internal and external pressures interweave: Zale’s exhaustion and inherited duty meet the call to finally act on the postcard’s instruction. His decision to “plant the card where darkness can root” forecloses the option of endless circling insomnia and enacts the thematic armistice. The escalation is more spiritual than confrontational, but for a lyric piece it still produces a meaningful and legible turn.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve the names/feelings or watch the marvels sink into “mute white nothing”—is stated plainly and then tightened via the chandelier’s demand of escalating payments. Each surrender of memory is a clear cost that narrows Lira’s remaining options, culminating in the non-trivial choice to give up even the memory of herself as the final bulb cries for her name. Internal and external conflicts braid well: her personal grief (Por, her mother) is not abstracted but becomes the currency. If there’s any small limitation, it’s that resistance is more implicit than dramatized—she pays the prices almost too smoothly—but the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can use extinct languages to restore communal trust—is clear and the pressure does escalate as the archive resists and time (the approaching Council) narrows her window. Her key turn is shifting from pure translation to restitution, offering her own promise and voice, which effectively deepens the conflict from technical to moral. However, resistance yields fairly quickly once she makes the offer, and the personal or material risk never fully bites on the page. The ending feels earned but not harrowing; the price is mostly symbolic (relinquishing the ink well) rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—upstream farmers versus downstream fishers over the river’s fate—is clear and stakes are concrete and mutually legitimate. Escalation comes through Mireya’s discovery and deployment of the lullaby, which reframes the dispute rather than intensifying confrontation, a choice that fits the story’s ethos. However, the delegations’ resistance dissolves quickly once the amphitheater harmonizes their demands; there’s little sense that the compromise is hard-won or that refusal is a live threat in the moment. A brief beat of pushback or visible hesitation would sharpen the sense of cost and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mirela’s ability to evade capture while remaking her identity and preserving lost songs—is clear and evolves from survival to legacy. Pressure tightens via the shift from private hiding to an open pigeon network and culminates when constables follow the paper trails to the shop, forcing her disappearance. The conflict is largely internal and situational rather than confrontational, which suits the piece but keeps on-page tension a bit gentle. The felt price of leaving Blackwood and the attic could be made fractionally sharper to heighten the sense of loss at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—can she interpret what her father tried to tell her about thresholds and find a way to live with his loss—emerges early and tightens as she decodes the table and recognizes “The Threshold” maze. The key escalation is her move from analysis in the kitchen to physically stepping off the terrace into the between-place, a credible act of agency under the story’s rules. The cost is conceptual and emotional (accepting necessary distance, entering a space where she both loses and finds him), though it remains relatively abstract and serene. There is no sharp reversal or external pressure, but for a lyric piece the deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central pressure arises from an internal conflict—empirical charting versus ceremonial belonging—set against the situational risk of being stranded, and it does tighten as she commits more fully to the ritual. The most meaningful turn is when she chooses ritual over data and then physically enacts the rite via the moon-pipe and shared exhale. However, external stakes (being left behind, physical danger) remain mostly conceptual; the clock and environment do not force difficult tradeoffs in scene as sharply as they could. Tension is present and cumulative but relatively gentle for the scale of potential peril.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how a vanished path can be recovered or reimagined—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates modestly: initial listening and conjecture deepen into contact with abandonment, then into a creative gamble (mosaic + conjecture) that succeeds at transforming, not restoring, the path. The conflict is mostly conceptual and emotional, with no substantial resistance or risk of failure dramatized beyond uncertainty, so tension never quite tightens to a sharp edge. Effective and coherent, but not yet operating at the highest level of felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Cipher can meaningfully disrupt monotony via orchestrated accident—is clear and escalates from solitary set-up to a public cascade of consequences. His deliberate timing and placement create one strong tightening as minor inconveniences blossom into communal, improvisational upheaval. The cost and risk remain largely conceptual and reputational rather than personally dangerous, which keeps tension at a refined, cerebral level instead of something more viscerally fraught. Still, his final act of letting go of control in the slot-machine pull crystallizes the conflict between order and randomness with satisfying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming and embodying banned memory at personal risk—is clear and sharpened by the nostalgia ban and her prior refusal to serve as state propagandist. Escalation comes through the time pressure of approaching dawn and the dwindling moonstone dust, culminating in the “final verse demanded sacrifice” beat. The price is conceptual and existential rather than physical, but her transformation into a living contraband archive with no way back to anonymity is legible. The conflict remains largely internal; an on-page brush with external enforcement would have increased pressure but is not strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—settling “noctilucent reckonings” by sunrise—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the prism flares and the mundane objects become “luminous relics,” forcing her to recognize and name them. The major choice is the decision to hurl the prism and effectively surrender a powerful, personal tool to heal the town. However, resistance is minimal; the outcome feels foregone once the assignment is understood, so tension operates more as solemn fulfillment than genuine uncertainty. For the most demanding markets, one sharper beat of doubt or competing obligation would add needed bite to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias continues to contain his guilt or risks exposing it in order to help others—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through the progressively irreversible acts: opening the box, putting ash on his tongue, speaking aloud after long silence, crying, and finally deciding to go to the survivors’ group. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, though all turns are inward and contemplative, so the tension remains more lyrical than sharply agonistic. The cost of breaking the long-kept “bargain” is felt but could be rendered with one more moment of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing a fraying consensus reality by engineering hope—is articulated early and revisited, and there is one clear tightening when the balloon arrives and demands a variable “waiting for her to write the next.” Her decision to bleed onto the silk and speak the equation is the main act of agency, and it does trigger a meaningful change. However, the conflict feels largely unopposed; no serious risk of failure or alternative path is dramatized on the page, so escalation reads more like a smooth unfolding than genuine testing of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what it means to inherit and interpret the building’s memories—intensifies as Mira’s work shifts from professional mapping to personal entrapment. Escalation is clear: from listening at a wall to entering forbidden spaces to being literally reconfigured into an echo. However, pressure remains largely conceptual; we don’t see many alternative tactics or a moment where she might turn back, so her “choice” to continue feels somewhat foregone. The cost is undeniable but could be sharpened by one explicit resisted or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether she’ll sacrifice the heartbeat to shift mirrors from judgment to possibility—is legible early and tightens as she moves from cooperative mirrors to the third, demanding one. The key escalation is the ultimatum from the cracked hand-mirror, forcing a real trade-off: lose the heartbeat (and maybe be deceived) or remain limited and alone in her work. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but the mirror’s resistance resolves relatively quickly once she sings louder, softening the sense of prolonged strain. Still, the decision clearly forecloses a powerful option and reweights her future.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can reframe an endless war into a shared, bearable peace—emerges early and tightens as he shifts from intending to burn the names to publicly speaking them and inviting others to witness. The arrival and ascent of the Skyborne and Deepkin provide a satisfying deepening of pressure, turning a solitary ritual into a communal choice with real emotional risk. However, external opposition is essentially absent; no one resists or complicates the ritual, keeping conflict primarily internal and ceremonial. The cost is felt, but the path is relatively unimpeded, which softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can summon and preserve an echo of what he destroyed—appears early and tightens as the storm builds and the map instructs him to wait for the exact lull. His choice to swallow the sound rather than release or annihilate it is a meaningful, costly narrowing of options that fuses internal guilt with external ritual. Tension is more textural than suspenseful, but the cadence of thunder pauses, sparks across the egg, and the imminent rain delivers a clear escalation. The only ceiling is that external jeopardy remains abstract (no risk to life or others on the page), keeping the conflict primarily moral and existential.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are significant and clearly articulated early—if she fails, the city will fall into “eternal obedience by dawn”—and the ritual to unlock the core constitutes the main pressure point. However, the conflict is largely procedural and symbolic, with no active resistance, misfire, or meaningful setback once she begins; success feels more foreordained than hard-won. Internal conflict is implied (her pulse as “betrayal,” the terror of freedom), but it doesn’t generate concrete alternative choices in the ritual itself. The consequence lands, but escalation is muted rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—whether Lucien’s art must serve revolution or retain its own ethical ambiguity—is well signaled via the gallery quarrel and sharpened in the ritual. Pressure escalates as he literally burns the story stick, reverses his story, and confronts uncomfortable memories of compromise and refusal. However, the stakes stay largely ethical-philosophical; there’s little sense that he could choose an easier path and pay a painful relational or material price, so the cost feels mostly conceptual. The final choice to “letter…with questions rather than answers” is strong but not agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can give fragile, threatened histories a ritual form before they vanish—is clear, and pressure deepens when the twin butterfly appears to claim its lost wing, reweighting her task from abstract to personally witnessed. Escalation is primarily textural rather than oppositional: the increasing number of butterflies and the impending dissolution of the grotto subtly tighten the window. Her primary “risk” is letting the memorial and wing go, which she accepts with little hesitation, so we lack a sharp moral or practical dilemma. Tension is present but quiet; the piece leans on atmosphere over hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the nameless dead before the glacier erases them and transforming the narrator’s relationship to sound—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates as he moves from intention to irreversible action: entering post-forgiveness, threading the fragile card, closing the braid-circuit, and triggering the auroral flare/voicing, each step committing him further. The cost is internal and conceptual rather than combative, but the story makes that felt: he trades the solidity of bronze for the more precarious task of carrying a living vibration. A slightly sharper articulation of what might be lost if he fails in the middle third could raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is her relation to continuity vs. decay, focused through the approaching storm and the directive; escalation tracks from preparation, to dream-vision of devouring paths, to literal merger with the storm. Agency is present—she chooses to lie on the lens, to place the seal, to step into the cataract, to “offer the storm her memories”—and these choices drive the decisive change. Still, conflict seldom feels resistant; there’s little friction or genuine risk she might refuse or fail, which softens the sense of real sacrifice. The result is a strong but mostly smooth escalation, more visionary than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving a relationship to the cosmos independent of regimes—is clear and present from early on. Pressure rises through the temporal constraint of the incoming king and the progressive unveiling of the tile’s power. However, opposition is almost entirely atmospheric; nothing actively resists him once he enters the sanctum, so the conflict remains more contemplative than harrowing. The cost of self-erasure lands, but the path there feels smooth rather than rigorously tested.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—liberating war-ghosts from resentment without violence—is clear from the outset and tightens when the sanctuary manifests Lira’s own unresolved anger as an active opponent. The escalation from soothing others to being forced to undergo the same process herself is strong, and her decision to accept the burn of “every bomb” metabolizing through her body reads as a genuine price. The cost is more spiritual/psychic than situational, but appropriately scaled to the story’s mode and length. Stakes remain a bit abstract at times (“calculus of vengeance solved itself into zero”), though the concrete dog and strawberry memories partly anchor them.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the runaway dream to restore her craft and self—is clear from the outset and escalates through the corridor opening and the choice to bleed onto the sextant. The key tightening beat is the self-wounding to repair the instrument and tether the dream, which narrows options and shows agency. Internal and external stakes are braided effectively: failure would leave both orchard and self in a kind of permanent ruin. What holds this below the top band is the relative ease and inevitability of the final reintegration; there’s little sense of potential failure or enduring loss beyond a symbolic three drops of blood.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the mender will repair the orchard after institutional betrayal—is clear and tightened when she must act without the council, using her mother’s risky teachings and personal relics. The key escalation is her refusal of the elders’ amended contracts, which forecloses an easy reconciliation and locks in a path of costly independence. Internal and external conflicts (resentment vs care, contract vs apology) are braided, but the resistance she faces is largely conceptual; there’s little concrete pushback or risk to her body or child once the ritual succeeds. As a result, tension is strong but not quite knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—pursue forbidden knowledge vs preserve her past/sanity—is signaled by the stomach-envelope command and tighten as plucked fruits erase kindness-pages. Escalation is clear: inquiry fails, fruit-harvesting exacts an immediate price, and the bathroom’s supposed safety is inverted into a chrysalis that forces a more radical choice at the drain. Mara’s decision to ask “What inherits the inheritor?” and step through the “Index” door is an earned resolution that trades personal continuity for systemic understanding. The conflict is primarily conceptual and internal, which works, but a slightly more visceral register around the erasures would heighten the sense of unavoidable harm.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—rescuing the time traveler and stealing back unlearned lessons—are clear and scale appropriately for the premise. There are meaningful turns (the choice to sacrifice a year, the cipher requiring an unspeakable word, the decision to release absences instead of hoarding knowledge), and these arise from Elara’s agency. However, obstacles are dispatched almost as soon as they appear; the paragraph-prison, cipher, and traversal of the collapsing footnotes resolve without sustained resistance, limiting felt jeopardy. The ethical and conceptual stakes are stronger than the moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering and integrating a true name/identity—is signaled early and escalates as she moves from eerie exploration to confronting contradictory origin stories in the mirrors. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the emerald card and the coat of narrative threads demand an irreversible naming, with the cost of sinking the entire carnival-world. The conflict is largely internal but consistently externalized through setting and ritual, so the climax reads as a genuine test of willingness to stop “trying to be separate.” It could push higher with one sharper on-page moment of doubt or refusal undercutting her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether a catastrophically forgotten piece of history will remain erased or be safely re-housed—is clear and narrows as Elara discovers the treaty story and commits to embodying the village in the rope. Pressure escalates via the ritual itself: the gears shiver, letters surface and sink, and her braiding literally reconfigures the world’s relationship to that absence. However, there’s minimal resistance or trade-off: once she understands her task, success feels largely assured, and we don’t see a concrete alternative path or price that she seriously weighs. The tension is more contemplative than fraught, which is effective but keeps the stakes from fully sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stakes—survive the energy beings and carry the last map out so memory persists—are clear early and remain coherent. Pressure escalates via the ticking “bloom of hush,” the humming southern gallery, and approaching the beings’ feeding ground, with one key tactical turn: using the predicted hush to re-etch the dome and sever sound paths. The protagonists’ agency drives resolution (choosing to advance, to show the Warden the hush-image, to carve the mute canyons), but the antagonistic force barely adapts, simply dimming and folding inward when deprived of sound. As a result, the climax reads as an elegant but relatively uncontested execution of a plan rather than a hard-fought, high-cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether a small, seemingly meaningless act of rekindling can assert pattern and hope against a collapsed world—is clear and present early. Internal and external conflict interweave, with the shard quest and the burden of retrocognition both pressing her toward a choice. However, the middle pressure (her journey to find the child’s skeleton) is relatively unresisted; she succeeds on the seventh night without significant obstacle or reversal, which softens escalation. The final choice to stand as the new prism and bear ongoing responsibility does carry a clear, if largely conceptual, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—what version of self will be preserved within a city that archives memory—is legible early and sharpened as the fog begins to harden and she measures the “moment memory would ossify.” Tension escalates through concrete tests: the pellet impact forcing her into a stranger’s joy, the temptation of the fog-catch as a definitive act, and the Archive’s demand for “purity” versus her visceral resistance. The decisive turn—embracing fragmentation and sculpting the figure instead of jumping or submitting—is clearly driven by her agency and closes off real alternatives. Stakes stay internal and metaphysical, but they feel consequential and not merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core conflict—hope and playful defiance versus institutionalized despair—is clear and escalates as Luma moves from perimeter (Jax, the moat) to inner power (the governor on the battlement). There’s one main tightening at the confrontation with the governor where she stakes her craft and identity on a single demonstration. However, opposition softens quickly: the sentry is neutralized with a single dust-breath and the governor consents and then effectively yields without pushing her to a near-failure moment, so the outcome feels somewhat assured. Internal conflict in Luma (fear, doubt, temptation to yield) is underplayed, keeping tension more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether and how mother and daughter can move through their rupture—is clear from the second sentence and narrows across the scene. Pressure escalates not via reversals but via deepening: her solitary ritual, the daughter’s hesitant arrival, the silent co-watching, the cicada handover, then the explicit metaphor that invites the daughter into her “native tongue.” The real cost is choosing vulnerability over avoidance by restarting the difficult conversation, scaled well for this quiet piece. A minor limitation is that external stakes remain very contained, but for this length and lens the internal conflict feels adequately tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will internalize the bunker’s logic of containment or reconfigure her relationship to silence and space—is signaled early and sharpened progressively. Escalation is accumulative but clear: tentative first silence, sweeter second, transactional third, then the absolute membrane and final silence that would “carry the bunker inside her forever.” Her climactic act is an earned renunciation: instead of hoarding the ultimate quiet, she sacrifices her collection and the doll, accepting an “ordinary hush” with a real emotional cost. Pressure remains internal and metaphysical rather than mortal, but it’s consistent and culminates decisively for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the commuter can voice his deepest fear within Nilo’s curated hush—emerges early through the decibel rule and storm glass ritual. Pressure escalates via the dial spiking to thirty, the wind carrying in ghost-echoes, and the storm glass shifting toward clarity, all converging on the forced confession. The cost is emotional exposure and the risk of breaking the hush; the low decibel of the spoken fear (26) neatly embodies his managed vulnerability. The conflict remains internal and quietly handled, so it never feels harrowing, but for a lyric piece the tightening is well executed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reach the stairway before sunrise and potentially claim the throne—is clearly signaled and followed through, but escalation is modest. Once she’s in the palace, each step (torch, door, stair, crown) presents little resistance, and no option is truly foreclosed or tested. The time pressure and shifting waterfall pattern function more as decorative tension than as forces that change her decisions. The final “cost” is mostly conceptual (accepting responsibility) rather than dramatized as a painful or risky trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the boy’s fragment can cross, and what that costs the keeper—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates credibly from his suffocating presence to the intimacy of shared scars and pain, culminating in his dissolution and her altered understanding of breathing. The conflict remains mostly interior/ritual rather than confrontational, so the sense of narrowed options is more emotional than tactical but it still reads. Her ongoing self-suffocation as a chosen endurance adds a quiet but real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking out of predatory debt (personal and multiversal)—is signaled early via “unpaid invoices” and the hypnotic 42 Hz hum. Pressure tightens through the escalating text messages, the heightened root-cave environment, and the compressive act of twisting the bolt while the choir of parallel selves urges her on. Her choice to spend forgiveness and over-tighten the bolt, then to discard the diamond rather than cash it in, clearly forecloses paths with cost. The main trade-off is that external jeopardy (what if she fails or is harmed) is underplayed, so conflict remains primarily conceptual and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—whether to awaken and then reveal the dynasty’s buried confession—tightens steadily from intention, to eerie search, to listening, to public declaration. Stakes escalate from personal knowledge to city-wide consequence once Arin speaks the confession aloud and citizens and statues respond. The cost is legible: Arin’s blood, the snapped handle, and the implied loss/remaking of identity. The Muse’s question about losing one’s name gestures at a deeper moral dilemma, but Arin’s answer feels almost predetermined, leaving limited sense of competing live options.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing the jester-king’s soul at the price of the knight’s own fate—is established early and tightened effectively at the puppet’s ultimatum. The central turn (from seeking to capture possibility to accepting becoming its prisoner/guardian) is driven by his choice and carries undeniable cost. Internal and external conflicts are well braided, though the acceptance is almost too swift for the magnitude of the sacrifice. Still, the enduring consequence of his new role gives the conflict real weight beyond the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Rowan will remain a passive warden of loss or risk acting on behalf of an unknown child—is clear and quietly escalated by the personal resonance of the button and the blank line in Marcus’s file. Pressure intensifies not through external antagonism but through her deepening recognition of parallels between these “unknown histories” and her own. Her choice to annotate the file and insert the button is an earned, if modest, act of agency that narrows her stance going forward. The conflict remains interior and contemplative, so the sense of concrete risk is gentle rather than bracing, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether repressed histories can be reclaimed despite a surveillance regime—is clear and tested: drones reappear, the plan “unravels,” and Mira chooses to execute a riskier, more consequential hack. Escalation is coherent: waiting and mapping → sprint and infiltration → technical calibration → citywide broadcast under direct threat. Her final act (turning the key and stepping out as officers arrive) narrows her options to sacrifice or capture, giving the conflict a tangible edge. The only limitation is that opposition never adapts beyond showing up; the pressure is intense but somewhat one-directional.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from fully speaking, especially its declaration of his death date—is clear and consistently pressured by the rising sun and increasingly insistent hush. Escalation is well handled: from routine dawn playing to the atrium’s activation, to spectral voices naming concrete futures, to the final desperate, self-erasing note. His agency is central; his musical tactics (diminished chords, trills, negative space) are the means of resistance. The cost is more spiritual/existential than materially dramatized, which fits the piece but slightly softens the felt risk moment to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the arbor can regain equilibrium and how the world chooses what to remember—is clear, and it tightens as singular observation becomes communal practice. The primary turn (prodding the leaf and seeing the map) and the later choice to release the moonstone provide escalation, but the pressure remains gentle and mostly abstract; there is no strong sense of jeopardy or potential failure. Consequences are almost entirely positive, with minimal felt trade-off when memories and monuments lift away. The conflict therefore functions more as an elegant puzzle and ritual than as a truly tested dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—will Elias cling to “fixing” time or enter into improvisational uncertainty—is signaled early and tightened through the cellar sequence, especially the moment he chooses to plunge after the compass and later to leave both artifacts in the pool. Pressure rises coherently from odd greenhouse gusts to the uncanny waterfall to a life structured by that choice, and the Earned Stasis of his final refusal to descend again carries a believable cost (relinquishing direct access to the mystery). However, external opposition is minimal; the world rarely pushes back beyond eerie invitation, so the escalation feels more like deepening than real narrowing of options, which keeps stakes elegant but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aurelia can transform grief and guilt into a workable form of redemption—is established early and tightened through the successive “limits” she tests. Each experiment raises the emotional cost (naming Caelum, weighing the name, calcining regret) and narrows her options toward accepting that redemption is an ongoing calibration rather than a single fix. The decisive shift is her choice to embed the mended coin in herself and then step out to join the search with a new purpose, which clearly forecloses the prior stance of paralyzed atonement. Pressure remains mostly internal and textural rather than sharply reversible, which slightly softens the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara can catch and heal the child’s giggle before it’s distorted or lost—is clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates modestly: the giggle flees, the harp’s warped music threatens to twist it, and Elara adapts by physically engaging the environment (climbing, using the tooth on the string). There is no strong antagonistic force beyond entropy and misalignment, so the conflict remains more atmospheric than oppositional. The resolution is earned by her choices, but the felt price and narrowing of options could be intensified for greater dramatic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—can suffering be converted into mercy by quantifying it—is clear early and escalates via increasingly costly self-experiments: deeper into the forest, more intense proprioceptive spikes, bracing against burning bark and one’s own ribs. The strap removal is a meaningful tightening choice, foreclosing the path of endless masked penance and risking being “uncontained” before the forest. Stakes are internal but concrete: the body as site of punishment vs the possibility of partial absolution. The only limitation is that no external antagonist or new threat complicates tactics; escalation is primarily intensity rather than new constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The core stake—whether the narrator will continue to possess and use the fragment (and the role it anchors) or return it and accept the loss—is signaled early and tightened by the painting revealing their own past act. Stepping through into the painting is the central escalation, forcing a confrontation between want (the shard as identity, comfort, power) and need (to honor overlooked histories by “returning what was taken”). The choice to give the fragment back is clearly a sacrifice, followed by renouncing the translator role and leaving with “pockets empty,” which prevents a soft reset. Conflict is primarily internal but remains tense and specific, with no sense of hand-waved resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will keep “fixing” and ascending despite seeing inevitable falls—is clear and deepens as she confronts the time loop and the ghosts’ expectations. Escalation is internal but real: the shimmer-ladder climb and the crack-in-time revelation meaningfully raise the cost of her choice. Her final act of leaving the mainspring and walking out is a true renunciation of a tempting, literal fix. The stakes are more existential than situational, so they never quite knife into visceral urgency, though they’re well-scaled for this form.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Corwin will trigger a rupture by compressing eternity, risking the library’s “perfect system”—is signaled via the keeper’s warning and realized when he prints the sentence. Escalation is clear but primarily conceptual: the physical destabilization (cracking fruit, melting pears, warping orrery) raises the cost, and his final step onto the cloud represents a committed stance. However, there is little resistance or serious temptation to preserve the status quo; he never truly considers *not* pulling this lever, which softens tension. The conflict works for a lyric piece but could sharpen with a more dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Aurelia can wrest one last meaningful, imaginative victory from her failed revolution under the pressure of a lethal time-storm and institutional opposition—is clear early and tightens convincingly. Escalation is well handled: discovery of the shard’s power; the approaching storm; the labor of covering mirrors; and the standoff with the archaeologist culminating in her deliberate destruction of the shard. The external conflict with the archaeologist dovetails with the internal conflict around legacy and ownership of history, forcing a peak choice that forecloses a path (keeping the artifact intact, or walking away). Costs are not only personal (her dissolution) but conceptual (revolution relocated to a non-human substrate), which reads as earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes (reopening the sky / restoring his daughter’s colors) are clear and emotionally grounded, and the covenant’s demand for honesty provides a real ethical pressure point. The key tightening is when he must state that he did not come “to save the city first,” forcing want vs. guilt into direct conflict. After that, conflict resolves without further complication—no real risk of failure or visible negative consequence beyond his confession. The result is resonant but somewhat low-friction for the scale of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Ivy will submit to the lagoon’s logic and pay a personal price to reach “where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightened as she descends and initiates readings. Escalation reads as a steady deepening rather than sharp reversals: from factory ghosting → stair aura → lagoon memories → the revealed requirement that *her* hand must release the compass. The tribute sequence, where she uncorks all vials, is a meaningful irreversible choice that forecloses remaining safely observational. Because stakes are metaphysical rather than life-or-death, their cost is slightly cooler on the page even though it’s conceptually robust.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Maela will relate to the slide’s power and to navigation itself—is legible, and there is one solid tightening when the projected fleet gains weight and begins “pushing” the arch, compelling her to carve. Internal and external pressures (storm, ledger of debts, obligation to the timewoven fleet) interweave effectively. That said, the conflict remains relatively soft: Maela is rarely tempted toward an opposing choice, and physical danger from the storm never truly bites, so the price of her final stance feels more conceptual than sharply dramatized. Strong, but not yet bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Liora’s need to understand night-blooming flowers/dawning hush—clarifies early and tightens as winter deepens and she persists in an increasingly ascetic vigil. Escalation is subtle but present: early curiosity becomes a full winter-long commitment, then a physical risk (sleeping in frost), then a transformative act of painting on the glass and finally renouncing the pavilion. The cost is more spiritual than practical—she relinquishes the site and lives inside the question rather than “solving” it—but that cost is felt. The one constraint is that pressure remains almost entirely internal and never quite forces a hard trade-off between competing goods on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are both intimate (mother’s betrayal, forfeited futures) and political (exposing the Repression amid a peace accord), and they tighten coherently. The negotiation with the lagoon escalates cost by trading increasingly personal future details, culminating in the revelation of maternal betrayal as the sharpest internal pressure point. The climactic choice to read aloud over the capital is clearly a point of no return, with explicit risk of punishment and loss of a safer path. A small limitation is that external antagonistic pressure (Council, state) remains off-stage, so danger is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to enshrine memory in static comfort (bottle) or keep it kinetic and costly—is clear and sharpened by the bottle’s increasing “hunger.” The key tightening comes when the bottle demands the scrolls, forcing a renunciation that defines the path forward through the burning-ritual choice. Conflict is mostly internal and philosophical, but it does manifest in concrete micro-actions (burying the bottle, designing a recurring act that will hurt each time). Escalation could be slightly more acute (e.g., more tangible temptation or risk) to heighten the felt price of the refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Ambrose engages with the accidental prophecy—tightens effectively as the Hittite phrase destabilizes, then personally implicates him through the childhood memory. The immersion attempt is a clear pressure point that generates a new complication (the time-crossed recording of his own voice) rather than resolving tension, and his final stance to accept the foghorn’s migration into himself forecloses the option of simple erasure. Stakes are conceptually high (bearing the city’s broken promises) but remain mostly atmospheric; there’s no antagonistic force or concrete consequence test beyond his interior resolve. This keeps conflict from reaching a sharper, more dramatic inflection that top venues might want.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (whether and how time will resume, and what happens to the seeds) is clear and sharpened by the vortex awakening and the seeds being pulled toward erasure or transformation. Escalation is present but gentle: the tension increases as seeds levitate, orbit, and the vortex offers its choice, culminating in her unorthodox decision to split the bead. The cost—taking on part of the spiral herself and altering how seasons turn—is conceptually potent but not viscerally painful, keeping the conflict slightly lofty. There are no major reversals beyond that final choice, so the pressure feels steady rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to uphold civic protocol or honor a deeper, riskier “listening” to the mountain—is clear and sharpened by the ticking zero hour. Escalation is subtle but real: barometer dips, wind shifts, and the tactile “tug” on the rope build to her decision to reroute the test and then manually trigger the bell. Agency drives the climax: she presses the switch knowing she’s subverting a century of practice. The cost is primarily conceptual/reputational rather than viscerally dramatized, which slightly softens the felt risk but fits the story’s quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are primarily internal—can he reconcile fragility and strength—and they escalate through concrete turns: the lingering reflections, the lantern brightening, the pulsing fleck, the cosmic vision, then the question about burning vs. changing. His choice to touch the ember and later to abandon the lantern and job are meaningful acts that foreclose paths and carry cost. Pressure is more contemplative than oppositional, but within an accumulative lens it tightens convincingly toward the meteor’s ethical question. A slightly clearer sense of what he risks in leaving the observatory physically would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Alden will continue bearing the ghosts’ unspoken words or release them—is legible early and tightens with the new child ghost and the hairline fracture. Conflict is primarily internal and situational, but the dream of catastrophic release raises stakes effectively, making the choice to stay and “hold” more than a passive default. The escalation is a single, well-executed deepening rather than a series of reversals, which suits the lyric mode but keeps pressure in the “strong” rather than “exceptional” band. Cost is emotional and existential rather than plot-perilous, yet it reads clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering what time “feels like” after numbers fail—is clear and threads the whole piece, but pressure remains gentle rather than urgent. There is a meaningful tightening when he experiences noon as a new texture and immediately inscribes that on tags, then escalates by trading away the urn fragment, his last artifact of quantified time. That trade carries conceptual and emotional cost, marking an irreversible move toward the new economy of stories. Still, conflict never quite bites; there’s little real resistance or risk of failure beyond a quiet existential discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—how to live and make art with broken, incomplete materials—is clear and present, and it does deepen as he shifts from solitary tending to shared improvisation with the woman. The encounter with her, the tuning of the broken string, and the choice to erase his own line are the main tightening beats. However, the pressure remains low-vibration; there is little sense of a live alternative path being foreclosed beyond a more perfectionist, less-relational stance. The conflict is resonant but not particularly sharp or risky on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The core stake—Mara must reconfigure the orchard into a self-sustaining treaty before her deadline—shows on the page and tightens as she moves from single wounded oak to full-circuit organism. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial: bats responding to the new frequency, fox family gathering, her hands shaking in month five, all deepen the sense that she’s racing biological limits to complete a delicate, high-stakes system. The decisive turn is the final strand and the wrapping of the last diary page, which forecloses her staying as mediator and commits her to being encoded instead. Because external opposition is minimal (no one seriously resists her), tension is more conceptual/ethical than visceral, which limits peak intensity but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—testing whether “homecoming” is chemical rather than mythic—is clear and escalates when the spores forcibly overwrite her controlled stance. The tower’s awakening and gentle collapse intensify the pressure by erasing the old infrastructure of belonging and closing off the option of repeating the experiment. Her final choice to re-fossilize the amber and walk away in a new stance is earned, but the price she pays feels largely conceptual, with limited on-page emotional or practical fallout. The tension operates more in idea than in felt jeopardy, which slightly blunts the escalation’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the battlefield’s wound can be transformed and the treaty restored—is clear and steadily pursued. Pressure escalates texturally as we move from seed choice to voice-breaking incantation to visible transformation, with his bodily cost registering. However, conflict is largely one-sided; nothing pushes back against his attempt, and no real alternative path or failure mode is dramatized. This makes the resolution feel beautiful and moving but somewhat foregone, with less sharpness in the ethical or practical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—collapsing the distance to Kite’s missing brother—is clearly established and pursued, and the riddle/decode moment functions as a genuine tightening that changes their options. There is escalation in moving from abstract longing to concrete coordinates to digging him out. However, overt obstacles or trade-offs are minimal; no choice feels truly dangerous or mutually exclusive, and success unfolds with few setbacks once the mechanism is understood. The emotional cost of war and separation is felt, but on-page jeopardy or sacrifice during the quest remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Kael will live with or reconfigure his grief—is clear early and escalates from quiet remembrance to a choice about crossing into an altered state with his mother. The key tightening is the discovery of the hatch and living light, which redefines his options from endurance of loss to a radical reconfiguration of existence. His final act of taking her hand forecloses a return to his prior life, but the internal contest over that cost is underplayed; he doesn’t resist or hesitate much once the vision appears. Tension is more atmospheric than agonistic, but it’s coherent and does deepen toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether truth and rule will yield to wonder and amendment—is clear, with the chess match as the pressure crucible. Escalation builds through the climb’s physical risk, the memory-laden moves, the queen sacrifice, and the secret-bishop substitution, culminating in Halcyon’s step onto the shadow stair. The cost is legible: he abandons his dominion and self-constructed mind-game; she gives up the sundial and her singular role. Tension is more mythic and lyrical than edge-of-seat, but it does tighten meaningfully toward the decision beats.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether tenderness and minor lives will be erased or preserved under the next regime—is clear and becomes embodied when an armed patrol intrudes on Mara’s secret practice. Pressure tightens meaningfully when Kestrel enters tracing her path, introduces the possibility of execution, then instead offers a question that tests her chosen vocation. The rifle, missing pawns, and dawn deadline create a credible, if understated, sense of cost and narrowing options. Escalation is more symbolic than visceral; one more concrete consequence or visible fear response could heighten the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she reclaims memory at the price of re-imprisoning her talents and enlarging the bookstore-cage—is sharply defined and escalates well. The custodian’s offer is an excellent central tightening, forcing a moral and existential trade-off rather than a simple fetch-quest resolution. Her decision to shatter her own reflection instead of re-seeding drives the destructive climax and has visible cost: loss of supernatural agency, annihilation of the refuge she created, and permanent burial of her talents. A small limitation is that external jeopardy to her body is less foregrounded than metaphysical stakes, slightly softening visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Marek will remain trapped in self-punishing stasis or move toward self-forgiveness—is clear early and tightens as he shifts from abstract contemplation to concrete engagement (decoding, then walking, then correcting the fallen king). Pressure is primarily internal but escalates via pattern-deepening: recognizing the stitch-code as portrait, realizing the maze is a mirror, and finally accepting a “checkmated yet smiling” model of loss. The cost of action—relinquishing paralysis, risking re-entry into a world where the duke’s daughter may or may not live—is felt if quiet. It falls just shy of the very top band because the danger remains conceptual rather than being tested by a direct external counterforce on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how and whether Lira can redistribute the truth/blame of the queen’s plea before the ritual claims it—is legible and time-bounded by the “one hour” frame. Pressure escalates through her active experiments (refraction, poetry) into the key turn where she abandons performance and chooses to listen, culminating in the high-cost declaration “I accept the cost.” That choice reconfigures her options: she forgoes the official ritual and embraces a more dangerous, self-authored path (painting with her own blood). What holds this below the highest tier is that the external antagonistic force (priests/ritual) remains abstract and never directly tests her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict between personal survival and restoring memory/meaning is established early and escalates through the chain countdown and the realization that healing the statue endangers the workshop. Her decision to proceed anyway is clearly a trade-off, and the workshop’s sinking is an unmistakable price. Internal and external stakes are well-braided: the more successful the magic, the heavier the cost. The escalation is primarily linear rather than featuring multiple reversals, but it’s sufficiently tight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how and whether the quay can be preserved as it’s erased—appears immediately with the broken mirror and escalates coherently through the cave and shell discoveries. Pressure deepens rather than multiplies: the mirror’s failure, the imminent demolition, and the shell’s impossible imagery all narrow Ren’s options until hiding the shell becomes the only credible way to honor both loss and memory. The cost is felt: he forfeits the possibility of public, recognized preservation in favor of a secret, perhaps never-seen eternity. The one arguable limitation is that external opposition remains atmospheric rather than personified, but for this quiet internal conflict, the escalation still reads strong and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that soft, intentional vibrations can reach farther than harsh signals—is clear, but pressure mostly accumulates texturally rather than through escalating obstacles. The heat wave’s end is a structural constraint, yet once it breaks she encounters no real resistance; the ritual proceeds as planned, and the boat’s response is a gentle confirmation rather than a contested outcome. Internal conflict (fear she might be wrong, fear of further loss) remains largely implicit instead of dramatized in on-page dilemmas. As a result, tension feels steady and low rather than tightening toward a truly costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—reversing the geography of loss vs. the personal cost of doing so—is established early and sharpened as each call demands more of her body and identity. Escalation is clear: from mechanical repair to bodily sacrifice to ontological transformation, culminating in the realization she is “not the navigator but the offering.” Her decision to step into the spiral forecloses a path (remaining a separate self) with a visible cost. The conflict stays primarily internal and conceptual, but it remains tense and coherent under the lyric, accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to numb or bear the communal emotional noise—is clear early and intensifies through the preparation of a risky cure. Pressure escalates via the eye’s intervention, the accidental spill, and the sentient film that forces the consent-to-be-witnessed dilemma; these turns narrow her options and demand a true stance. The decision to drink the altered mixture, not as anaesthetic but as a gentling burden, is an earned resolution that forecloses the fantasy of complete quiet. The primarily internal nature of the conflict is nonetheless kept tense through concrete, bodily threats and time-constrained action in the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Maris will accept or break the debt of borrowed memories—is signaled early and tightened through accumulating anomalies and the recursive apparition. Pressure escalates effectively when the stranger reappears between lamp pulses, transforming curiosity into an urgent need to alter the cycle. Her chosen tactic (sacrificing her own memories by casting away the flower) clearly forecloses a path and pays a visible price on-page. The conflict remains mostly internal and situational rather than combative, but for this lyric mode it maintains coherent tension to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept a radically different life—is legible and tied to his father’s promise. There is a meaningful tightening at the doorway, where his comfort with the familiar shop confronts the possibility the portal offers. However, almost every external development (the chip’s activation, the ants, the hidden passage) smooths his path rather than testing his resolve. Internal and external pressures never truly bite against each other, so the choice, while coherent, doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will be remembered and whether the kingdom’s sky will hold—emerges early and tightens as the starlight is revealed to be people’s memories of her. Pressure escalates from eerie warnings to literal erasure to a final, sharply drawn fork: descend and doom the world to the catastrophe she foresaw, or stay and surrender her living memory to maintain the sky. Her agency is central; the climax is her stepping onto the dais and accepting the crown, not a convenient external rescue. The only minor limitation is that external opposition is more situational than enacted, making this primarily an internal-moral confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—what Corin will do with his technology and with his presence in relation to Mira—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from private realization (“selling absence”) to the risk of confession, then to an irreversible act (destroying a valuable pocket-sun and redefining his craft) that forecloses a lucrative, safe path. Internal and relational conflicts interweave well, especially in Mira’s line “By returning differently,” which reframes his method and forces a choice. The tension is more contemplative than visceral, and could benefit from one sharper on-page cost or risk (e.g., Guild consequences) to heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether she can still believe in narrative as a way to live after confronting her own grave—is clear and sharpened by the scroll’s commands and the pressing dreams. Pressure escalates from eerie disquiet to the concrete act of sacrificing her written account to the snow, a quiet but real renunciation. Internal and external pressures (dreams pawing at the windows, time folding, future footprints) interweave effectively. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s no sharp reversal or forced trade-off beyond mood-deepening, which keeps it just shy of top-tier stakes work.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can find a form of meaningful “translation” and wonder despite permanent sensory loss—is signaled early and threads the story. Pressure escalates as she moves from routine work to an almost visionary reading of the screw, culminating in the recognition of the midwife’s act and her own decision to pocket the screw and step into the city’s breath. Cost is quiet but legible: she forecloses the fantasy of sensory restoration as the route to purpose and accepts a subtler, more ambiguous role. The conflict is internal and lyric rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it from feeling fully high-stakes but is appropriate to the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—can Lina rewrite the story of her brother’s fall without repeating or inverting the disaster—is clear and tested by the timing of the twelfth stroke and her held breath. Pressure escalates primarily through intensifying internal cost (burning lungs, needle-pain, memory shards) layered with external time/typhoon pressure. The decisive act is her commitment to finish the rune in spite of that pain and terror, and the visible price is her physical distress, the broken tool, and the irrevocable surfacing of memories. The conflict is mostly internal and could perhaps flirt with one more concrete external complication, but for this length the tightening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting and apologizing before the orchard and its music are erased—is clear early and tightens as tractors start and chainsaws bite. Escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric: the trembling drop, the ghost’s question, and the engines roaring outside compress her window to act. Her decisive choice to let the drop fall and speak a plain apology instead of a polished metaphor is a meaningful renunciation with cost. The conflict remains mostly one smooth ascent rather than featuring a sharp reversal, but within this mode it sustains tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are existential and internally consistent: whether she can unify endings and beginnings before being “expelled like smoke,” at the cost of her own separateness. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via reversals—through the activated spiral, the singing shelves, the arbitration sentence, then the draining of all memories into the dictionary and the final “puncture of self.” Her key acts (opening the dictionary, laying it on the axis, choosing to walk inward to dissolution) are clearly agentive and carry real cost. The only limiting factor is that conflict remains almost entirely conceptual; there’s little moment-to-moment friction or doubt to sharpen those choices.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Torvald’s need to reinterpret time and his role as shepherd—does escalate from uneasy observation to radical intervention when he turns the key counterclockwise. The anomaly (water flowing uphill, dissolving horizon) tightens pressure conceptually, culminating in his choice to let the system run backward and accept his own dissolution into the abstraction he’s pursued. However, the cost remains largely conceptual; we don’t deeply feel what he loses (self, station, ordinary grief) beyond the idea of it, so the tension never quite sharpens into pain. The conflict between human attachment (to his daughter, to his role) and transcendence could be pushed harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s chance to recover/resolve Luc—is clear early and escalates from abstract investigation to confronting two versions of her brother. The meaningful tightening comes when headset data reveals identical signatures, collapsing the “original vs copy” option and forcing a higher-cost merge attempt instead of a simple selection. Internal stakes (her grief, need for certainty) are nicely entwined with the speculative mechanics of folds and spores. The moment of choice is strong but could lean a touch more into fear of loss or failure to heighten on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira will reconfigure her stance toward her father’s legacy and her own risk appetite—is legible early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates primarily through deepening understanding rather than external obstacles: the turn from seeing the contradictions as traps to invitations is the key tightening. Her choice to seed the city with annotated pages and then to leave the lantern “for the next exception” forecloses the easier path of simple rejection or sentimental forgiveness. The conflict remains predominantly internal and could bear one more concrete on-page test of her new stance, but within this scale it still lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will stay in his closed loop or risk a new trajectory—is signaled early in his meticulous estrangement and escalates through the child’s calls, the invitation to “where the tunnel ends,” and the gate opening. The choice to hand her the disc instead of following her is a meaningful renunciation with cost, and the later act of cutting the wires is a second, sharper foreclosing of his old life. Internal and external stakes braid well: the emergency call and his refusal tie his inner shift to a concrete, ethically fraught moment. The pressure is primarily interior and could perhaps bear one more external complication, but it remains coherent and tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—saving the “weight of small moments” before the jetty is paved and reconciling public memory with private grief—are clear and present early. Pressure tightens via the engines, security, and ticking clock of tomorrow’s demolition, culminating in her decision to entomb the locket, which forecloses her ability to keep it as a private talisman. The conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than confrontational, but the story does show a visible price in that sacrifice. Escalation is subtle and steady rather than sharp, which suits the lyric mode but keeps the tension just shy of fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what to do with loneliness, both personally and communally—is clear and present early in Kit’s memories and the moon rock. Pressure escalates as the place transforms from private refuge to public ritual site, culminating in the clock’s lurch forward that forces a choice: stay and ossify the miracle or leave so the story doesn’t harden. The conflict is largely internal and situational rather than confrontational; no antagonist appears, but the “station’s future” and Kit’s own pattern of service vs. retreat create a real trade-off. The escalation is more lyrical deepening than sharply tested decision, which keeps it strong but not ferocious.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he will confront and coherently map his own emotional depths—is signaled early and fulfilled at the stillpoint. Escalation is primarily textural (ring growing heavier, melody tightening into a spiral, forest walls closing in) rather than event-driven, but the pattern clearly narrows toward a single charged choice: kneeling, removing the cane, touching the ground. The price of that choice—accepting sorrow, loss, and regret into his body as “rivers of unsent apology”—is legible and persists into the future. The only limitation is the relative absence of external or conflicting pressures beyond his own reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can redeem a damaging misinterpretation and restore meaningful communication—is clear and tied to her identity. Pressure escalates when the anomaly flares “silver,” the pen vibrates, and the log yields coordinates dated tomorrow, pushing her to act now. Her choice to unbend “Planting the Wrong Seeds” is a genuine, if quiet, turning point with some borrowed power cost (station lights dim, gravity slackens). The emotional and ethical price of altering history is more implied than fully dramatized, keeping stakes thoughtful but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates texturally rather than through direct opposition: the advisor circles the harbor stripping away sounds, the camera hums, and the final chord represents a clear intensification of the initial aim to “disrupt the town’s long hush.” Stakes—how grief, memory, and ownership of sound are reconfigured—are clear and become more emotionally charged as individual townspeople feel specific absences. However, there is little resistance or live alternative path; the advisor never appears at risk of failing or being opposed, so the sense of cost is more conceptual than dramatically contested. This keeps the conflict rich but relatively gentle compared to the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true history and fulfilling the grandmother’s promise—is signaled, and there is a mild deepening as Ember realizes the fires were meant to cleanse corrupted history. Yet there’s almost no real opposition: no danger of discovery, no physical hazard that requires a trade-off, no moral test beyond accepting the convenient revelation that she was right all along. The archive’s collapse arrives only after success and doesn’t force her into a hard choice, so the narrative never quite tightens around a costly decision. As a result, tension stays low and the story reads more like a lyrical revelation than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s ability to reclaim a livable sense of self without annihilating her entangled others—is established early and escalates from discomfort to desperate flight to a risky ritual. Her choice to enter the lagoon against the pull of memory-threads is a genuine tightening, foreclosing the option of passive endurance. The later shift from expulsion to harmonization is a credible deepening of the same conflict rather than a new problem. The emotional price of letting go registers, though the external risk (what exactly she might lose or damage) stays a touch abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering whether the whispered, storm-dependent mechanism and the grandmother’s story are real—remains coherent throughout. There is a meaningful tightening when they reach the seven-corridor junction and commit to testing the three-whisper sequence. However, external and internal resistance are both gentle; nothing serious threatens safety, reputation, or their relationship, so the price of failure feels low. The resolution is earned but operates at a low-pressure register, more discovery than tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether darkness can be re-taught to hold wonder rather than erase it—emerges early and tightens as she assembles and adjusts the shutter lattice. Escalation is subtle but present: the remembered child, the darkness “leaning closer,” the darkness’s wordless question, and her final choice to dim the lantern to privilege true starlight. The emotional cost is clear in her tears and the quiet acceptance that she cannot undo the past, only change the dark’s behavior going forward. Because conflict is almost entirely internal and symbolic, tension is rich but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether fixed games/rules can be quietly subverted—is clear and tightened through the mysterious note, the risk of curfew-breaking, and the decision to make the rebellion visible via windows rather than keep it private. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational: the mist “sharper,” the expanding circle of participants, the library itself joining in. The cost and risk remain mostly conceptual and atmospheric; no one is truly squeezed into a hard choice under threat, which keeps the pressure elegant but a touch low-stakes. Still, Mara’s choice to enact a town-wide, traceable act of defiance at curfew is a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will cling to a violent past or risk a tender, weaponless future at sea—is clear early and escalates as the island literally starts to “ghost.” Pressure tightens through the whale’s call, the island shudder, and the visible choice for people to step into the water and push fragments into a new shape. Lira’s agency is central: she initiates the ritual, reframes “detach” thematically, and sacrifices the scrimshaw to seal the shift. The cost is more internal and communal than life-or-death, but it’s convincingly felt for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to cultivate “lightness in grief” under a punitive hush—is clear and steadily pressured by the silence ordinance, surveillance, and the officer’s presence. Escalation is understated but real: her private ritual becomes a public micro-rebellion (crow’s feather in turbine, louder narration “so the ghosts…could hear”), then a shared act with the ex-officer and a planted “skeleton” that risks meaning. Still, much of the pressure remains atmospheric and philosophical rather than forcing a sharply foreclosing choice on the page. The cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can successfully paraphrase the law and unseal the lake without being trapped—is present and escalates as the pillars change key, fissures spread, and she steps onto unstable ice. The explicit risk of being frozen “a statue of precedent” grounds the abstract project in concrete peril. That said, the conflict leans conceptual and aesthetic more than visceral, so the sense of narrowing options never fully tightens into dread. Agency drives the turns, but the on-page cost remains more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—Milo’s need to transform his relationship to beauty and perception—intensifies from curiosity to profound, costly reorientation. Escalation is clear at the marble-eye moment and again when they smash their own creations, sacrificing hard-won work for a deeper statement. However, tension remains largely internal and aesthetic; there is little sense of risk beyond artistic/spiritual stakes, and no substantial reversal tests their bond or commitment. The pressure is coherent and deepening but not sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to loss and silence in a stabilized, electrified world—is signaled, but pressure remains abstract and largely unopposed. The key “turn” (her public question and subsequent song) triggers reconfiguration, yet the collectors’ rapid, compliant shift lacks visible resistance or price. There is little sense of a foreclosed alternative path; preservation is relinquished almost instantly once challenged. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth thematic unfolding than a sharpening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains frozen in grief or accepts transformation and returns to the living—is legible from early on. Pressure deepens as she repurposes each coordinate-bearing figure, culminating in dissolving the stencil and fixing a coordinate for her own departure, which forecloses the option of staying with her daughter’s echo. The cost is conceptually strong but emotionally underplayed; we don’t see her nearly choose to stay or visibly falter. As a result, the conflict feels meaningful yet somewhat pre-resolved, with limited sense of risk at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully map the patterns of cultural collapse before memory erodes—is clear, and it does deepen as she moves from card-reading to full-fledged cultural cartography. The key escalation is the discovery of the recurring leveraged-debt sigil that appears across quadrants, raising the conceptual cost: collapse is fractal and perhaps inescapable. However, pressure is mostly intellectual and ritualistic; there’s no hard on-page dilemma or concrete loss that forces a wrenching choice. The final act of sealing the tools and walking away registers as an earned stasis more than a sharply tested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will sacrifice identity to “purify” the archive or find another way to live with memory—is clear, and the offer to become the archive’s librarian is a meaningful tightening. Her decision to refuse solitary stewardship, leave, and then distribute the burden among survivors is driven by her agency and carries conceptual cost. However, the conflict remains largely abstract and symbolic; there is little concrete jeopardy or loss beyond the implied psychic cost of erasure or entrapment, so escalation feels more like deepened insight than genuine narrowing of options. The tension is steady but rarely sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether hope will be commodified, discarded, or preserved as something unshareable—is clear and tight, and the warming stone plus library tremor provide a meaningful tightening. Mira’s decision on the balcony (drop, keep, or internalize) functions as a genuine fork with conceptual and emotional cost. The shadow’s movement into and out of her body maps her internal conflict well. The only limitation is that the pressure is largely conceptual rather than situationally urgent, so tension hums rather than bites.

    The dominant stake—whether Miren can respond to her complicity without abandoning either her animals or her ethics—is clear early and tightens as she moves from symbolic self-stripping to handling the corpses and cutting their tails. Tension escalates via an ethical and emotional calculus rather than external antagonism, culminating in the decision to free Aster rather than keep her as proof of competence or penance. The price is tangible: she sacrifices control, status markers, and the illusion of harmless expertise for a more doubtful, risk-laden practice. The conflict remains mostly internal and could bear one sharper external pressure, but for this length it reads strong.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to finally transform unresolved grief into a bearable form—is legible early and tightens with the miracle’s demand: “Trade requires fresh loss.” The decisive act of reopening the scar and bleeding onto the miracle is a clear escalation with tangible cost. Internal and external conflicts interweave well: the magical bargain concretizes the emotional risk of closure. One potential deepening left on the table is a sharper articulation of what she risks losing in herself by letting go, beyond the implied identity-tie to the wound.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering her mother’s lost lyrics / finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and carried through to the end. Pressure escalates via the psychometry vision, self-threading film, and the revelation that the blank letter under her pillow has a counterpart in the balcony, culminating in her decision to inscribe new lyrics and burn the letter. However, most “reversals” arrive as gifts from the environment or magic (projector animating itself, door opening, letter pre-addressed), so Mara’s agency isn’t strongly tested against real opposition. The emotional payoff is clear, but the path feels relatively unresisted, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—either reclaim creativity or let it die for everyone—is clearly articulated and escalates as the meteors shift from enigmatic to imperative (“Create. / or / perish”). Pressure deepens when she realizes the sky is “warning itself” and when she decides to destroy the trusted instrument and then herself to answer that warning. Escalation is mostly internal and symbolic rather than dramatized through resistance or obstacles, and the external threat never has a concrete agent pushing back. As a result, the tension feels resonant but somewhat rarified, lacking one more grounded complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether lost dreams/songs can be re-routed into new carriers—is clear and sharpened as wave-function hands, pages, and pollen children all appear. There is a meaningful tightening when the clock begins moving “backward” and “forward,” forcing the guard to choose to plant it and relinquish his longstanding ritual. The guard’s action resolves the pressure credibly, with conceptual cost (time reconfigured; forest and children bound together) but little felt risk or resistance. Tension operates more as solemn inevitability than true jeopardy, which keeps the conflict effective but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—retain a coherent, rooted self or surrender to a distributed, wonder-forward mind—is signaled early and steadily tightened. The major escalation comes with the jaguar’s demand that she “give away the thing that keeps you rooted,” forcing a real trade-off with visible loss. Internal and external pressures align well, though antagonism is mostly existential rather than situational, which softens moment-to-moment tension. Consequences are clear and lasting: she forecloses the path of returning to the metro and accepts transformation into part of the forest’s machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the guardian so crossings can resume safely—is clear, and the broken leash is a good inciting disruption. Pressure escalates somewhat as they follow indirect, reality-twisting routes toward the hound’s mournful howl. Yet there is little real resistance or risk in the confrontation; the hound yields quickly to soothing and a symbolic gesture, and we never see a concrete cost to failure. The story reads more like a pilgrimage to a foregone healing than a hard-won resolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the fortress’s enforced silence is worth its human cost—is clearly signaled and coherently pressured by the boy’s mutilation and surgery. Escalation is quiet but real: from generalized history of silence to the specific, immediate price in this boy’s body and the live possibility he will or will not “stay” in this world. Agency is endurance and attention rather than dramatic choice; the bellhop’s practiced remaining, and transferring the bolt, crystallize his stance with a visible emotional cost. The pressure could edge higher with one more on-page complication or risk, but for a lyric piece it tightens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic/historical balance by unmasking a false king—is clear and tracks through to the sundering. Pressure escalates from long-term search to a focused confrontation night, then to the ink touching skin and the glamour failing. Yet the titan never seems in danger; the guards’ arrival is neutralized almost effortlessly, and no alternative loss scenario is felt. As a result, the conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically cushioned, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the erased Path 27 can be recovered or understood—emerges clearly and tightens as anomalies compound (metal answering back, atlas fragment, tapping from below). There is credible escalation from eerie signal to physical descent into an alien ruin and the activation of an unknown technology. However, opposition is largely atmospheric rather than agentive; danger, risk, or potential failure are implied but never quite bite, so her choices don’t clearly foreclose competing goods or expose her to visible harm. The internal and external conflicts braid effectively, but the tension profile feels more contemplative-mysterious than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the lull in rebellion becomes surrender or renewal—is clear, and pressure coheres as her song and the stone’s hum escalate from private resonance to planetary broadcast. Escalation is present, particularly once consoles blink awake and the shuttle shudders to life, but obstacles are mostly implicit; nothing pushes back on her, and each step succeeds on the first attempt. The cost of leaving and the risk of broadcasting on militia channels are conceptually present but not sharply dramatized as trade-offs. As a result, tension feels textured and atmospheric more than sharply constricting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—wresting reproductive destiny from the council—is signaled early and tightened when the kite appears, when the exact grotto temperature is revealed, and when the guard arrives, creating a clear time-pressure corridor. Nara’s agency drives every turn, especially her decision to nick the sac and scramble the programming under immediate threat. The internal vs external conflict braid is effective: her ideological aim (evolve tradition) is tested by embodied risk and limited time. The main weakness is that the guard is neutralized almost effortlessly by plant magic, slightly undercutting the felt cost of that escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how to live with catastrophic grief without erasing it—is clear from early on and remains coherent. Escalation occurs through deepening, not external reversal: the invented “freeze” exercise, then the resin-transfer, then the harder choice of letting the photo go. Agency is quiet but real: they refuse the option of self-erasure at the cliff and instead choose a costlier endurance (living “as the trees live”). The only slight limitation is that conflict remains purely internal, so pressure is intense but not varied across different external fronts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can reconcile art, memory, and loss without obliterating himself—tightens effectively as the lighthouse literally and metaphorically closes in. Escalation tracks: the environment grows more hostile, the cards reconfigure into something unstable, the stairs lead down instead of up, and the ticking collapse before sunrise forces a choice at the mirror. His agency in redesigning the card and then choosing to step through the painted door ties internal conflict to external stakes (drowning vs. staying in a doomed tower). Still, conflict remains primarily internal and aesthetic; a slightly clearer articulation of what survival would mean for him could sharpen the sense of forfeited alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will embrace the temporal fold and join Lyra, losing his old life—is signaled early and sharpened by the revelation that others (mother, Lyra) chose to vanish. Escalation comes through deepening knowledge (Lyra’s theory, the desert’s defense mechanism, the portal vision) rather than external obstacles, which works but keeps tension more intellectual than visceral. Kael’s final decision forecloses a major path, yet he moves toward it with relatively little hesitation or competing impulse on the page, so the price feels understood more than agonized over. Conflict is coherent and present, but could benefit from one harder test or reversal before the leap.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—duty to the council and archive versus duty to unedited truth—is clear and sharpened by the risk of personal erasure and potential mob destruction of the library. Pressure escalates coherently: discovery of the letter, decision to steal and move, hazardous crawl and upload, then the audible arrival of citywide consequences while she chooses sedation over flight or further intervention. The moral calculus (truth that may trigger book-burning) credibly narrows her options into a costly stance. The main limitation is that antagonistic pressure remains abstract/institutional and entirely offstage, slightly muting visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will metabolize her father’s violent legacy—is clear, and her choice to weave the scrap into the roses is a meaningful stance. However, there is minimal escalation: once she decides on her ritual, no new objection, doubt, or external pressure complicates that path. The work-through-the-night montage suggests endurance but not a true test of resolve or a foreclosed alternative. As a result, tension is more meditative than actively sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will “catch the echo of a goddess” without sacrificing her chosen composure—sharpens when the goddess threatens to “burn the garden silent” unless Mara offers her cry. This ultimatum meaningfully narrows options and forces a trade-off between direct emotional exposure and an indirect, more dangerous tactic. Escalation is clear as the vibrations funnel into the spike and begin to unmake the goddess and constellations; Mara’s decision drives resolution rather than coincidence. The price is somewhat soft-focused (she gains more than she visibly loses), but her acceptance of ongoing entanglement with the goddess’s “unfinished sentence” prevents the conflict from feeling costless.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether regret’s orbit, and thus Cordelia’s identity as “the liar’s daughter,” can change—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates as each logical inscription fails or partially succeeds, culminating in the orbit’s flare and refusal when confronted with her new evidence, which forces the costly choice to break the heirloom nib. Internal and external conflict interlock: the magical-logic confrontation with the orbit is also a test of whether she’ll remain bound by inherited guilt. The resolution feels earned through her agency; the only reason this isn’t higher is that external opposition (beyond the orbit’s resistance) is minimal, keeping the pressure very intimate rather than sharply multi-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can quiet her guilt and the boy’s unfinished lullaby without becoming another trapped sound—is signaled early and tightened through each menu choice. The revelation that the lab cultivates lost sounds, not just stores them, deepens the conflict into a moral/ontological choice. The final triad of options (UPGRADE / BECOME LULLABY / RELEASE INSECT) offers a genuine trade-off, with “release” both morally costly and personally risky. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, but it coheres under the hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can accept impermanence as the locus of meaning—is evident early and tightened as the hush “congregates” and her own voice feels increasingly intrusive. The meaningful turn comes when she answers the silent question by sweeping a spiral into a straight path and then, more decisively, destroys the mandala, foreclosing the path of preservational art. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than external, but it’s clear in the abandonment of her prior orientation to her work and the acceptance that its erasure is “the final, necessary stroke.” The escalation is more meditative than sharp, which may limit visceral tension but suits the piece’s chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Asha chooses to live with catastrophic cultural loss and the ethics of remembering versus forgetting—is clear and coherent. Pressure builds as she assigns specific memories to each tessera and commits to releasing them, culminating in the conscious construction of “empathy’s armor” and her departure from the city. The internal cost is legible, but the conflict largely avoids sharp dilemmas or reversals; she does not seriously consider an alternative course in the on-page present. As a result, tension feels steady and thoughtful rather than tightening to a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming possibility/continuity of self through performance—remains coherent and escalates as the ritual turns from private yearning into a full temporal reweaving. Pressure deepens when Lila appears and forces him to reframe applause as “luring possibility,” then peaks as they bind echoes to the quince tree and condense everything into one heartbeat. The decisive change (his outline sharpening, carrying an “endless encore”) is clearly tied to his actions rather than coincidence. Still, the conflict stays contemplative; there’s little sense of risk that the attempt could fail or harm him, which softens the perceived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to block overwhelming telepathic noise—is strong on paper, and the static shock provides a clear inciting turn. However, after that, conflict is almost entirely one-way discovery: her experiments yield breakthroughs swiftly, Mrs. Chen’s test works immediately, and community adoption follows without friction, trade-offs, or visible failures. There is no real reversal or escalation beyond “learning more of the network,” and no scene where a live option is foreclosed in a way that bites. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt, which keeps tension serviceable but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Aera can authentically give voice to the unknown without being annihilated by it—tightens nicely when she chooses to merge with the fossil and again when she releases her nonverbal “weather” voice. Internal and external pressures interweave: her method inverts, the cave goes blind, and she risks herself to create a new guiding object. However, opposition remains largely abstract (no counter-force beyond implication of self-loss and extinction), so tension is rich but somewhat one-directional, with limited sense of alternate paths foreclosed on the page. The escalation is satisfying but more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the future remains a rigid prophecy or becomes shared, revisable work—is clear and reweighted by the end. Pressure escalates texturally: from the cracked hourglass and “broken” future to the trembling jar to the all-at-once button silence and her decision to reseal and carry the echo into the world. The conflict stays largely conceptual and interior, so the sense of risk feels more contemplative than urgent. Still, her final choice forecloses a path (obedient prophecy-turner) and commits to a costlier role (ongoing, relational responsibility), which is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stakes—exposing the director’s betrayal and trying to atone for past silence—are clear early, and there is one meaningful tightening as he overcomes the dead keypad and limited power to record and schedule a multi-frequency burst. His decisive act of transmitting and smashing the pillbox carries real cost and crystallizes his internal conflict. However, the story largely lacks reversals or materially narrowing options; external antagonistic pressure is more implied than dramatized, so tension remains steady rather than mounting sharply. The result is strong but more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the coachman will cling to his identity as ferryer or submit to having his life distilled and the crossing erased—is clear and grows as they leave the coach and the gutters’ ticking ceases. Escalation is subtle but real: boarding, accepting the needle, threading his last story, abandoning the coach, and swallowing the droplet each foreclose options. The cost (surrendering his profession and familiar world) is implicit yet felt in the imagery of the coach groaning apart and the palimpsest wiped clean. The pressure is more contemplative than agonistic, which suits the piece but keeps it a notch below peak-intensity conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is metaphysical/emotional: can this dead oasis be coaxed into a living, time-stitching kindness rather than calcified memory. Pressure escalates via the deepening thrum, the fractured timelines, and the risk of whether bees will accept an unfired hive. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided—there is little real resistance or alternative path dramatized, so the sense of risk feels gentle rather than acute. The final handoff to the child deepens consequence but doesn’t hinge on a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—bringing literal and figurative light to the boy trapped in the dark stairwell—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates once Mara commits theft and lock-tampering; the descent into darkness and the quiet test of whether the boy will follow her upward give the middle beats some tension. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided: the door opens without real resistance, there is no direct confrontation with authority, and the risk of being caught stays conceptual rather than dramatized. The emotional stakes still land, but the external stakes could tighten further without betraying the piece’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept shared ancestral memory or remain singular—is clearly signaled and tightens when the hum offers “let us share the weight of being last.” The major escalation occurs as the memories press against her bones, forcing an immediate, high-cost decision about identity and agency. Her refusal is not static but a sharpened stance that visibly costs her (“The brittle awakening…cracked further”) while opening a different, lonelier path. Conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative, but tension is maintained through the circle’s pressure and the risk of self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue as invisible conduit or rejoin the world as herself—is clearly signaled and carried through. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: color-voices of past letters surround her, her own memories surface onto her skin, and the twig crumbles, tightening the pressure to choose a new stance. Her active decisions (placing the nest, allowing the transfer, adding her own line, walking away without looking back) provide an earned resolution with conceptual cost. The piece intentionally avoids sharp reversals, so tension is more meditative than urgent, which slightly softens felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing external manipulation from tipping a divided town into violence—is clear and present from the outset, with pressure escalating through the probes, the first counter-wave, the near-overload of the equipment, and the adversary’s frequency-hopping adaptation. Lyra’s decision to abandon the predictable sine wave and risk chaos (the glacier recording) is a genuine tightening that sacrifices control for a chance at efficacy. The conflict between her cautious, methodical nature and the need to “sacrifice certainty” is thematically strong, though the ethical cost remains relatively abstract (no concrete on-page harm or near-miss tied to her interference). Tension holds throughout, but a slightly more visceral sense of what failure would look like on the ground could push the stakes even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the key versus enduring/extinguishing her claustrophobia and losing access to the tunnels—is clearly signaled and escalates coherently. Pressure tightens as the organ sound violates reality, the geometry rebels, and then the descent into a literal claustrophobic shaft culminates in the mirror-chamber bargain. The decisive choice (to take the key knowing the tunnels will close) is a real trade-off with a visible cost to her world and identity, not a simple reward. One possible further heightening would be a more tangible external risk (physical danger) to accompany the psychological and existential stakes, but as-is, the conflict still lands strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Juniper can pierce her own protective erasure to recover the lost babysitter and thus rehumanize the cold case—is signaled early and escalates coherently. Tension tightens especially at the moment she discovers human hair in the ribbon, chooses to cut her palm, and forces the unification of blood and silk, paying a price in pain and psychic exposure. Internal and external conflicts interweave: her method and face-blindness collide with institutional erasure (burned evidence, last detective) in a way that forces a stance. The conflict is largely internal/lyric rather than confrontational, but the cost and narrowing of options still feel legible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering and legitimizing Edda’s erased bravery as a way to redeem Mara’s exile—is set up clearly and tightened when Voss threatens to report her. The key escalation beat is Mara’s question that flips Voss from potential antagonist to collaborator, followed by the dirigible expedition that literalizes the risk. However, opposition often yields quickly: the cipher decodes without meaningful setbacks, Voss changes sides after one exchange, the wreck yields its log without complication, and the Ministry grants reversal in a day. The emotional and thematic stakes carry tension, but external conflict feels somewhat under-tested for a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether she will remain bound to “never” or risk stepping into an impossible bridge-world—is clear and escalates from contemplation to irreversible action. Pressure tightens through the vibrating flake, the appearance of the doorway, and the wireframe hitchhiker offering his hand, culminating in her crushing the flake and stepping onto the unfinished bridge. Internal and external conflicts braid elegantly via the memory of her father’s fall. The cost of departure is emotionally legible but could be made slightly more concrete (what she leaves behind) for maximal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Jonah will remain trapped in inherited and startup-failure loops or choose a new path—is clear and does progress. Pressure deepens when Mara appears with a mirrored failure, forcing Jonah to confront his ritual as something more than private nostalgia, and the burning of the shirts plus the exchange of relics sharpen the choice to part. However, tension is relatively low-key throughout; there is little sense that any option is truly dangerous or irrecoverable beyond emotional cost. The story earns its quiet resolution, but a more palpable on-page price paid in the moment could heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether sorrow can be reconfigured from isolating burden into shared light—is coherent, and the pressure does deepen from mere curiosity to an existential recognition that her own insomnia and swallowed stories are implicated. However, escalation is mostly smooth revelation; there is little genuine threat of failure, resistance from the world, or hard trade-off beyond internal reframing. The star’s predicted dimming and the “before the next variable star dimmed” line promise a clock but do not meaningfully narrow options once the vision starts. The final stance is earned but feels more like a granted vision than something wrestled toward under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she will actually confess and accept the cost of her betrayal—is signaled early and tightened via the dangerous traversal (roots, apples like skulls) and the blood-bond with the seed. The decisive escalation is the stilling at the seventh circle and the lake’s silver eye, which corners her: the trick “refused her cowardice,” removing the option of a painless, frozen confession. Speaking the truth triggers concrete consequences (the seed’s growth, the vortex’s reversal, her half-binding), making the resolution feel earned rather than symbolic only. Pressure is predominantly internal but well-interwoven with external magical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will sacrifice their freedom to maintain the covenant between city and soil—is signaled early (“Tonight the debt came due”) and tightens steadily as maze visions reveal the consequences of breaking it. Conflict escalates from invitation and curiosity to a binary, high-cost decision: withdraw and allow a “monoculture of glass,” or stay and root permanently, joining the fireflies. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn: “I let the maze drink,” a clear, irreversible act that resolves the pressure. Stakes are primarily internal/ethical but remain viscerally grounded in body, blood, and environment rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—what the narrator will sacrifice to mend his war-shredded self—is clearly signaled and tightened when Lira rejects his “expendable” sunrise memory and demands the mother’s hum. The corridor narrowing, root “wires,” and warning about backing out now effectively escalate pressure into a credible, costly choice. The later beat where he offers to trade away the entire orchard memory adds a second, thematically rich test of his commitment. Escalation is more moral/emotional than situationally dangerous, so tension stays low-key rather than nerve-tight, but it remains coherent and compounding.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mason has any meaningful purpose or livelihood left after public disgrace—is clear and present early, and the quarry visit feels like a last-ditch, low-agency errand that could confirm his failure. Pressure deepens when he discovers the Polaroid and then chooses to act (patching the mic and speaking the unfinished set-list) instead of just returning the check and retreating. That choice triggers both the physical echo and the foreman’s new offer, resolving the external and internal stakes together. Escalation is quietly handled and could bear a slightly sharper on-page sense of risk, but it remains coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can bridge absence and presence to restore the archive and reframe her mother’s loss—is signaled early and tightened through the seed’s initial failure, the arbor’s tilt, and the unsettling mirror-world reveal. Her agency drives the key turns: choosing to plant, to interpret the clicks, to hum the lullaby, to accept and walk through her mother’s pattern, and to step onto the new plank. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual (letting grief become grammar rather than body), which does land but could be sharpened with one more concrete risk or potential failure moment. Tension is more lyrical than visceral, but it escalates in a coherent way under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing identities from scattering into “storms of forgetting” so future children can find stories—is clear, but tension operates at a low, meditative hum rather than sharp escalation. The one meaningful tightening is the moon’s descent and the warning that after tomorrow the catalog becomes unreliable, which credibly pushes her to act now, plant the creel, and accept her own future forgetting. However, there’s little sense that any real option is foreclosed beyond the conceptual; she never appears on the verge of failing or choosing differently. The result is beautiful, but more charged than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain an inspector of tombs or become something riskier and more open—is present and tightened as she moves from professional distance into personal confession and finally self-sacrifice. The key turn is her decision to don the crown and speak her fear aloud, which forecloses her return to the convoy and ordinary human life. However, overt resistance or countervailing stakes (e.g., survival, duty to others above) are underplayed, so escalation feels more like an inevitable deepening than contested conflict. The cost is clear at the end but the pressure on the way there is more atmospheric than actively adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can confront her guilt and move toward self-forgiveness without the buffer of lithium—is clear from the outset and tightens as she descends and engages the stream. The key escalation is the decision to step into the water and surrender the accordion, converting a symbolic investigation into a personal sacrifice. Internal and external pressures weave well (withdrawal fragility, ancestral baggage, the eerie setting), and the price of her choice is palpable in losing her father’s last gig relic. The conflict remains largely internal but avoids stasis by anchoring each inner turn in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering her voice versus being subsumed by the library—is present and narrows toward a real trade-off at the end when she removes the golden thread. Escalation occurs via intensifying conditions (heavier watch, dimming shelves, nearing gravity inversion, library revealed as predatory and alive) that conceptually heighten the cost of any choice. However, the nine-hour deadline and “doors sealing for another century” stay abstract; no concrete attempt or near-failure dramatizes that temporal pressure. Conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, effective but not maximally sharpened into hard on-page dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—intervene and precipitate famine and political upheaval, or stay “neutral” and preserve an empire of conquest—is clearly stated and escalates from quiet dread to an explicit, irreversible choice. The ticking clock (moon, promise’s glow) and new knowledge from the coffee stain effectively tighten options, while the cereus’s rooting of her ankles literalizes being locked into a decision. The cost is legible both globally (shortened summers, fallen dynasty) and personally (her professional ethic compromised, exhaustion and moral burden). The conflict trades mostly in interior and conceptual pressure; a slightly longer beat of visceral hesitation before she draws the bow could intensify the peak, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving a last spark of wonder/memory versus losing her own—is established early and tightened as the spark’s impending oblivion looms. Escalation comes from the ritual nearing completion and the realization that the spark is hers, which forces a genuine trade-off with visible cost. Pressure is more existential and lyric than visceral, but the final step into the pool and surrender of self feel like a meaningful test of commitment. A slightly stronger sense of competing options (e.g., any non-sacrificial alternative) could deepen the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she will pursue numbing transcendence or re-enter the wounded valley to accept and transform debt—is clear early and tightened as the boy starts to dissipate. Her agency in stabbing the hairpin into the cliff and later choosing descent over remaining aloft makes the key turns character-driven rather than fated. The moral/emotional cost is evident in allowing the boy to fall and in accepting that rebirth demands a death and a return to the site of loss. The conflict is primarily internal and lyric, so tension is felt more as pressure and inevitability than as sharp reversals, slightly softening the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the team will anesthetize their guilt enough to proceed with destructive drilling—appears early and tightens as the chime messages grow more explicit, culminating in “killing something ancient that will never return.” Mira escalates the pressure by departing from her usual service and offering a stark alternative (keep the ill-fitting coat of certainty, or stand “naked with the truth”). The cost is the researchers’ loss of moral cover and investor-facing certainty, and the acceptance of grief and ethical ambiguity. The only limitation is that external consequences (investors, careers, project) remain offstage, so the stakes stay primarily conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and metaphysical—whether Marcus will truly understand the nature of vanishing and his own fate—which is conceptually rich but dramatically under-pressured. The escalation is mostly formal (each successive ring revealing more) rather than arising from contested choice; Marcus never resists, doubts, or risks much beyond receiving knowledge. Elara’s cost—vanishing—is predetermined by her condition, not quite sharpened into a present-tense dilemma. It’s an elegant pattern but lacks one strong beat of active, pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Cael will successfully locate and integrate the wandering pulse / learn to “navigate without moving”—is clearly flagged, but the pressure around it is gentle. Escalation comes mostly from intensifying resonance (the hum of the towers, the birds’ formations, the arrowhead heating and merging) rather than from resistance or cost, so the journey feels fated rather than contested. His agency (choosing to sing, to press the arrowhead into his chest, to stand still) does drive the turn, yet those choices face no real alternative or risk. The lack of a palpable threat or sacrifice keeps the conflict band solid but not high.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Elian’s fight to reclaim unmetered wonder from a system that quantifies luminance—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates meaningfully when the algorithms detect the mist and begin sealing the air, forcing him to commit to mist walking and to articulate his core desire to the keystone/mist. The keystone choice and badge-sacrifice narrow his options sharply, leaving him without credentials or path back, while granting him a different kind of agency. The conflict is more existential than combative, but internal and external threads (automation vs sacred, safety vs invisibility) interlock well.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Jin’s existential/artistic quest weighed against the physical risk and the sanctity of the drowned vows. Escalation is gentle and accumulative rather than sharply conflict-driven: his descent, the fragile deck, the safe’s opening, and the swelling of overlapping voices. The captain’s final instruction gives Jin a clear directive and he follows it, but the choice is not heavily contested on the page. Tension is present yet remains more lyrical than pressured, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether any purpose is possible at the end of the universe and what it will cost Lira personally—is signaled early and tightened as the ritual’s implications emerge. The key escalation is the revelation that “the distillate was not knowledge but sacrifice,” which forces her into a concrete, irreversible choice to swallow the coins and surrender her role. The cost is clear (loss of identity, embodiment, and autonomy) and reverberates into the final image of her as waveform. The conflict is primarily internal and metaphysical, so tension is more meditative than gripping, but it remains coherent and deepens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can he understand/name the fear that haunts his work and what it has cost others—emerges early and tightens steadily. Pressure escalates via revelations that raise the personal price: the girl on the plague cot, the brother’s accusing reflection, and the written ledger that his existence has been bought in fractions of others’ deaths. His response is active (releasing voices, reconfiguring the atlas into “paper souls,” choosing a new way of walking), and the internal cost is clear. The conflict remains primarily interior and metaphysical, but it doesn’t feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake (will belief, focused through Kael and the bell, be enough to bring back the sea?) is clear and scales from personal experiment to civilizational survival. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational—drip rates doubling, minnows to dolphins to whales, solitary vigil to communal ritual—but the pressure does grow, especially around the brittle nature of faith. The main limitation is that opposition remains abstract; no on-page force pushes back beyond implied forgetfulness and entropy, so tension is more meditative than sharp. Still, the cost of devotion (Kael’s spent life and the fragility of the system) is legible by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what Marisol will do with the painful, complicating truth about her father and the town’s past—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates through the photograph trail to the Polaroid’s revelation, forcing a choice between exposing private scandal and reorienting toward collective memory, with the visible cost of relinquishing her last tangible link to that alternate life. Conflict is mostly internal and quiet, but it coheres and deepens rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can and will risk using the crystal to merge logic and wonder before the “final transformation”—is clearly marked and does deepen as she finds, then activates, then dissolves the crystal. The key tightening is her decision to lower the crystal into the flame despite knowing it could “unravel the seam,” a credible convergence of internal and external stakes. However, tension remains mostly contemplative; we never feel a sharp narrowing of options or a palpable nearness of catastrophic consequences beyond atmosphere. As a result, the conflict feels resonant but never fully sharp-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the secrecy and integrity of the watcher network—is clearly signaled and tightened by the intruder’s intimate knowledge of her codes. Pressure escalates as recognition of pattern theft gives way to the encounter with her older self and the explicit test voiced over the radio. Her final act of surrendering the buckle forecloses the path of endless vigilance and accepts a real loss of control. The external cost to the network remains mostly conceptual rather than concretely dramatized, which slightly mutes the visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes—custody of the child and literal ontological survival through the next rewrite—are established early and stay legible. Pressure escalates via the confession rounds vivifying the brain and especially when Zero falters at naming his first fear of love, which tightens the conflict from ritual performance to raw vulnerability. The rewrite bell serves as a credible external clock that forces a decision: compete and erase one self, or merge and accept the cost of losing both separate identities. The resolution is earned and consequential, though the contest phase could carry a touch more friction or near-failure before the synthesis choice to feel fully knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the escape rooms from becoming lethal or inescapable—is signaled early and conceptually high. There is one meaningful tightening: the second-thunderclap deadline tied to the mysterious, self-authored note, which pushes Mira to act. However, once she plants the seed, opposition is minimal; she quickly masters the brass levers and reroutes growth into puzzles, so there’s little on-page resistance, sacrifice, or genuine risk to guests. The climax plays more as a successful calibration of wonder than a pressured trade-off, keeping conflict strong in idea but relatively gentle in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether Ellery can transform suffocating silence into something that admits Quinn’s laughter—is established early and escalates as he moves from raw noise to careful modulation. The key tightening comes with the impossible sniffle and his decision to persist, risking emotional re-injury for the chance of connection. The price is legible: he doesn’t get Quinn back, only a fragile, mediated echo, and must live with that limit. The conflict is primarily internal/textural rather than confrontational, which fits the piece but keeps the pressure in a more subdued register.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will step through, resolve her homesickness, or remain in charged relationship with uncertainty—is clear and sharpened by the glimpse of the warm, unfrozen garden. Escalation is subtle but present: from ritual offering/withdrawing of the pendant to the boundary parting and revealing a live alternative, then her placing the pendant down and turning away. The cost is the quiet but real renunciation of potential passage and answers, in favor of an ongoing, companionable uncertainty. The piece does, however, remain primarily contemplative, with tension expressed texturally rather than through strongly felt urgency, which limits the sense of high-stakes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform a dead creed into a living, riskier thing—is signaled early and escalates coherently through the high-cost ritual and subsequent sacrifice of his sight. Pressure tightens as each ingredient is added, culminating in the creature’s unsettling caveat that “the next cage may be stranger,” which forces a meaningful acceptance rather than triumph. Agency drives every turn; nothing is solved by coincidence. The main ceiling is that the conflict remains largely philosophical and ritualized—there’s limited concrete resistance beyond the inherent danger of the act and its implied social fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—preventing the shard of hush from consuming all transmissions—shifts into a deeper conflict about how to relate to endings and silence. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual, intensifying when she discards assumptions and commits the star fragment to the circuit. The piece earns a meaningful tightening (from “threat” to “cocoon” with the cost of sacrifice), but the external threat dissipates quickly once reinterpreted, keeping pressure at a reflective rather than visceral level. The conflict is strong but somewhat cushioned by inevitability and lyrical certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Arden can save the ferry and its ghostly passengers by choosing a timeline—is clear and escalates well. Pressure tightens as the ferry becomes half-real, commuters flicker, the grotto physically closes, and the hourglass burns in his pocket, forcing a time-bounded, moral-ontological decision. His agency drives the major turns: reading the coordinates, using the radio, steering via patterns, and finally choosing to flip and reverse the hourglass to merge rather than sacrifice. The cost is somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized (we don’t see the “other” casualties), which keeps the stakes just shy of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is clearly signaled and followed, and pressure accumulates via the gallery awakening, the thread heating/glowing, and the revelation that the gallery is a neural network. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; there is no real resistance, risk of failure, or alternative path she might choose. The main tightening is the gallery speaking through the composite man and the subsequent realization, which works conceptually but never feels perilous or costly on the page. The result is a strong but low-tension escalation suited to lyric mode rather than a fully pressurized crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether navigation can still grant meaningful direction/hope in a broken cosmos—is clear early and sharpened by the boy’s question about “going back.” Escalation is quiet but real: from abstract teaching, to the boy’s personal fear, to the grueling one-on-one lesson where his fingers “bled rust.” The key tightening is her choice to give away the link and invest her hard-won skill in a single student. The conflict remains largely internal/ethical rather than external, but it does culminate in a tangible price and a narrowed path.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lila’s voice and the donors’ contributions will be erased or protected—is clear from the outset and escalates in coherent steps (discovery, archive breach, data capture, confrontation). The main tightening comes when Hask corners her at the koi pond and she must decide between sacrificing physical artifacts or relying on the uploaded proof, which meaningfully alters tactics. Internal moral stakes (lying to power, ending the program, retiring the aid) interweave with external stakes without melodrama. The only limitation is that Hask offers relatively little active countermove before emotionally collapsing, softening the climax’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stakes—Mara’s need to bear witness vs the psychic/physical threat of the signal and her claustrophobia—are signaled early and tighten effectively as the tunnel narrows and the physics thicken. Escalation is accumulative and causal: each technician found, each name spoken, and the thinning of the gold lacquer increase both risk and moral commitment. Her choice to engage Voss and help reverse the phase transition serves as the key pressure turn, with a credible conceptual and emotional cost (she trades private survival for permanent responsibility). The conflict remains focused; no beat feels like a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core stakes—how to live with a life granted by error, and whether he can extract “wisdom” before the bureaucratic correction erases him—are clearly signaled. Pressure escalates as he commits to the ink ritual, slices back into flesh, and confronts the clerk, narrowing his options from ghostly observation to embodied moral engagement. The time constraint of dawn and the implied risk of losing his anomalous existence give the night’s actions weight. Conflict is largely internal and philosophical but remains grounded enough in concrete acts to avoid feeling abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central conflict—preserving a dying language versus surviving the diamond’s curse—intensifies steadily from approach, to tentative activation, to full bodily surrender. Escalation is clear: entering the tunnel, awakening the curse, heart slowing, then voluntary ingestion of the diamond, with options narrowing at each step. The price is explicit and permanent: she calcifies into a statue while enabling the language’s continuance. If anything, the conflict stays thematically focused rather than introducing additional complicating pressures, but for this length it feels proportionate and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara remains a debunking human researcher or yields to the moth-chorus and its “harmony untamed”—is present and escalates via the arrowhead warming, the bruise unfurling, and the chorus’s demand to “break the sky.” Pressure does increase, and her ascent to the rooftop is a clear tightening, but the internal tension at the peak is underplayed; she moves relatively smoothly into acceptance with minimal visible hesitation or sense of sacrifice. The external conflict is largely atmospheric rather than oppositional, which suits the mode but softens the feeling of hard trade-off. Still, the final act is the protagonist’s choice, and it credibly resolves the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the orchard from calcifying into pure mechanism—is clear early, and tension does escalate from a single statue noticing her to orchestrating a full system-wide transformation. The main tightening is when the guardian looks up and she must rely on the precise arrhythmic code, and later when she plays the lullaby backward to trigger wider change. However, opposition remains largely notional: every tactic she tries works, and the statues never seriously threaten her or force a hard trade-off, which softens the sense of risk. The cost of success is more ethereal than pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering devoured promises and reconnecting the displaced—is established early and tied to personal history (mother, brother) and political danger (illegal love, contraband letters). There is a clear tightening as Riven moves from covert arcade ritual to irreversible action at the mailbox, with the trade of the storm reading as the main price point. However, external antagonism (drone, guards, border regime) never fully constrains him on the page; the drone is a hovering threat rather than an active obstacle, so escalation feels more like ritual progression than contested struggle. The emotional and conceptual stakes land, but the scene could benefit from at least one more concrete, resisting force or jeopardized option.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his relationship to silence from void to possibility—is signaled early and tightened effectively as he moves from skepticism into direct contact with the halo’s truth. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the eerie search, the disorienting corridor, the uncanny pool, the impossible horses’ song, and finally his non-verbal singing that rewrites the water. The cost is real but quiet: he relinquishes his self-erasure and commits to a path of listening and leaving, with the train and halo no longer external refuges. Because the pressure remains contemplative rather than sharply oppositional (no active resistance, little sense of risk of failure), the stakes feel profound but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—her desire to find where stories live and understand her role—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening when she steps into the “negative space” and recognizes herself as the observer collapsing story-wavefunctions. However, opposition and cost are mostly implicit; nothing seriously resists her, and her choice to go deeper feels like a natural continuation rather than a pressured decision. Escalation reads as increasing conceptual density rather than rising danger or loss. The result is thematically rich but low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the dream/cipher to restore erased voices at personal cost—is clear and escalates through the journey to the islet, the painting of light, and the chase of the paper boat. The meaningful tightening occurs when she steps into the tide and paints a “corridor of gold,” risking herself and her unnamed memory to coax the dream close enough to capture. The payoff (implosion of light, palette cracking, cipher inscribed in her veins) delivers a real price, but the dream’s cooperation reads a touch smooth; there’s little resistance or serious possibility of failure on the page. Tension is more conceptual and atmospheric than viscerally suspenseful, which suits the mode but keeps the pressure just shy of maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea at the cost of self—is clear from the outset and tightens as she moves from rumor-following to an irreversible personal trade. Escalation is well handled: choosing the specific gate, entering a corridor that erases years, then confronting the muzzled cub where the price becomes explicit (“shards would fly forward into futures she would never remember, scattering her name”). Her agency at the mirror directly drives the resolution and cost. The conflict remains mostly internal and symbolic, so the pressure is intense but somewhat one-note rather than facing layered external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will trade more of herself for numbing forgetfulness or reclaim painful memory—is legible early and crystallizes at the mushroom’s demand that she “complete the exchange.” Pressure escalates from eerie investigation to a clear, ethically and emotionally loaded choice around the sextant and cap. Her agency drives the turn: choosing the scalpel and concocting a “return journey” instead of yielding to the ring. The price (losing the protective silence she once chose) is present but more implied than dramatized, keeping tension strong but shy of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stakes—Lira’s choice between self-sacrificial return that saves the library versus enduring exile to preserve memory and mentor another—are clear, and the tea-leaf reading usefully tightens pressure by framing a specific, costly alternative. Escalation is more textural than dramatic, but it does deepen: from solitary exile to a concrete prophecy, to a rule-binding ritual, to the arrival of the predicted child and the live rewriting of the exile’s terms. The price (bearing exile and memory so the next generation can choose freely) is felt, though the atmosphere remains contemplative rather than sharply suspenseful. For a lyric piece, the tension is coherent and sufficiently sharpened without a big reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be preserved without being hoarded—is signaled early and tightened as the veil widens and the gray city begins to respond. Arin’s main conflict crystallizes when he must choose between trapping wonder in the loom/seed and allowing it to disperse across the gorge; his decision to fling the droplets is a clear, agency-driven escalation with real cost (the loom’s destruction, his own aging, and relinquishing singular guardianship). Internal and external pressures are well braided, though the resistance feels more conceptual than contested, with little sense that he might truly fail or choose wrongly. Still, there is a meaningful narrowing of options and a trade-off, appropriate to the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can untie the fisherman’s silence and thereby free both the spirit and the masks from their oppressive hush—is signaled early and carries through. Pressure escalates texturally as each knot releases more silence and the spirit gains form, with the “last knot” as a clear tightening point. That said, the conflict is quite one-sided: there’s no serious risk of failure or backlash, and the fisherman never resists or complicates the process. The result is deeply atmospheric but emotionally gentle, with limited sense of cost beyond Elian’s internal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will relate to the unknown/silence (to master it via documentation or meet it empathetically)—is clear and coheres. Escalation is subtle but real: she moves from curiosity about the door discrepancy to bodily engagement with the stone, to recognizing the chapel’s opening condition, to renouncing footage in favor of lived, unrecorded experience. Tension is mostly internal and conceptual rather than visceral; the piece never quite sharpens into a hard dilemma with visible external consequences, which slightly softens impact. Still, the final choice forecloses a path (continuing to frame the unknown via machines) in a way that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will cling to objects and data or truly release the dead—is legible early and tightens as the snow globe resists her analytic framing. The meaningful turns are clear: the globe’s suspended plane, Elias’s reframing of “contracts,” the resurfacing of 1914, and her final choice to crack the globe and abandon the notebook. The cost (relinquishing both the relic and her elaborate coping methodology) is on-page and felt, especially in the quiet aftermath and her solitary ascent. The conflict remains primarily internal and lyric, so the sense of jeopardy is emotional rather than situational, but it escalates coherently within that mode.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra can meaningfully articulate unspoken needs before they’re erased—appears early and is maintained. Pressure escalates when the echo accuses her of “encoding us away” and when the graffiti awakens, forcing a choice between containment and release. The cost is felt more as a relinquishing of control and identity (her echo dissolves, the petals are spent) than as a sharp, painful trade-off, so the tension remains gentle rather than harrowing. Still, there is one clear tightening and a credible internal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—what Lira will do with the captain’s legacy of joy hidden inside anguish—is set up early and tightens as she moves from decoding, to discovery of the map, to the choice to descend instead of report. Escalation is more accumulative than dramatic, but there is a real deepening once she understands the captain’s “wager” and must decide whether to continue his project, which she does at personal risk (quietly defying class expectations and house hierarchy). External conflict is low-key; no direct opposition appears, so tension relies on interior and situational stakes, which largely works but keeps this just under the very top band. The brief beats with the duke’s son and stoker nicely show how embracing joy already begins to change her social world, adding a sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving/emitting the sky’s emotional record before the last cable fails—is clear early and escalates through the progressive snapping of strands and the accelerating release of memory kites. Internal and external pressures interweave: Mara must finish the work (and her own recording) under a literal time/structural limit. Her final choice to step out after sealing the telescope is a credible, costly resolution of that pressure. The piece remains more contemplative than confrontational, so the escalation is strong but not razor-edged in terms of visible trade-offs among competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—complete the sky-encoding mural before demolition and reconcile her limitation with her calling—are clear early. Pressure escalates through the physical shudders of placed charges and the three-siren countdown, which compresses her time and forces her to prioritize final strokes and the coin’s return over lingering. Internal and external stakes interweave: she discovers she’s painting her own “face” precisely as her last physical refuge is about to vanish. The main weakness is that tension remains more contemplative than visceral; she never seriously considers not finishing or not leaving, so options feel narrowed but not agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—ship slipping into ghosthood and Lira remaining socially peripheral—are clearly signaled and cohere through to the end. Pressure escalates as the lights dim to near-failure and she “sensed the airship’s heart faltering,” forcing her to act on her odd discovery. However, once she reaches the engine galley, the chief immediately validates the story-fuel premise and her ritual works without resistance or meaningful sacrifice, so the climax feels slightly under-contested. The result is satisfying but a bit safe, with little sense of trade-off or lingering jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the prophetic door to gain the true “rhythm of repair” and resolve his mentor’s eclipse-linked death—is signaled early and tightened effectively by the failed hum test and mocking mirror-sequence. Pressure escalates with the recognition that the mirrors show better drafts, forcing him to confront his own flawed key and, symbolically, his failed moment with his mentor. The irreversible decision to walk through the workshop door, knowing it locks behind him, provides a clear cost and earned resolution. The conflict is primarily internal, and while it’s well-handled, a slightly sharper on-page sense of risk in the key-repair moment would increase tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes (losing the orchards that feed everyone and thus the colony’s survival) are well established, and the external conflict (save the arches before the eclipse) meshes nicely with the internal one (can the living trust and follow a ghost). Pressure escalates via the successive dawn messages, the growing mobilization, Mara’s experimentation with how to help, and the culminating chain across the floating rocks. However, the harvest proceeds with relatively little on-page resistance—no real mishap or near-failure tests their commitment—so the cost feels more thematic than visceral. This keeps the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can and will halt or reverse doomsday by sacrificing herself—is clear and escalates as the pane “pulses,” the lullaby recurses, and the gearwork/organism of the clock is revealed. Her agency drives the key turns: choosing to begin the lullaby, to loop it through lifetimes, and finally to accept staying as the pane’s backing. The cost is unmistakable: she forfeits all other lifelines for an eternal, eroding vigil. Tension is more atmospheric than combative, but it tightens effectively in this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The primary stake—get the travelers out before frost or they die—is clearly signaled and escalated through the birds’ patrol, the seven-lie junction, and the visible onset of frost. Mara’s agency drives the turns: using her weight-impressions, then escalating to the nut’s blueprint and glowing handprint at the final fork. External pressure (time, birds, curse) and internal pressure (reluctant duty, hatred of orchard) are coherently braided, even if the inner moral calculus remains mostly subtextual. The cost is legible: each rescue deepens her own ongoing imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Mara can transform her grief and guilt into a meaningful, shared connection—is legible from the outset and does intensify as she moves from private relic to public installation. The key tightening comes when she decides not just to preserve her sister’s laugh for herself but to leave all the chrysalises in the ravine, relinquishing possession. Conflict is largely internal and contemplative; there is little in the way of external opposition or reversals. For an elite venue, one more concrete obstacle or cost-bearing choice in the lab or during installation could sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative lens, pressure escalates: small transactions with the boy and librarian lead to architectural instability, patrons flooding in, and finally the library growing too heavy with unearned narratives. The dominant stake—what happens when you monetize beginnings by subtracting memory/absence—tightens as the orchard literally sags and the floor dips. Her last act of drinking the moonlight and becoming the door forecloses her prior role with a visible conceptual cost. Because conflict operates more as idea-pressure than as a sharply focused, emotionally fraught dilemma, escalation is strong but not quite searing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marisol can interact with this reservoir of grief without being annihilated or repeating her old “sandpapering” pattern—is clear and escalates as she moves from surface traces to the overwhelming coral memories. The pressure peak arrives when the oceanic remorse nearly drowns her and she chooses to reverse the flow of her gift, which is a credible, character-driven turn. The cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, but we do feel a before/after in how her gift functions and how the fortress’s sorrow is held. Stakes remain mostly internal and metaphysical, which limits visceral tension but suits the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stake—restore the conversation between tower and elevator before dawn so farmers are not stranded—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates modestly through the elevator’s ultimatum (“Build me a bridge, librarian, or let me rot”) and Mireya’s decision to perform a taxing linguistic vigil. However, she meets little real obstacle; her methods work on first attempt, and there is no genuine risk that she will fail or pay a sharper price than fatigue. The conflict thus feels beautiful and thematically rich but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—harvesting entangled dreams at the risk of her body and mind—is clear early, with the milliradian warning explicitly framing death or motor overwrite as the price of error. Pressure escalates through the activation of the helmet into the overwhelming multi-consciousness experience, then tightens again when the moon shifts and she loses control. Her agency drives every turn: she designs the device, initiates the attempt, and chooses to abort and tear it off despite the cost. The failure feels substantial, though the external consequences are slightly abstracted (no lasting injury beyond blood and a single spent mirror), keeping this just shy of brutal.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are legible early (the Archive’s fading memory, lethal kernels, time-limited inversion) and pressure escalates through the kernel passage, the awakening seeds, and the ticking clock. Ilyra makes real tactical adjustments (spectral bands, voice modulation, trusting indigo over ground) that narrow her options. The primary visible cost is the doodle’s sacrifice and the risk she runs, rather than any concrete loss or deep internal price. That keeps the conflict strong but not quite at “devastating” intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—will Ilay succeed in coaxing living music from a long-silent world—is clear and tightened by the methodical sequence from analysis to experimental strumming to the statue’s first breathy response. The escalation is primarily tonal and textural: each strum changes the grove’s response, culminating in the statue’s voice and the insulator’s stored anthem. Agency is strong (she chooses how to “tune” her playing to each crack), but external counterpressure is mild: failure would mean only continued silence, not active harm. The result is a beautifully executed low-key conflict whose subtle cost lands but doesn’t fully maximize possible tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is his need to reframe exile and find a new way to teach, signaled early and carried through. Pressure accumulates internally as he “correlates the silence” and realizes he may have one last, larger-scale student to teach, which provides a modest tightening. However, there is little in the way of on-page resistance, reversal, or narrowed options—no alternative path he seriously considers, no concrete risk to acting or failing to act. The result is that the final decision feels conceptually significant but dramatically low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mirelle can transmute inherited war trauma into a non-lethal, empathetic form of silence before the fireworks erupt—is clear and escalates via each tuned frequency. Pressure tightens as she nears the dial’s end and the fireworks begin, forcing her to accelerate the search for forgiveness. The cost is largely internal (tears, reinterpreting the clasp, surrendering it to the world), but it is legible and thematically scaled. Conflict remains mostly interior and lyric rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Conflict is predominantly internal and textural rather than confrontational: the pressure is to time her actions to the tide’s “thought” and the forest pulse without triggering ruinous rot or attention. The central tightening occurs at the graft: she must balance decay and secrecy (“rot just enough to fuse, yet not so much that its stench alerted night-flying pollinators who would devour it”), which sharpens her earlier, more abstract stake. This is resolved not by external threat but by her internal repositioning of ambition into gratitude and offering, a quieter but coherent Earned Stasis. The piece could push stakes slightly harder—there’s little sense of risk beyond craft failure and spiritual misalignment—but within an accumulative lyric frame it still holds.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—will she truly discover the source of resilience and what it demands of her—is clear and does escalate as she moves from distant observation to direct participation (touching the arrow, seeding the sapling with her own memories). However, external jeopardy and the possibility of failure or harm are underplayed; the inversion and Silent Core feel wondrous more than dangerous. The key tightening is her decision to insert the arrow and then to let the sapling take her memories, which does foreclose a path but reads as almost entirely positive. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle for such a high-concept event.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding what broke the port so she can prevent the next catastrophe—is clear and present from the opening. Pressure escalates via increasingly uncanny environmental responses (hum of the glass, predictive recorder, haze and halos) until the realization that the port stores and releases sound as foresight, after which she must decide how to act on that knowledge. The conflict is primarily situational and conceptual rather than adversarial; there’s little resistance or risk of failure once she reaches the plaza, so the cost feels more like solemn acceptance than hard trade-off. A sharper moment of jeopardy or a heavier personal price would deepen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—securing and embodying wonder before the Council can outlaw it—is intriguing, and there is a discernible tightening as Elian moves from rumor to contact with the Vein to stepping into the sculpted hush and finally swallowing the sheet. However, each obstacle yields relatively easily once introduced, with little sense that he might refuse, fail, or be broken by the process; the Echoless Vein and slab tests feel more like ritual stations than true pressure points. As a result, escalation is present but relatively gentle, more meditative than genuinely coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen will repeat, repair, or compound her past rupture—is legible early via the failed council performance and the ash-scarred fields. Pressure coheres as she draws in the canyon’s silence, the seam opens, and the mirror self in the Barren offers a conceptual challenge that forces her to choose between stepping through or relinquishing the tool. Escalation is more internal than external but still sharp: her desire to understand is tested against the risk of worsening a live, growing failure. The renunciation forecloses a potent path (inter-world travel and power) with visible personal and cosmological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Quince will preserve his composite, borrowed self and the gathered stars, or sacrifice them to restore the sky and reclaim a fragile individuality—is legible early and tightens steadily. Pressure escalates via each “upgrade” in perception (widow → astronomer → halo child) until the core trade-off is unavoidable at the press. The cost of his choice is explicit: he loses every internal voice and becomes terrifyingly blank, while the world regains its stars. One could argue for a slightly sharper articulation of what he personally fears losing before the climax, but the implicit loss of the lattice of self reads clearly in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stakes are internal and thematic: will Elias remain a routine courier in a certainty-hungry world or accept becoming myth. Pressure does escalate via the pendant’s intensifying vibration and the stranger’s revelations, culminating in the pendant dissolving and Elias walking into his “new nature.” However, much of the turning is done to him—via fate and exposition—rather than arising from a hard, dramatized choice with palpable risk or alternative. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle and abstract, limiting the sense of true sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can reconfigure his relationship to grief through this ritual—is clear and sharpened by the lies he must tell. Escalation is subtle but real: from initial contact to vision of her death, to the second, riskier lie, to the admission “I need you still” that cracks the hush and breaks the stasis. The cost is emotional rather than situational, but it’s concretized by the prism’s fracture and his decision to leave it behind. The pressure is mostly internal and atmospheric; readers wanting a sharper external pinch point might feel it almost too controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to sacrifice her voice to send a message across an impossible distance—is clear and escalates organically from unease to irrevocable choice. The tightening is strong when she realizes the bead must complete the puzzle and that her voice is the required price. The cost is unmistakable (permanent muteness, transformed relationship to the orchard and to herself), and the later seasons show the enduring consequence. What keeps this below the very top band is that the positive pole of the trade (what/who the message is for) stays somewhat conceptual, muting moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Thistle can reclaim purpose and reshape a stagnant world into something resilient—is clear but faces little on-page resistance. Villagers’ confusion is mentioned but never escalates into active obstruction, danger, or meaningful alternative; the work proceeds without setback, and success feels foreordained once the pattern is clear. The seventh night and singing arches add a sense of culmination, but there is no true reversal or narrowing of options that tests Thistle’s resolve. The result is lyrically compelling but low-tension, limiting the sense of cost and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—unearthing the withheld truth about her lover and what her gift has enabled—is clear and escalates from abstract itch to existential reckoning. Pressure deepens as each bay reveals more personal consequence, culminating in the locker and data cube, then spikes again when she realizes her complicity. Her final decision to weaponize her maps against secrecy rather than for militaries reads as an earned renunciation with cost: she can no longer be innocent or comfortably complicit. The conflict remains largely internal, but internal and external pressures are well braided.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are modest but clear: keep the chain unbroken, protect the tower from forgetting, and confirm the keeper’s continued presence. Pressure escalates when the lamp dies early and he fears she has stepped over the rail, sharpening his actions with a grief-tinged urgency. His responses—adding the fourth stone, bottling the glass, building the apology cairn, and rowing backward to keep the tower in sight—constitute an earned endurance choice with emotional cost. The only slight limitation is that the external stakes never move beyond the contemplative and symbolic, even within this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirael will accept and actively shape a new dawn at the cost of stars, the lighthouse, and her prior role—is present and escalates through each prophetic laugh. There is a clear tightening when she realizes each laugh erases a star and when she must steer into “the blank page,” foreclosing the option of mere maintenance of the old order. However, the conflict is largely one-sided; external resistance is absent and internal hesitation is brief, so the journey reads more as inevitable unfolding than contested struggle. The cost is real but processed mainly at a conceptual level.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Hoshiko will relate to stories and the donor heart—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when she realizes the collector misunderstood the woman and when she chooses a new purpose. However, pressure never tightens beyond contemplative inquiry; there’s no real threat, loss, or dilemma that forces painful trade-offs, so escalation remains gentle. The decision at the end is resonant but low-friction, limiting the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and relieving quantified sorrow, especially in relation to trees—is coherent and present early. Pressure does deepen with the pin’s echo of the astronomer’s collapse and the realization of what trees have been forced to witness. However, there’s little real resistance or risk in the process; once Mara begins, the ritual unfolds smoothly without serious doubt, cost-testing, or threatened failure. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-tension progression.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm through recovered, communal song—is clear early and tightens meaningfully when the song falters for lack of chorus and when the night retaliates via tarry vines. The keeper’s self-wounding to reclaim her name and forge a new lens is an effective deepening and cost, and the revised song that enjoins mirrors to sing each other’s verses is a genuine strategic shift rather than a cosmetic change. Still, obstacles tend to yield once she adjusts, with no serious failure or loss beyond the single wound; the night’s resistance feels brief relative to the declared world-scale stakes. The conflict works, but doesn’t quite reach the level of punishing inevitability seen in the strongest pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her catastrophic mistake into sustaining wisdom under threat of death—is clear from early on and sharpened by the midnight purge. Pressure escalates from quiet hiding to the chandeliers’ shift and Vale’s approach, forcing a high-cost decision. Her agency at the climax (choosing to pour her presence into the invitation instead of fleeing) forecloses her human future in a way that feels proportionate to the guilt established. The conflict is primarily internal but remains taut because the external purge and Vale’s sensing ability keep the threat concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—resisting the city’s slide into amnesiac normality and finding a non-destructive way to handle the miraculous loaf—is clear and tight. Escalation is gentle but real: from discovery and potential misuse of the bread to a citywide guerrilla pattern, then to visible spatial and artistic “uncloaking,” culminating in the risk of ordinary life reabsorbing the miracle (normal bread returning) and her choosing to read that as revelation instead of loss. The cost is largely emotional and conceptual—her tears at ordinary bread, acceptance that sacredness was never missing—but that cost is legible. The conflict could benefit from one more concrete, resisting force (social, institutional, or magical) testing her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether any human virtues/vows still meaningfully “resonate” against oblivion—is clear and tightened by the dwindling lantern fuel and the progressive failure of each vow. Escalation is accumulative: each measurement worsens the situation, culminating in the physical shattering of the lantern and the total loss of the original medium. Her choice to hurry measurements and then seed the tree with data is a credible, costly adaptation rather than a soft fade-out. The conflict is mostly conceptual/internal but remains tangible via tools, time, and physical consequences (cold, blood, broken glass).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—whether she will betray her father’s promise by trading the fob to capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and threads coherently through the night. Escalation comes from her rehearsed fantasies of being thwarted versus the reality of his absence, with the rising tide and approaching dawn narrowing her emotional options. The final act of opening her fist and letting the mermaid drop is an earned, costly renunciation that forecloses the hope that he cares enough to intervene. The conflict remains primarily internal; some readers might want one small external complication beyond her imagined scenarios to further sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she will cling to skepticism or accept her identity as a weather-bearer—and it is signaled early via her investigative motive. Pressure escalates when the ring pulls her to the woman and their climates begin to merge, culminating in the branding and acceptance. However, her resistance dissolves with minimal real struggle; there’s little sense of what she tangibly risks by letting go of skepticism beyond a generalized shift in worldview. The conflict is effective but relatively gentle, lacking a sharper trade-off or harder choice that might elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain trapped by her mnemonic gift and her mother’s erasure or repurpose that calling—is clear and consistently pressured by the cave’s demands and the parchment’s discovery. Escalation tracks well: from hiding, to compelled restoration, to magic intensifying (crystal growth, lock warming, mother’s laughter), to her aboveground choice to stop selling faces and invite others into creation. The cost is emotional and vocational rather than physical but is legible: she abandons a known survival strategy and embraces a more vulnerable, uncertain practice. What’s missing for the very top band is a slightly sharper on-page articulation of what she risks materially by yielding to the collaboration in the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Aurelia’s fear of emotional suffocation and the larger question of whether honest language can still matter in a dying environment—are clear and escalate via the map’s mystery and the risk of breaking curfew. The key tightening comes when she discovers the cathedral of undelivered letters and chooses to add her own confession, then stay with Corin to voice them, which forecloses a path of isolation. However, external danger (toxic air, rationing) stays largely notional, so the felt cost centers on intimacy and vocation rather than tangible peril. This keeps the pressure from fully peaking at the level the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—tuning the sculpture in time for the comet so wonder’s “frequency” can be preserved—is signaled early and steadily tightened. Escalation comes through preparation pressure (final calibration against a fixed celestial deadline) rather than confrontation, with the comet’s arrival serving as the primary intensification. Her agency is quiet but real: choosing how to tune, when to stop, and then to walk away and transfer a wedge to the boy instead of clinging to her creation. The cost is subtle yet legible: she relinquishes ownership and centrality, trusting an uncontrollable future.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether K-17 will enforce sterile order or allow disruptive, non-miniaturizable childhood fears to transform it and the farm—is clear and escalates. Pressure tightens as the magnetic shift nears completion and the box grows heavier and more intrusive, forcing a stance at the burn’s arrival. The cost (surrendering its prior self to become the farm’s memory-core) is legible but plays more as an inevitable acceptance than a sharply contested choice. Slightly more dramatized resistance or alternative options on the page would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the mailbox’s mystery and the community’s accumulated grief—is clear and coherently pressured from first rumor to communal vigil. Escalation is accumulative: the heartbeat discovery, the failed visual inspection, and the shared night of listening steadily narrow Mira’s options from “solve” toward “witness.” Her final choice to forego opening in favor of creating a ritual space marks a real foreclosure of a path. The piece falls just short of higher-band conflict because the moment of renunciation is quiet and largely uncontested, with limited sense of a live alternative pressing back at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recover and embody the data seed before the lab fails, to prevent its weaponization and liberate vulnerability—is clear and coherent. There is one main escalation: the dice dictate entry into the dangerous shaft leading to the archive, and the choice to swallow the page rather than preserve it externally. However, all tactical turns succeed smoothly; there’s no real resistance or reversal beyond implied danger and a ticking clock, so tension is more aesthetic than gut-level. The resolution is earned, but the price and narrowing of options could be sharpened to raise this into a more truly pressured climax.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering her sister’s erased memories—is clearly signaled and remains coherent throughout. Escalation is quiet but real: from uneasy observation of the carcass to descending into the chamber, to the gravity collapse and the intense, almost overwhelming emergence/dispersal of memories. The key tightening is the gravity pockets collapsing into a point and then dissolving, foreclosing the possibility of containing or selectively curating what returns; Miren must accept loss and diffusion. Pressure stays mostly internal and situational rather than driven by antagonistic forces, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier but still strong for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—hushing a dangerous prophecy infiltrating dreams—is established early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates when the prophecy actively “fights back” via cricket-encoded drumbeats, forcing him deeper into ritual and culminating in the risky internalization of the hush sphere. The cost is conceptually clear but the struggle itself feels slightly too smooth; he never seems in serious danger of failing or doubting his path. That small softness in felt jeopardy keeps the escalation strong rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The primary pressure is situational/accumulative: the intensifying meteor shower and the building’s confessed exhaustion force a choice about who will carry its memory. The interrogation of the gargoyle and the tutor’s timed revelation escalate the abstract stakes (companionship vs. stewardship vs. erasure), culminating in the narrator accepting the seal and new role. The cost is conceptually clear—taking on the burden of others’ loneliness and the building’s history, losing the tutor—but the internal struggle around that acceptance is underplayed; the narrator yields almost seamlessly. As a result, escalation feels profound but slightly more ceremonial than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—recovering and reauthorizing a forbidden memory—is clear early and tightens meaningfully as Mara chooses to perform a costly ritual rather than accept erasure. Pressure escalates from internal unease to an irreversible bargain: each syllable of song trades away color, culminating in permanent grayscale vision. Her choice to leave the garden open to others, and to discard the shell, forecloses the safer path of remaining uniquely special or hidden. The conflict remains largely internal and situational, but the trade-off is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain chained to vengeance/guilt or move toward self-forgiveness—is legible early and tightens as she escalates from contemplation to self-wounding and blood-writing. Internal and external stakes (personal soul vs. toppled regimes, dead sister) are braided, with the key turn being her decision to write in her own hand and relinquish the thorn. Pressure is primarily interior and accumulative rather than driven by new obstacles, so tension remains somewhat static in texture, but the emotional cost of her choice is clear. A bit more friction (self-doubt, temptation to keep the thorn) at the climax would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—will Lira remain an involuntary echo like her mother or achieve a finished, traveling life—is signaled early and tightened steadily as the canyon’s voices constrict her (“tightened around her lungs until she sang to survive”). Pressure escalates through the descent, the revelation of her mother’s cocoon, and the necessity of performing a risky, finalizing farewell. The cost is real but primarily emotional and existential; there’s little sense that the ritual might fail or backfire beyond implication. That keeps the conflict strong but not maximally sharp for a “prestige” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—salvaging something pure before the glacier digests the passengers—is clear, and there is one solid tightening when the glacier cracks the shrine to reveal the corridor, followed by the sealing “windows of connection” as she leaves. However, resistance is minimal: the glacier accedes after a single silent negotiation, and Marrow encounters little genuine risk or failure on the way to the core. Internal stakes (risk of being overwhelmed by others’ memories) are suggested but never forced to a sharp choice. As a result, tension feels more eerie than urgent, effective but not maximally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether invisible effort has meaning and reach—is clear, with a concrete proxy in finding the lost whisk. Escalation is internal and textural: from quiet mourning of the “invisible labor inside it” to discovering the inscription and witnessing how her lullaby alters the oarsman’s course. The cost is a recommitment to endless, unseen mending rather than some more obviously glorious path. The conflict never sharpens into direct opposition, so tension remains gentle, but for a lyric piece it still deepens satisfactorily.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marisol will recover and weaponize the truth at personal cost—is signaled early and tightened as she enters the stillpoint, reconstructs the letters, and endures the diamond’s playback. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than action-based, but it works: the curse reframes from superstition to unbearable perfect memory, and the choice to keep or relinquish that burden provides a real hinge. Her agency drives the key turns (finding the stillpoint by resonance, choosing to hang the diamond, deciding to seed/bury the letters). What keeps this below the very top tier is that external opposition is minimal and the internal conflict, while present, isn’t explored through multiple pressured reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will trigger a world-shaping broadcast and in doing so relinquish her current self—is clear early and tightens as the transmission reveals coordinates and then a physical doorway. The late prophetic lyric, sung in her own aged voice, is an effective escalation that reframes the choice as becoming the “darkness others flee,” not just a grand savior. Her final action forecloses the option of remaining an isolated watcher, embracing the cost. If anything, the external stakes stay abstract (no concrete glimpse of harm/benefit below) but the internal/moral stakes carry the load well.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Posy meaningfully redeem and transmit the past before it vanishes—emerges early and is gently tightened by the child’s request and her decision to finally open and use the box. The major pressure point is that choice to risk the jars’ contents in a device that has so far “refused to release” anything. However, opposition is diffuse; there’s no strong counter-force beyond abstract loss and a faint suggestion of hunger vs. toll. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth swell than a tested, costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the Echo’s protection without destroying Port Viburnum—is signaled early and escalates coherently as the artifact worsens, shadows gain form, and the ice starts to break. The central moral/strategic pinch (“if she saved the artifact, the marina would shatter… if she let the bone disintegrate…”) is clear and strong. Her agency in inventing a third path through altered bowing and inviting shadows to listen is compelling, but the resolution feels almost frictionless: the third option succeeds without any visible loss beyond the key’s wear and her exhaustion. That slight ease at the climax keeps the pressure just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—timing a systemic disruption so the coast can break from the capital—appears early and tightens via the three-midnight tremor, the skewed moon path, and the viaduct’s hum deepening into a “pulse.” Escalation here is accumulative rather than reversalist, but the cadence shift at the spiral’s revelation and the field’s imminent buckling clearly narrows his options to a single, irrevocable act. Internal and external pressures are intertwined: his impatience is tested most acutely when he must still himself at the very moment of maximum energy. Because consequences for characters beyond him are mostly offstage, the stakes feel a touch abstracted from visceral harm, which is the only notable limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Mara confronting institutional and personal complicity and deciding whether to bury or expose the truth; that’s signaled and followed through. Pressure escalates primarily via knowledge: first the suicides’ pattern, then the tally marks, then the journal, then the revelation about her father. The final turn—choosing to “file her report” truthfully—is an internal resolution that forecloses the easier path of silence. Because there is little active opposition on the page (no living antagonist, no direct threat), tension feels more contemplative than urgent, which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear early—Rowan’s impending execution and his final request—giving immediate weight to Emil’s actions. There is a meaningful internal escalation when Emil shifts from private contrition to concrete risk (sending the evidence, diverting chapel funds), which redefines his role from passive witness to fragile activist. However, resistance in the scene is relatively gentle: Olya’s reluctance is brief, and no substantial obstacle tests Emil’s resolve beyond his own conscience, which keeps the tension from reaching truly knifelike intensity. The moral calculus is sharp, but the on-page struggle feels a bit too smooth for the gravity of the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding and “ringing the bell no one hears yet”—is clear and escalates when the Algorithm shifts from wandering search to the imperative “Descend” and the dangerous near-contact with the acid sea. The missing clapper provides a satisfying complication that forces her to improvise with the arrow tip and kaleidoscope alignment. However, opposition is largely situational and philosophical; there is little on-page resistance beyond environmental risk and no moment where Juniper seriously considers abandonment. The pressure deepens once, effectively, but never feels truly constricting or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—truth and justice for the missing versus the keeper’s own continued existence in the archive—is signaled early and tightens through each step of investigation. The bargain at Block 73 is a clear escalation where she must trade her identity and livelihood to expose the Aurora truth, and the cost is on the page as her employee file flickers out. Internal and external conflicts align: loyalty to role vs loyalty to the erased, private grief vs public disclosure. The only constraint is that external resistance (from corporate or security) is minimal, so most pressure is internal rather than combative.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stakes—preventing the border from thinning into void and breaking the cycle of apathy—are signaled early and tightened as Mara chooses to sacrifice her training and confront the Keeper. Escalation is clean: investigation in the orchard → entering the harbor → self-endangering empathy ingestion → revocation phrase that detonates the emotional market. The cost is legible: she floods herself with everything she’s suppressed and permanently alters the keeper protocol, foreclosing the old, “safe” detachment. A touch more visceral struggle (psychic or physical) after swallowing empathy could further sharpen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Mara will stand in relation to death and endings—is signaled early and meaningfully tightens when the boy runs toward the mercy ship, crystallizing a live choice: let him board for a sanctioned ending or intervene. Her agency at the gangway (following him, using the parasol to create a counter-note, then choosing trawling and tea over recording last words) drives the main turn. The later-life dispatcher role and the parasol remaining in the ice deepen rather than reset the conflict, showing an enduring commitment to a new ethic of “staying usable.” Still, tension remains predominantly contemplative; the piece never quite presses the situation into a truly painful trade-off on the page, which holds escalation just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept “we are impossible” or reclaim possibility—emerges clearly and tightens as he moves from passive watching to active planning (regrafting, writing, going to the station). Internal conflict does escalate via the tactile encounter with the burned letter and the “ghost heat” realization that the mismatch lay in the prophecy, not the lovers. However, pressure remains mostly reflective and gentle; we don’t feel a sharp test or moment where he nearly chooses stasis, so the cost is more implied than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing wisdom’s echo from fading—is signaled early and the ritual gives the walker clear agency. However, escalation is gentle: once the clearing appears, success feels almost inevitable, and no concrete obstacle or near-failure sharpens the cost. Internal conflict (avoiding desperation, fear of repeating past failure) is present but not truly tested in scene. The result is conceptually tense but emotionally low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether pain can be transmuted into a communal masterpiece—is clear, but on-page pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested. There is a textural escalation as she moves from opening the case to forming the spiral dove and then sharing it with descendants, yet there’s no real risk that the ritual will fail or be rejected. The “tightening” is more a crescendo of imagery than a narrowing of options or heightening of cost. As a result, the ending feels lovely and apt but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning and “growth” can persist after language’s formal end—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains very gentle. Escalation exists in a textural way (increasingly varied sequences, crystal warming, the library’s literal response with the falling book) yet Elara never faces a hard dilemma or visible sacrifice beyond choosing to witness and then to leave. The internal and external conflicts are aligned but rarely bite against each other. The quiet mode works, but at a high-literary bar the tension could carry a sharper sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding and capturing the sound of growing older before his own memory erases the attempt—is clear, and tension accumulates as he follows self-laid markers into the fog toward the recorder. The discovery and playing of the childhood tape provide a genuine deepening of pressure and a narrowing of focus. Still, escalation remains mostly internal and textural without a sharp on-page trade-off or reversal; he endures rather than actively choosing between competing costs, which keeps the conflict effective but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will cling to her “changelessly constant” orbit or allow the shaking foundations to force her own restructuring—is clear and escalates through the mounting tremors and the spinning hand’s pressure. The decisive tightening comes when she loads the clock hand into the Hasselblad and points it inward, committing to capture—and thereby end—the observatory’s futures. The external collapse and internal renunciation interweave well, with real loss (her life’s work, identity as caretaker) felt on the page. The piece leans more on inevitability and pattern than on sharply contested reversals, which keeps tension strong but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Mara delivering a meaningful, “flawless” goodbye under the inevitability of death—is clear and tightens as she moves from hymning the mundane to hymning the scent of hope, then to confronting her own grief. Conflict is primarily situational/accumulative rather than combative, but the pressure still escalates: Calderon’s slowing vitals, the monitor flattening, then the emotional handoff to the daughter and Mara’s private reckoning. The cost is emotional endurance and carrying unresolved fragments rather than a sharp decision between competing external options, which keeps this just shy of the very highest scores for stakes clarity. Still, the escalation under a quiet lens is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restore or comprehend vanished shadows, with an implied world-scale cost—is established early and sharpened by the image of shadows slipping like silk scarves. Pressure escalates effectively through the activation of the automaton, the disturbing sight of her detached shadow, and the requirement to “walk the circumference of the twist,” culminating in her choice to seal the awakening and accept a personal loss. The conflict is mostly situational and metaphysical rather than interpersonal, but Lyra’s agency clearly drives every major turn. The risk and price are conceptually strong, though the emotional struggle around the final trade is somewhat compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to live with a catastrophic yet generative error—is clear early and tightens as Elara moves from passive rumination on the bench to active engagement with the garden and changeling. The key deepening occurs when the lie’s benefits (the winter survived, the blacksmith’s wife’s transformed grief) are juxtaposed with the boy’s burial, sharpening the ethical dilemma. Her choice to “set” mistakes like bones and resume her healer role under a new philosophy is an earned response, foreclosing the path of retreating into skepticism or denial. Stakes are primarily internal/moral but feel consequential for the community as sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can Lira transform dangerous light into a form that will not provoke the villagers’ fear, and at what personal cost. Pressure escalates via the ritual’s increasing responsiveness (mist lifting the shard, the seawater drop, the pearl’s formation) and culminates in the weighing and dissolution of the pearl. Her agency—performing the polishing, lifting and weighing the pearl, then letting it dissolve—is responsible for the single major turn and its cost. The main limitation, for a top-tier venue, is the relative softness of overt resistance; conflict stays almost entirely internal and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary stake—how Mira chooses to relate to her trauma and its virality—tightens meaningfully when Elias offers a new recording, forcing her to decide what kind of telling she can live with. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than combative, but the pressure of 53 million views and the looming, unheard first confession is present. Escalation is quiet but real: from solitary retreat to shared witnessing to the costly choice to bury the second voice instead of broadcasting it. The stakes stay scaled to the length and mode, though a slightly clearer sense of what she gives up in material terms could sharpen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will finish her novel and honor her abandoned characters/“hopes”—is established early and tightened through each apparition, especially Lira’s accusation. Internal conflict escalates convincingly, but external pressures (lost advance, landlord) stay mostly off-page, serving more as atmospheric stakes than as active antagonists. The core turn is strong: she chooses to offer the weighted shell back and accept being rewritten, a clear narrowing of options with emotional cost. The resolution feels a shade “easy” in that courage flows from the nexus without much on-page resistance at the final beat, which slightly softens the sense of hard-won price.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (curing the forgetting sickness / restoring cultural continuity) is clear early, and the time-locked ritual provides a solid structural pressure that tightens toward the moonset. Elara’s choices—to begin singing, to shift to the final sequence, to release pollen at the liminal instant—drive escalation, and internal and external stakes are well braided. Yet the conflict’s feel is mostly ceremonial rather than embattled: nothing meaningfully resists her, and no option is dramatically foreclosed on the page. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than viscerally high, keeping the conflict band strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can turn heartbeat into a map back to his lover without destroying himself—is clear and centered early. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary searching to the high-risk sealing (sound could ignite the flash-paper) to the orchard’s awakening and the realization that translation requires permanent stillness. The choice to remain is a genuine renunciation that narrows his options and carries emotional cost. The conflict is mostly internal and lyrical, so while it’s coherent and deepens, it never feels sharply knife-edged in the way a top-tier escalation might.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring coherent time to the village without annihilating the mystery—is legible and resolved. Pressure escalates through deepening understanding rather than overt obstacles: discovering the metal scalloped by sound, realizing the mechanism harvested voices, then choosing to feed it silence and seal it. The emotional or practical risk feels relatively low-key; nothing actively resists Ansel, so the tension is more contemplative than urgent. Still, his final renunciation (key never duplicated) provides a meaningful narrowing of options and a discernible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the valley from folding in on itself by completing the weave—is established early and deepened when failure is concretized as being “locking her inside an eternal now.” Escalation is clear: initial ritual work, then the grotto’s resistance and suffocating silence, then the imminent loss of the flame, all culminating in the forced confession. The choice to add her own heaviest burden is a genuine trade-off with visible cost (blood, pain, and emotional exposure). If anything, the external valley-stake remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, but the internal cost lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to live with Emil’s death and that last performance—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates texturally as carving shifts from abstract containment to explicitly retracing the line of his body blocking the lion and confronting the blood-soaked sawdust. The key tightening is her decision to transform the residue of that night (shavings, latch, commands) into curated artifacts rather than mementos of trauma, foreclosing pure denial. It’s a quiet internal conflict with no sharp reversals, but the earned stasis at the end still carries real, legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can renegotiate his relationship to past ambition and regret via his younger ghost—is clearly posed and tightened. Pressure escalates with each use of the wheel (summoning, accusation, then the radical act of breaking it to release unrealized choices), culminating in the lagoon freezing and forcing a stance: “shared erosion” rather than control. The cost is the relinquishment of fantasy redos (the undeveloped squares dissolve) and the acceptance that the ghost remains behind, which forecloses a path. The conflict stays mostly internal and philosophical, but it is consistently dramatized in concrete, escalating beats rather than left as static musing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Alya can coax a dead terminal into a living system of hope—is clear and consistently pursued. Pressure does escalate in a textural way as more systems awaken (birds, drone, fountain) and the implications of her meddling expand from small sculpture to a whole complex. However, opposition is mostly inert (time, rust, abandonment) and rarely pushes back in a way that forces hard trade-offs or genuine risk. The result is a satisfyingly deepening mood rather than a sharply tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—between clinging to an impossible, misunderstood ambition and surrendering it—is clear and culminates in a concrete choice to leave the clock behind. Escalation is more deepening than tightening, with the pressure accruing through sensory intensity and remembered humiliation rather than strong reversals. His renunciation has a credible cost (abandoning a defining dream, accepting emptiness), but the path to that choice feels relatively foregone once he arrives, so tension is more meditative than gripping. This suits the piece’s mode but keeps stakes from feeling truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—can Mara uncover the true “architecture of lies” around her father and decide what to do with that knowledge—is clear from early on and deepens as she moves from suspicion in the logs to proof in the journals. The major tightening comes with the coordinate revelation that leads to the bunker and the horrific confirmation of betrayal, forcing her into a new, costlier commitment. Internal and external conflicts are well braided, but the lack of serious resistance (Riga agrees readily; the salvage succeeds without complication) slightly flattens escalation. The final choice to broadcast truth city by city is strong, though it reads more as a pivot to a larger war than a fully pressured peak within this slice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the method of storm-corn planting encoded in rope before institutional forces erase it—is clear from early on and narrows as Ari realizes this stanza is the last link after the final weaver’s death. Escalation is modest but coherent: from decoding under time pressure, to the harbormaster’s legal threat, to Ari’s simultaneous concealment, escape, and planting. Her decision to break the bead and plant on the forbidden dock is a meaningful tightening that forecloses compliance and carries implied long-term cost. The external conflict resolves quickly, so tension is more textural and conceptual than pulse-pounding, which slightly limits the felt price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform her compulsion to explain absences into a genuine “geography of healing”—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates as she unspools the thread, moving from individual clients to the realization that she herself is implicated, culminating in the choice to finish the thread and leave the garden. The conflict stays mostly internal and contemplative; there is no sharp external obstacle, which keeps tension at a low simmer rather than a boil. Still, the narrowing of options (continue as obituary-writer vs. relinquish the role) is legible and costs her an identity she’s clung to for seven years.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can he reawaken beauty, and at what price?—is clear and carried through to the end. Escalation exists but is more conceptual than oppositional: he undertakes a single ritual-like attempt that succeeds without serious setback or resistance, and tension comes mainly from anticipation, not thwarted efforts. The cost (beauty refuses the cage, the palace falls) is powerfully rendered at closure and tied to his choice to proceed. Still, the middle lacks a tightening obstacle or failed iteration that might have sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can she transform her inheritance of fire into something restorative without denying its damage—is articulated early and tightened via the ritual’s irreversibility (once she plants and waters the sand, the act stands). Pressure escalates texturally as memories grow more charged (the courtroom echo, the night with the dolphin lighter) and culminates in her internal test: will she stay with the ritual and choose future-facing growth. The final promise to bring saplings is a meaningful narrowing of options that commits her to this path over pure rejection or pure loyalty. The conflict is almost entirely internal and could bear one more concrete, present-tense snag to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will confront and release her family’s and her own abandonment—is clear and escalates as the fountains move from others’ betrayals to her own. The meaningful tightening arrives at the Fountain of Unkept Promises, where the conflict turns inward; the final act of fully opening the box in Forgiveness is an earned resolution. However, the path is mostly obstacle-free; Mara decides, remembers, and releases with little on-page resistance or risk of refusal, which flattens tension. The cost is emotionally implied but never sharply contested in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure—whether Kael will submit to the generational pattern of becoming another luminous bloom or find a different way to share light—is established and deepened, especially through the hairline crack that foreshadows his own “great-loss.” There is a meaningful tightening when the anomalous echo appears and he chooses to step off the established path and interact with the buried beacon, leading directly to the reconfiguration of the pattern. Still, tension remains mostly existential and meditative; there’s little sense that he could fail or pay a harsher price, which keeps the escalation strong but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reshaping collective grief—is clear, and pressure accumulates via increasingly uncanny discoveries culminating in the personal chrysalis. Escalation is more textural than conflictual; the story tightens emotionally but rarely forces the carver into hard, mutually exclusive choices. Her agency is present (choosing to follow, to sit, to feel, to reframe her work), yet the path feels guided more by revelation than by contested decisions. The cost—finally letting herself feel and altering her vocational purpose—is real but presented gently, with limited friction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—duty to maintain the debt-measuring clock versus loyalty to his brother and the land—is crisply articulated and escalates toward a single pressured decision. The pendulum’s pause is a clear tightening of options, and his solution (changing the bob rather than simply stopping the clock) carries a visible cost in labor and risk. Internal and external stakes interlock: villagers’ fear, the ridge’s erosion, and the brother’s ghosted field all converge in this moment. The only limit is that resistance from others remains offstage, so antagonistic pressure is more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—unearthing what the dead intend and what it demands of Mercy—is clear and progresses logically through each discovery, with one meaningful tightening when the map points to her family’s grave. The external conflict is mostly situational and puzzle-based, with no overt antagonist or immediate danger, keeping the pressure thoughtful rather than visceral. The culminating choice to descend and accept the keeper role does foreclose a path, but the emotional and practical stakes of that renunciation could be underlined more sharply on the page. As a result, escalation feels elegant and coherent but somewhat gentle for top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—what future, if any, will be written into the last blank surface before dawn—is legible early and deepens as we see prior failures and her different, more surrender-based tactic. Pressure escalates through her ascent, the quill’s increasing demands, and the memory-for-strokes trade, culminating in her choice to become the constraint rather than an author of a single timeline. The cost is concrete (loss of memories, body, name) and conceptually scaled (relinquishing personal authorship for communal possibility). Tension is more philosophical than visceral, which slightly softens moment-to-moment urgency but fits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—smuggling story back into a censored society without being caught—is clear early and escalates through the discovery of the code, the preparation, and the solstice broadcast under inspection threat. Agency is strong: Mila chooses to weaponize dust, to weave the antennae, to broadcast despite likely discovery, and to stay copying when inspectors burst in. The inspectors’ invasion provides a real tightening, and the cost for them (eyes reflecting burned paragraphs, uniforms shedding ash) is vivid. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page price or real jeopardy for Mila herself beyond thematic risk; she remains almost serenely untouchable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can transform inherited, incomplete stories and grief into an honest installation—is legible early and develops through her decisions about chair placement, mask-wearing, and the powder spiral. Pressure escalates texturally as the ritual deepens, especially once she begins walking the spiral and aligning her eyes with the fatal shard. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no on-page reversal or hard trade-off beyond acceptance, which slightly softens the sense of escalation for a competitive market. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through altered external options.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the city’s story of itself will ossify in denial or be countered—is clear and present early through the painted-over street names. Escalation arrives via her deeper descent into the sewers, the discovery of the egalitarian burial sump, and the act of engraving a counter-narrative, culminating in her public pronouncement. The cost is mostly conceptual and social (risking being labeled mad or dangerous, foreclosing her prior silence) rather than directly visceral, but it’s legible enough for this length and mode. A slightly more immediate on-page threat or pushback from others at the end would intensify the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can reconfigure a hatred-soaked city by recovering/subtracting lost harmonies—is clear and tight for a lyric piece. Pressure escalates through a single coherent deepening: from listening and collecting syllables, to recognizing the missing root tone, to sacrificing her own singing voice and staying through the night to see the change through. The cost is legible (she never sings aloud again; the rosette crumbles; her action quietly reshapes but also permanently alters her relationship to sound). Because conflict is almost entirely internal and ritualized, there’s less sense of risk or potential failure in the moment, which keeps it just shy of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marisol can seed forbidden, collective memory under an oppressive regime—is clear and escalates through the ticking alignment and the Ministry’s looming threat. Her agency drives all meaningful turns, from planting to pruning to feeding blood to the seed. However, opposition never fully bites: the Ministry remains offstage until after the victory, and their arrival is defanged instantly by the greenhouse’s magic, softening perceived risk and price. The tension thus feels more lyrical than pressured, limiting the ceiling here.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in the face of dead systems and rigid routine—is established early and escalates from minor gestures (recalibrating the turnstile) to the major transgression (lying to trigger the tower). The maintenance-stair ascent and the second riddle tighten pressure, forcing Mara to choose between her defining truth-curse and her wonder-preserving ethos. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual but still legible: she violates the core rule of her existence and implicitly risks her role by leaving the gate open and toll waived. Stakes stay slightly abstract rather than viscerally personal (no concrete consequence from the engineers on-page), keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the subtle “heartbeat” of the houses and resolving the arrhythmic unease—is clear and escalates from observation to a focused ritual in the shack. The pressure is gentle rather than urgent; nothing threatens Elara personally, and the village’s harm is conceptual (living absences, unbalanced homes) rather than concretely perilous. Her agency at the compass (choosing to use the displaced fragments and crush the shard, then to leave the compass needle-less) earns the resolution. The lack of a sharper trade-off or more palpable jeopardy keeps the stakes from fully tightening into a high-tension peak.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant conflict—whether to preserve a dead, certain order or risk dissolving it in nuance—is clear and tracks through the story. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual but does tighten as the statue approaches the arch and contemplates institutional hypocrisy and self-implication. The choice to break the ampoule forecloses a path (remaining a passive sentinel of certainty) with real cost, and the reverberation through the city makes that cost concrete. The pressure is strong but relatively quiet; more palpable resistance or risk in the environment could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains defined by endless, regret-driven climbing or reconfigures her relation to the missed opportunity—is clear and escalates as the staircase’s behavior responds to her actions. The key tightening comes when the staircase slows and she must choose between preserving its motion (and thus her identity) or risking obliteration; the later refusal to step through the door heightens this into a costly renunciation. Internal and external conflict are closely braided: her mathematical interventions and blood-marking both test and preserve the very trap she fears. The cost remains mostly conceptual and existential rather than sharply dramatized in physical consequence, which slightly mutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether Mira can turn her insomnia and the haunted brush into a living mural that rescues lost language/kindness from erasure—is clear and does intensify as the brush activates, the air thickens, and the greenhouse becomes a communal lung. The key deepening is the realization that the mural is for lungs, not walls, which reweights the project from private compulsion to public act with social cost/impact. However, pressure remains mostly spiritual and aesthetic; there’s little real risk of failure or harm on the page, so tension never quite sharpens into a difficult, consequential choice. The wind and approaching Jules add texture more than genuine threat, keeping escalation strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether culture will be passively archived into extinction or actively lived—is clear, and it tightens when the thaw removes the expected external savior (the beekeeper). The key turn is relational and internal: the Chen grandmother’s challenge and Mei’s proactive “we realized we couldn’t wait” push Aurelia from spectator to participant, culminating in her taking up dough and repurposing her documentation. Pressure is coherent but remains low-key; there’s no sharp on-page sacrifice beyond identity and method. The conflict lands, but the escalation feels more graceful than urgent, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The primary stake—evading a fixed death at dawn—is clear from early on and escalates as he moves from observation to dangerous experiment (tying in the hunger stone, then committing to the throw). The decisive tightening comes when the yoyo reaches the end of its cord and he is forced to choose among the two visible futures or something riskier, cutting the string to step into the fold. The cost is explicit and non-trivial: survival at the loss of his defining talent. The conflict is intense but essentially single-threaded; there’s little ethical or relational complication, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The core stake—whether she can face and reconfigure her fear/trauma post-resuscitation—is signaled very early via the advisor’s instruction and the return to the collapse site. Pressure coherently increases from atmospheric unease to the cursed booth revelation, then to the literal walk through weaponized reflections, and finally to the confrontation with the gray child who embodies fear. Her choice to give up both the paradoxical note and the clasp, effectively disarming herself and dismissing the advisor, forecloses the path of being guided by fear and near-death obsession. While the conflict is largely internal and contemplative, the escalation and price are clear and proportionate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—crossing the Doldrum Wall—is clear, and the confrontation with total calm is a satisfying tightening after the prophetic cloud-reading. The escalation from solo nightly experimentation to collective drumming and engineered spiral crown reads as a genuine deepening of tactics. However, danger and potential loss remain abstract; there is no concrete on-page threat (starvation, madness, external hazard) to make the cost of failure felt. As a result, the conflict is intellectually engaging but emotionally low-pressure, limiting the intensity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (the city wandering blind into the Crack vs her need to understand the watchers and her mother’s fate) and escalate coherently with each beat. Her agency—altering the note, persisting in playing as turtles veer toward the watchers despite citywide panic—drives the central reversal. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than physical; the external threat (falling into the abyss) remains somewhat abstract and untested on-page. Nonetheless, the converging pressures of civic danger and personal revelation credibly force her toward the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—exposing the monarchy’s noble lie versus personal and political risk—is clear from early on and meaningfully tightens when she actually holds the letter and when the watchman appears. The internal conflict (temptation to honor myth vs. determination to expose it) is nicely braided with the external one (avoid arrest/bureaucratic suppression), and her decision to evade rather than confront authority crystallizes her priorities. The cost is mostly projected into the future (ministers cursing her name, archives reopened), so the on-page price feels more conceptual than visceral. Still, escalation is coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes are internal: whether Mara can repurpose her technical role into a clandestine act of memorialization and confession. Escalation is present but subtle: from dropping ink into the lagoon, to small notes in cracks, to the keystone “heart” and direct inscription, culminating in her decision to leave and imagine future readers. There is felt cost—she trades straightforward professional duty for a secret, irretrievable exposure of herself—but the pressure never becomes acute or contested. The conflict is effective for a lyric piece yet remains low-intensity, which keeps it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the library’s catalogue will remain an instrument of enforced forgetting or become a vehicle of remembrance—is established early and steadily intensified. Pressure escalates via the blackout, the failing lantern, rising water, and Mara’s successive hypotheses about the stamp, culminating in the risky choice to extinguish all light to test her theory. The revelation that the catalogue was designed to erase pre-submergence history creates a genuine ethical conflict that she resolves by beginning a counter-index. However, the price of that stance (political danger, professional ruin) is gestured at rather than concretely dramatized, keeping the stakes more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—transmuting her daughter’s final dream into a sustainable form of goodbye—is clear from early on and carries through to the last line. Pressure escalates texturally: the paradox stair erasing sorrow from her face while adding “luminous torment” to her eyes, the humming engines, the increasingly costly flock of cranes that speak “mama,” and finally the expenditure of her own last dream as fuel. The resolution (letting the moonstone crumble, draining the basilica’s quota of sorrow) is earned and forecloses paths: no replaying the daughter’s dream again. The only reason this isn’t higher is that there’s little sense of viable alternate courses of action—no temptation to refuse the ritual or hoard the dream—so we feel deepening more than sharp narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stakes—how he will respond to the capacity to weaponize grief and unused potential—are clear and intensify as he escalates his “hunt” from minor perturbations to systemic harvesting to self-sacrifice. His agency drives the key turns: sabotaging the observatory, accelerating collection, then choosing to die to redirect a future strike. The ethical conflict (saving lives vs. exploiting the dead) is strong, though external opposition is largely absent, keeping pressure more internal and conceptual than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s hunger to locate her own “frequency of belonging” and possibly understand her parents’ fate—is well signaled, and the choice to pull the lever is a clear hinge. However, there is little antagonistic pressure: the pilgrim is helpful, the device works flawlessly, and no viable alternative path is dramatized, so the sense of risk or trade-off at the peak is muted. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional (the revelation of the moving star-map and the realization about her parents), not situational. The lack of real resistance or cost on the page keeps the conflict from feeling as high-stakes as the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep manufacturing lies or face his mother with the truth before she dies—is established early and sustained. Escalation comes through the revelation that his mother was his client and the search for the carved “portrait” that forces him to confront who he might have been, tightening his internal conflict. The fact that the mother already knows slightly softens the sharpness of his climactic decision, shifting the peak from a hard confession choice to a mutual recognition. The pressure is still coherent and morally charged, but the external confrontation is resolved more gently than the build-up suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—liberating Seris without granting either crown a symbolic victory—is clear and present from the opening. Pressure escalates not via reversals but by layering ritualized vulnerability (naming fears, sharing the lullaby, tying collective grievances) until the traditional instruments of power (spears, parchment) are rendered unnecessary. The visible costs are subtle but real: nations forgo a signed treaty; Kael relinquishes his talisman and accepts a heavier, less tangible burden; all parties discard formal grievances into an ambiguous void. The conflict stays mostly internal/ethical and could feel a touch decorous, but for this length the escalation is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will keep clinging to broken instruments and charts or risk a new, uncertain form of navigation—is clear and steadily pressured. Key tightenings include ignoring the chart to follow the blinking pole, enduring literal damage from the compass, and choosing to paddle beyond the last pole into open sea. The cost is largely internal and conceptual rather than dramatized as immediate peril, which keeps the escalation just shy of ferocious. Still, her final stance crystallization reads as an earned test of commitment, not a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—remain a safe, hollow construct or reclaim empathy by shouldering all inflicted pain—is sharply signaled and tightened by the lake’s explicit bargain. Escalation is coherent: curiosity → decoding obits → physically risky descent → metaphysical confrontation → irrevocable immersion that rewires his heart. The price is clear and non-trivial: he gains crushing awareness and responsibility instead of relief. If anything, external obstacles are minimal (no active resistance from the ward or environment beyond atmosphere), so the conflict is almost purely internal, but that internal pressure is handled with conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reclaim her sister without obliterating herself—is clear early and tightens as the ritual progresses. The turning point where the phoenix “screamed, feeling itself unmade” and she realizes “one of us had to die into the other’s form” is a genuine narrowing of options, not a decorative realization. Her final act of stepping into the circle and inhaling the shadow is a costly, character-driven resolution. Internal and external conflicts (attachment vs self-loss; human vs phoenix) are tightly interwoven.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can reconfigure her relationship to the lost child and stolen time—is clear from early on and tightens as the ritual deepens. Pressure escalates texturally: from time’s odd pooling to accusatory doll voices to the crack turning into a canyon and the lightning-bolt memory striking her chest. Her agency is central: she climbs, unfastens the cards, reads, traces the name, and consciously offers “cloudbound repentance” rather than having grief solved for her. The cost is legible but could be sharpened slightly by one more moment where accepting the rush of returned time visibly forecloses a more numbing or evasive option.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through sufficient, hard-won joy to redeem human shadow—is clear early and tightens as she commits to the sail and confronts the corridor of accusing faces. Pressure escalates from preparation in the shrine to the bruise’s opening to the moment she must not flinch and choose to stay. Cost is legible: she abandons any remaining freedom or companionship to become a permanent caretaker. The conflict is more metaphysical than visceral, but for this mode it maintains real tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can find a renewed form of purpose/identity after ruin—is coherent and present from the bottle’s introduction through the closing “different kind of currency” frame. There is a meaningful tightening when the volcano erupts and when they choose to enter the viscous glass, but external danger is quickly neutralized and never truly tests them; the mountain largely cooperates. As a result, escalation feels more like a guided initiation than a pressured struggle, with relatively soft on-page cost. Internal conflict could be pushed harder against genuine risk or refusal to reach higher-band stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—overthrowing control of the fort/sky-barges—appears early and tightens through concrete beats: clandestine meeting, lock-picking, confronting the generator, and Voss’s entrance as a real threat. The reversal with Voss at the generator, where Garnet must improvise and risk discovery, is the strongest pressure point and narrowest choice moment. Escalation is steady rather than razor-edged; success arrives with relatively little on-page sacrifice or near-failure, softening the sense of hard-won victory. Still, internal and external stakes mesh well, and the resolution clearly stems from Garnet’s decisions, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling the promise to understand sacred patterns despite the curse—is clear, and pressure accumulates as the rock sequence builds toward activation. The key tightening is when the star dust begins to sing and the curse briefly lifts, forcing a new stance on what “understanding” means. However, conflict is mostly internal and contemplative; there’s little sense of risk, alternative tactics, or concrete loss if he fails beyond conceptual/spiritual cost. The result feels powerful but more rhapsodic than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara’s voice can escape state erasure—tightens meaningfully when the lightning accident forces a shift from clandestine printers to cosmic broadcast. Internal and external conflicts (self-erasure vs. risky transcendence, physical scars vs. atmospheric “cartography”) are well braided, and the choice to dissolve the manuscript is an irreversible cost. However, tension remains primarily atmospheric and conceptual; no concrete opposing force ever steps onto the page, so pressure never quite spikes into genuine peril. The result is a strong lyric escalation rather than a fully harrowing one, appropriate for the mode but shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will their philosophical rivalry resolve as conquest or collaboration, and will they correctly “read” time’s invitation—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from latent rivalry in the waiting room to the formalized duel, then to the interpretive crisis around the brook and sundial. The pivotal turn (Vale’s paper slip and admission that he came to “wait”) is well-motivated but relatively low in immediate jeopardy; there’s no sharp external consequence for failure beyond missed understanding. The emotional and intellectual stakes are high enough for this length, but a slightly sharper sense of potential loss would intensify the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty/resistance can survive within and against the carceral system, crystallized in the fate of the library—is clear and tightened through Marin’s question “Can poems stop bulldozers?” and the impending demolition backstory. Pressure escalates with Rourke’s entrance and the risk of discovery, forcing Lark and Marin to improvise a bureaucratic survival tactic. The internal conflict (Lark’s thinning joke of “blooming resistance” versus the opportunity to become a “lantern-bearer”) is braided with the external stakes. The main soft spot is that Rourke is persuaded quite quickly, muting the sense of hard-won cost at the confrontation peak.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain in a curated, looping refuge of possibility or return to finite, uncertain time—is clear early and tightens as she moves deeper into the film-world. Pressure escalates when the film reveals multiple possible selves and the clocks point toward her fears, then again when the sky-garden’s roots drag fog through the reel, threatening to erase the boundary between loop and life. Her eventual choice to end the chord and leave feels like a genuine trade-off with cost (renouncing the fantasy of guaranteed reunion). The conflict remains mostly internal and lyric, but it retains coherent tension rather than becoming static.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant conflict—protect the Aya’s ridge/memory versus preserve her own foundational memory—is clearly posed and escalated, with the fissure revelation and thunder outside the dream forming a strong tightening. Calyx’s decision to plant the seed and pay the personal price directly resolves the external stakes and reconfigures her internal trajectory. The moral calculus (rigid belief vs luminous doubt) sharpens the choice without collapsing into a simple right/wrong binary. The only modest limitation is that resistance is brief; she hesitates, but we don’t see multiple tactics fail before the sacrifice becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to live with unspoken apologies—is signaled quickly via the glowing compass. Pressure escalates via the successive instructions: seeing the mother on the dock, untying the knot, then surrendering breath and forgoing speech at the dock to preserve the pattern. The cost is real but quiet: the narrator does not actually speak an apology, substituting ritual and lifelong practice instead. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no sharp reversal, which keeps tension from reaching the very highest band.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly internal and philosophical, fitting the "strip drama" motivation. While the external pressure (approaching storm) is effectively established, the protagonist's deliberate choice to ignore it—while character-consistent—dampens the external tension slightly. The internal reconfiguration is the dominant and successful engine here.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is primarily internal and retrospective, as the physical threat (the fire) is in the past. The stakes are lowered early when the protagonist disavows revenge or profit, leaving only an abstract search for "purpose." The resolution comes through a change in perspective rather than a decisive confrontation with the environment or the pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are thematic and personal—meaning versus void—and the pressure escalates well through the sequence of the tuning forks. The cost is subtle but legible in the "empty case" she leaves behind, a renunciation of her old tools. A sharper external obstacle or a more visceral price for the transformation would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (the rest of unmoored souls), the immediate pressure on the protagonist is low; he solves the puzzle and accepts his fate with minimal resistance. The "octopus tenure" provides a form of situational pressure, but the lack of a difficult choice or significant obstacle dampens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high (survival vs. erasure), and Lita’s warning provides a clear escalation point. The protagonist's response—tripling the runs—shows agency, though the cost of this choice is stated in future tense rather than felt viscerally on the page during the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the stranger acts as an immediate ally, and the ritual proceeds without risk of failure or complication. The "fracture" in her chest is healed through a cooperative exercise that lacks the requisite narrative pressure or opposition to make the relief feel staked.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the loss of photographs to the potential loss of humanity. The central conflict is resolved through active agency—the decision to sacrifice the halo rather than the self. The "price" of the door (becoming the keystone) is introduced late as a climactic twist, which works for this length but slightly compresses the pressure of that specific trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are conceptually high, but the immediate conflict is resolved too easily; the guards are rendered ineffective by "superstition" and are dispatched with a "waltz" rather than a struggle. The lack of a formidable antagonist reduces the felt pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established and the pressure escalates as the forge transmutes the silence. The cost is visceral—the "hemorrhaging russet" and the realization of her own guilt—satisfying the requirement for a felt price paid for the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central ethical conflict—whether to harm a stranger to heal the client—is sidestepped entirely because the thief essentially finds the solution in her pocket. The cost (giving up one stolen portrait) is technically present but feels low-stakes and emotionally negligible for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is primarily internal and atmospheric; while the "crash" outside adds texture, there is little external resistance to Mara's goal. The stakes are intelligible, but the lack of significant obstacles makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate appropriately with the arrival of the security guards, forcing a binary choice between flight and exposure. However, the resolution relies on the confusing mechanics of the shell-projector, which muddies the victory of the "outwitting" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation is driven by the dying star (time constraint) and the increasing weight of the booklet. While the internal conflict is minimal, the final choice to enter the map pays a tangible price (existence), securing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict remains internal and intellectual; the stakes are existential ("where thoughts come from") rather than urgent or external. The lack of an antagonist or immediate threat means the pressure comes solely from the character's own patience, resulting in a low-tension narrative arc that resolves smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.7)
    The stakes of clearing her name are established, but the climax resolves the conflict through coincidence (eavesdropping) rather than agency or sacrifice. The cost of resolution is negligible, as the antagonists voluntarily reveal the solution within earshot, removing the pressure for Mira to make a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are low; the setup of the "lowest luck score ever" promises conflict but delivers an immediate reward (the apple) without forcing a trade-off or difficult choice. The cost is purely conceptual (loss of the illusion of control), making the victory feel given rather than won under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined: the integrity of her own timeline versus the seduction of an unlived life. The escalation works well through the visual intensity of the hologram. The resolution respects the complexity of the choice, framing the status quo as an active decision rather than passive acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment magically aids the protagonist, and the ghost is purely benevolent. The lack of active opposition or personal cost makes the final epiphany feel unearned and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Conflict is effectively internalized, with pressure accumulating through physical symptoms and environmental pathetic fallacy. The stakes—purchasing temporary innocence at the cost of physical and metaphysical burden—are clear, and the release comes with a felt, tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tension is palpable, driven by the juxtaposition of the mechanical "clanging" and the silence of the tunnel. The stakes are clear, and the escalation—from passive listening to active engagement with the wheel—raises the pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is negligible as the protagonist faces no resistance or dilemma; the cost of self-erasure is high but accepted without hesitation, reducing the narrative arc to a procession rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is abstract (wonder vs. screens) and lacks an active antagonist or immediate physical stakes for Elara. The climax's obstacle ("whistle trembled") is resolved instantly by the keepsake without requiring a tactical change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is atmospheric and situational rather than urgent or antagonistic. The "swaying" of the silos provides a ticking clock of sorts, but the protagonist encounters little resistance in her quest. The cost—trading "solitude" for becoming the "axis"—is conceptual and resonant, but because her solitude wasn't established as a cherished burden, the sacrifice feels like a seamless ascension rather than a painful trade.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal and existential ("before the mainland forgot him") rather than immediate. While the departure constitutes a tightening of the situation, the external pressure from the Keeper or the "world" remains abstract, lowering the visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are immediate and high, with the priest exercising clear agency to alter the outcome. The reversal—using ambiguity to starve a demon that feeds on certainty—is a clever, earned escalation that leads directly to the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (complete the symphony before exhaustion), and the pressure escalates through the dwindling time and deepening memories. While the physical cost (exhaustion) is heavily metaphorical, the conceptual stakes are well-managed, leading to a satisfying release of the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is distinct and pressure-driven, moving from a navigational challenge to an existential confrontation with the Elder Kael. The "hiccup" in the algorithm forces a stance crystallization without feeling like a cheat, and the final choice narrows options to a single, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes are clear, and the cost of feeling the grief is articulated. However, the external obstacle—fixing the microscopic needle—is overcome in a summarized sentence ("All afternoon Mara worked"), bypassing the potential for high-pressure tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The external threat ("the tail") remains abstract and disappears once Elara enters the shaft, draining tension from the climax. The resolution feels relatively safe; the cost of "solitude" is something she already desired, making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The struggle to uncork the vial and inhale provides immediate, embodied pressure that anchors the internal emotional stakes. The conflict resolves clearly, though the external environment offers little resistance to his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear but the opposition is passive; the energy beings merely "offer" and "watch," placing the entire burden of conflict on internal reflection. While the internal struggle is coherent, the lack of active external pressure limits the feeling of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stake (renewing the bowl) is signaled early, the external pressure is atmospheric rather than obstructive; the world yields to Mara’s will too easily. The climax is an escalation of method, but the lack of active resistance or risk dampens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are clearly defined early (real feeling vs. counterfeit safety) and pressure escalates through the sensory interaction. The cost is legible—the loss of her protective detachment—though the external conflict with the chemist is minimal and static.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly felt and the thematic pressure is coherent, but the external conflict is low-voltage; the obstacles yield easily to cooperation and coincidence. While the final trade-off (giving the locket) provides a necessary cost, the lack of significant resistance prior to that moment limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (belonging) is clear, and the failure at the arbor ("glyph would not come") provides a necessary complication that forces the search. The twins facilitate the journey immediately, which lowers the tension, but the final commitment to the "deeper" path establishes a lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and signaled early—the trade-off between a moment of past closure and a span of future time. The escalation is steady, moving from physical exertion against the time-flow to the ultimate transaction at the aviary. The cost is paid on the page, satisfying the causal chain, even if the physical toll is less emphasized than the metaphysical one.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment poses no threat, and the puzzle offers no resistance. The stakes remain abstract ("balancing an equation") because the protagonist faces no risk of failure or concrete loss. The progression is a flat line of successful actions.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks meaningful opposition or stakes; the protagonist faces no threat of discovery or failure. The "cost" of becoming visible reads as a reward, resulting in a low-pressure narrative that resolves through sentimental inevitability rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from atmospheric threat to existential transformation, forcing a crystallization of stance under the Situational lens. The cost is total—loss of humanity—and is paid clearly on the page, satisfying the stakes established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is negligible; the initial scarcity stakes evaporate instantly upon meeting the helpful stranger, leaving no felt cost or difficult trade-off in the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly articulated as the burden of perception versus the comfort of the mundane. The escalation is steady, driven by the journey deeper, though the protagonist’s agency is slightly reactive until the attempt to return the gift. The cost is felt on the page (the scar, the fractured vision), satisfying the requirement for consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are theoretically high (healing the city) but operationally low, as the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or possibility of failure. The resolution with the woman is a soft trade of abstract promises, lacking a visceral "felt cost" on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The pressure escalates effectively from a desire to quit a job to a confrontation with the self. The central action—punching one's own chest to release suppressed truth—is a visceral dramatization of the stakes, grounding the abstract conflict in a physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (rationality vs. connection) are established early. While the pressure escalates atmospherically through the memories and whale song, the protagonist's resistance folds relatively quickly. The "cost" of abandoning her skepticism is paid, but the struggle to pay it feels slightly underweight.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Internal stakes (eternity vs. the unknown) are handled well, but the external conflict with the mutineers resolves with little friction; their immediate compliance reduces the scene's tension. The solar storm provides necessary pressure to drive the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is clear and the stakes are personal. While the magical ink resolves the external obstacle somewhat easily, the high internal cost preserves the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are largely conceptual; while the "hush" provides atmospheric pressure, the immediate cost of failure is low. The climax relies on a seamless magical process rather than a difficult trade-off, though the destruction of the glider provides a necessary moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential—erasure versus persistence—and escalate effectively from the personal to the systemic with the discovery of the poison. The drone patrol adds necessary immediate pressure, though the dying captain serves slightly more as an exposition delivery system than a source of direct conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The internal conflict—the myth buster confronting the limits of science—escalates cleanly through the three "notes." The climax forces a genuine trade-off: Arlen must abandon his reliance on measurement to complete the melody. The cost is abstract but felt as a shift in identity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly established early and escalate through the specific threat of the "stealth branding" and the inspectors' arrival. The conflict is resolved through active agency (the reorganization), and the cost is felt in the loss of stability and the admission that this is only a postponement. The tension between "survival" and "selling out" is well-maintained to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalated through the chemical countdown and the arrival of the terminator wind. The tension between the slow biological event and the precise, unforgiving chemical timer creates a strong narrative drive, though the reliance on the sand over the wristpad is a slight logical stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by both the ticking clock and the complexity of the repair, moving from a physical break to a software/psychological panic. The cost is paid in the protagonist's willingness to revisit her own trauma to solve the problem. The pressure holds consistently through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between institutional control (The Registry) and natural truth. The escalation is steady, and the final choice to withhold data and release the map downstream carries a legible conceptual cost regarding her professional duty.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict is largely external and procedural until the final beat; Elian faces no significant opposition until the north ward refuses to rise. The resolution (self-sacrifice) is immediate and lacks a moment of agonizing choice or alternative weighing, reducing the felt pressure of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally as the air runs low and the temple resists the signal. The central conflict is resolved through a meaningful sacrifice (the mother's vial), ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal pressure escalates well as Cassian climbs, deepening the thematic conflict. However, the external stake ("before they find the bodies") feels tacked on and doesn't materially alter his tactical choices on the page, leaving the urgency feeling slightly artificial compared to the strong internal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are high (eternal debt), but the protagonist (the ghost) faces little opposition; she simply performs a ritual while the boy submits. The lack of active resistance or a moment of genuine doubt means the escalation feels inevitable rather than tension-filled. The boy's agency is minimal, as he is guided by the ghost and sudden magical insight.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high (restoring the world), but the conflict lacks immediate pressure on the protagonist's agency. The "optimism sharp enough to haunt the dead" is asserted rather than dramatized through a struggle against despair. The resolution comes through a ritual act that, while beautiful, feels inevitable rather than hard-won against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (the boy helps instantly, the roots move themselves, the wood reassembles automatically). The resolution relies on magical assistance and dream instructions rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice, resulting in symmetric satisfaction without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of identity is well-pressured by the ticking clock of the mail drone. The final choice forecloses the option of full confession with a visible cost (the unmailed letter in the pocket), satisfying the requirement for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the external stakes (the fate of the republic) are high, the protagonist faces no effective opposition or personal cost. She navigates the coup plotters' den without a single setback or forced trade-off, neutralizing the pistol threat with a lack of friction that deflates the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are felt, but the medium removes the primary obstacles, acting as a magical fix for the communication breakdown. The protagonist follows instructions rather than forging a path through resistance, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal stakes are high, anchored by the specific memory of the massacre caused by a mistranslation. The pressure escalates well as the symbols on the cast reveal the depth of the boy's—and the narrator's—trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is procedural rather than pressure-filled; obstacles (such as identifying the pigment) are resolved immediately by the Lattice without significant struggle or failure. The consumption of the shard provides a structural cost, but the lack of active opposition limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high but strictly ontological (certainty vs. wonder), lacking a concrete personal or emotional cost beyond the metaphysical transformation. While the escalation through the nested layers is coherent, the conflict remains cerebral, missing the friction of a difficult choice made under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the antagonist Voss is defeated almost instantly by a sneeze and a Latin quote, offering no genuine opposition. The absence of sacrifice, risk, or tactical adaptation makes the victory feel inevitable and the conflict superficial.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure builds effectively through the rising wind and Zale's deepening fatigue, forcing a change in tactics. The stakes—maintaining a fragile cosmic peace—are felt, though the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is masterful, moving from the mechanical repair of the tube to the sacrifice of a cherished memory, and finally to the sacrifice of the self. The cost is not just stated but enacted, with the "payment" mechanism ensuring the stakes are felt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict escalates cleanly from the task's difficulty to the archive's active resistance. The resolution requires a tangible sacrifice (the vow of restitution), satisfying the need for cost, though the archive's capitulation is somewhat swift.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the stakes are established (blood vs. barley), the conflict exerts no real pressure on the protagonist because the solution is magical and absolute. There is no moment of potential failure, and the resolution requires no trade-off or painful compromise from the protagonist, resulting in a low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is theoretical (fear of capture) rather than immediate; the antagonist pressure (constables) arrives only after the protagonist has left. The lack of an on-page confrontation or a difficult trade-off under pressure flattens the stakes to a summary of success.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is minimal and the stakes are abstract; the protagonist moves from desire to realization with little opposition or cost. The "tightening" is a linear discovery of coordinates rather than a forcing of difficult choices, and the drifting house serves more as atmosphere than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmospheric pressure is effectively maintained by the sunrise deadline. While the conflict is primarily internal/thematic rather than interpersonal, the stakes of "shared exile" feel genuine and the cost (the atlas) is paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "pressure" is purely atmospheric (sadness/loss) rather than an immediate threat or time constraint. The resolution arrives via external magic (the bird's final seed) rather than a hard-won victory requiring significant sacrifice or ingenuity from Lira. The cost paid—"letting moments settle"—is conceptual but lacks visceral weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and low-pressure; Cipher operates with near-perfect control and safety, facing no active opposition. The cost is only hinted at in the final gamble, lacking a sense of jeopardy during the main action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear (memory vs. erasure) and escalate effectively as the sunrise approaches, acting as a natural clock. The cost is legible in the physical sacrifice of the moonstone and the pain of the inscription ("aching like cold salt"), satisfying the requirement for felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Mara faces no antagonist, time crunch, or risk of failure in her communion. The "debts of beauty" are abstract, and the resolution comes without a dramatized sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—silence vs. testimony—are legible and the cost (reliving the trauma) is felt on the page. The conflict is primarily internal and retrospective; the lack of immediate external pressure or an active obstacle in the present moment limits the tension, though the ritual provides a sufficient focal point for the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist ("dying consensus reality") remains an abstract, off-stage concept rather than a pressing force in the scene. The protagonist encounters no meaningful resistance—she puzzles out the equation instantly and the ritual succeeds on the first try—resulting in a lack of escalation or tension. The stakes are declared high but feel low because victory requires only a trivial physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is steady and atmospheric, moving from professional curiosity to existential annihilation. The stakes are clear, though the protagonist's ability to resist is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are established early and escalate cleanly from professional curiosity to a personal sacrifice of her primary tool. The conflict is externalized well through the mirrors' resistance. The final trade-off forecloses her previous way of working, satisfying the requirement for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative lacks active opposition or genuine stakes; the ritual proceeds linearly without a moment where failure feels possible. The resolution feels inevitable and smooth, missing the friction or trade-offs necessary to generate dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are internal but high, escalated by the approaching storm and the fragile nature of the echo. The pressure forces a stance crystallization: the realization that external preservation is impossible drives the protagonist to a transformative act of consumption.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined as eternal conformity versus the terror of freedom. The pressure escalates appropriately, though the opposition is somewhat abstract until the tangible cost of "alarming serenity" lands at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual, debating the role of art, which limits visceral stakes. While the burning stick introduces physical urgency, the resolution comes relatively easily. The "cost" is the loss of the stick and the pain of the burn, which is functional but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pressure is consistent with the genre, escalating gently through the arrival of the butterflies and the race against the dissolving roots. While the stakes are clear, the conflict remains largely external and atmospheric; the personal cost is felt but somewhat abstract ("loss or completion").

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and environmental, effectively pitting the protagonist’s patience against the "glacier’s erasure." While the stakes are high (memory vs. oblivion), the brevity of the piece limits the escalation of physical obstacles, though the tension of the ritual itself is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, external threat, or internal doubt, resulting in a ritualistic progression rather than a dramatic arc. The "cost" of transformation feels like a foregone conclusion, lacking the tension of a high-stakes trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The external pressure of the ticking clock (sunrise/heralds) effectively frames the internal conflict of preserving a legacy. While the physical obstacles are minimal—the door opens easily once the puzzle is solved—the existential stakes are high. The escalation works well under an Accumulative lens, deepening the mystery until the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is distinct and effective, moving from external subjects (Soldier, Girl) to the internal self, increasing intimacy and stakes. The final cost—feeling the "burn of every bomb"—is legible on the page, satisfying the requirement for a visible price paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the frustration of lost craft to a moment of physical cost, requiring a blood sacrifice to succeed. The climax is driven entirely by the protagonist's decision to wound herself, ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is low-resistance; the solution (bag contents) is immediately available and works without complication or significant sacrifice. The "forbidden" nature of the bag is stated but carries no felt penalty or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly escalated: the initial cost of inquiry is the loss of personal history, specifically kindnesses, creating a tangible price for knowledge. The climax forces a binary choice between safety (stopping) and truth (the final question), which is resolved with a permanent alteration of state. The pressure coheres well under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high (preventing war) and the final cost (a year of life) is a clear trade-off. However, the conflict remains largely cerebral and atmospheric; the "unheard symphony" and "crystal paragraph" distance the reader from the visceral danger of the "comma slicing his wrist," dampening the sense of immediate peril.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear but the escalation feels mechanical, driven by the "pulsing" card rather than difficult protagonist agency. The resolution comes somewhat easily through the discovery of the name, and the "cost" of the ship sinking is spectacular but lacks a visceral, personal price paid by the twins beyond the magical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are abstract and thematic rather than visceral; there is no opposition or risk of failure. Elara encounters no obstacles in performing the rebraiding, resulting in a narrative with minimal escalation. The "cost" of the ritual remains poetic description rather than a felt price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    High stakes (survival, erasure of history) are established early, but the immediate conflict lacks active pressure; the energy beings are passive environmental hazards until the climax. The ease of overcoming the Warden and the swift execution of the ritual reduce the felt difficulty of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than urgent; while the theme is high (meaning vs. nihilism), the physical stakes are low. The protagonist faces no active opposition or meaningful obstacles during her search—she simply walks, finds the object, and returns, removing the pressure required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates cleanly as the storm hardens, turning the abstract threat of erasure into a physical deadline. The impact of the fog pellet effectively raises the stakes from intellectual cataloging to immediate emotional intrusion. The final trade-off—leaving the accumulated memories behind to descend empty—demonstrates clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear, but the obstacles yield too easily to magical solutions (the dust, the single rocket), reducing the tension. The antagonist's surrender feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-cost struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    While the internal stakes are high, the external conflict dissolves too easily; the daughter offers minimal resistance before accepting the mother's metaphor. The resolution relies on a shared contemplative moment that bypasses the friction of the "difficult conversation."

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined by the time limit and the physical/psychological pressure of the climb. The trade with the keeper—a memory for a silence—introduces a necessary escalation and tangible cost. The climax presents a genuine dilemma (safety vs. expansion) that is resolved through agency, though the "audible colors" release slightly diffuses the tension of the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure is coherent and tangible, managed via the decibel limit which forces the commuter to confront their internal state. The "cost" of the journey—the extraction of a deep fear—is legible and provides necessary weight to the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is nominal; the deadline (sunrise) is stated but generates no panic, error, or tactical shift on the page. The protagonist overcomes the painted wall and the locked door with ease, paying no visible price (physical, emotional, or resource-based) to achieve her goal. The final acceptance of the throne feels like a reward rather than a hard-won consequence of a high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are stated ("fighting against the fading threshold") but lack visceral urgency on the page; the conflict resolves through a single exchange of dialogue and touch. There is no moment where failure seems possible, and the "cost" of the ritual is described abstractly ("drowning in his final moments") rather than felt through a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from psychological pressure to physical danger and metaphysical reconfiguration. The cost is paid visibly on the page (blood, renunciation of the diamond), ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict (truth vs. silence) is clear, and the physical cost (the cut hand) and conceptual cost (loss of name) are present on the page. Yet, the opposition is largely abstract until the Muse speaks; the lack of active resistance makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The escalation relies on a single sequence of actions without significant setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate beautifully; the knight trades his life for a metaphysical concept, and the price is paid explicitly on the page. The tension between the desire for redemption and the terrifying nature of the "possibility" creates a strong pressure cooker that resolves with a satisfyingly tragic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal—meaning versus erasure—but they are felt clearly through the protagonist’s actions. The escalation is subtle, moving from observation to the interpretative act of "reading" the dust, culminating in the physical intervention of the file. While the external pressure is low, the emotional cost of hope is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are high in theory but dissolve in practice because the conflict is resolved by a "magic bullet" victory; the police simply hesitate when they hear the broadcast. There is no escalation of cost—Mira succeeds without sacrificing anything or enduring a painful trade-off, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is handled with precision; the antagonist (the prophecy) evolves from a passive pressure to an active voice, forcing the protagonist to escalate his musical counter-tactics. The stakes—death, flood, the end of time—are high and clearly signaled. The final exchange feels like a genuine battle of wills with a visible physical and existential toll.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is a gentle environmental phenomenon that is easily resolved through cooperation and magic. There is no moment where Mireya faces a hard trade-off or a possibility of failure. The stakes are theoretical (equilibrium) rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central conflict (certainty vs. uncertainty) is clear, and the stakes rise appropriately as Elias descends. However, the resolution relies on a magical alignment that feels slightly convenient, and the cost of leaving his life behind is absorbed by the legendary summary rather than fully felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and procedural; Aurelia sets four limits and overcomes them sequentially without significant resistance or failure. While the emotional stakes are present, the lack of external pressure or complication during the ritual makes the escalation feel like a checklist rather than a tightening noose.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.0)
    Opposition is minimal; the giggle flickers away once, but the harp solution resolves the problem immediately without forcing Elara to adapt or pay a significant price. The snapping of the harp string is an external event rather than a cost paid by the protagonist, leaving the stakes feeling low despite the emotional subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Internal pressure escalates coherently as the “equations” shift from surrender to the painful acceptance of the asymptote. The climax involves a clear physical trade-off—pain for freedom—though the conflict remains largely internal and man-vs-nature rather than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal stakes are high, centered on grief and memory, and the "tightening" occurs as the market destabilizes. However, the external resistance is low; the protagonist navigates the obstacles and the magical transaction smoothly without significant opposition or the risk of failure, softening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate from a professional retrieval mission to an existential decision about direction and purpose. The pressure is largely internal but is externalized effectively through the ghost loop and the physical climb.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is coherent, moving from the quiet tension of the frost reading to the violent destabilization of the library. While the antagonist is abstract (the "perfect system"), the pressure on Corwin is palpable, and the final irreversible choice forces a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is clear, with the approaching "storm of time" and the intrusive archaeologist providing external pressure that forces the climax. However, the resolution of the antagonist—staggering as light passes through him and essentially being rewritten—bypasses a more active confrontation or trade-off, relying on the magical potency of the shard rather than a final tactical maneuver.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist (the rust/covenant) provides no active opposition, yielding immediately to the protagonist's speech. The lack of escalation or a moment of potential failure robs the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the pursuit of the unknown versus the safety of the collection. The cost is high and tangible—Ivy uncorks decades of effort, losing her collection to achieve her goal. While the antagonist is atmospheric rather than personified, the pressure from the environment and the visceral reaction to the vision provide sufficient narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through the storm and the thickening shadows, though the stakes remain largely aesthetic and existential rather than visceral. The escalation logic holds well under the Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and philosophical; there is no external pressure or antagonist, and the "cost" of waiting through winter is described lyrically rather than felt as genuine hardship. The protagonist's primary action is waiting, which results in low narrative tension and a lack of difficult, defining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from physical survival to a profound metaphysical sacrifice. The "meaningful tightening" is literalized by the lagoon demanding specific pieces of the protagonist's future, ensuring the final triumph comes with a palpable, irrevocable price ("futures closing like doors").

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bottle’s physical reaction (heating, vibrating) effectively externalizes the internal conflict; the climax creates a visible cost (burning the unique scrolls) that resolves the tension under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure is primarily internal but coherent; the "accidental prophecy" creates immediate stakes that challenge Ambrose’s desire for order/silence. The escalation from observing the wax to hearing his own future voice effectively raises the personal cost, forcing a trade-off between his peace and his duty to the city's grief. The resolution feels earned through this recontextualization of his life's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are effectively established as global (the flow of time) yet managed through intimate, focused action. The escalation is steady, moving from the visual spectacle of the reversing fountain to the high-pressure choice regarding the bead. The resolution doesn't rely on luck but on a sacrificial trade-off that feels earned within the story's established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clearly defined—sacred listening vs. civic noise—but the external conflict remains largely theoretical as the city sleeps through the event. The escalation relies heavily on the mystical "tug" of the rope, which resolves the decision for her rather than forcing a difficult trade-off with consequences. The victory feels earned by attention but not by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are internal but effective; the sacrifice of the grandmother's lantern is a tangible, high-value cost that anchors the spiritual transformation. The resolution feels earned through this renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fracture introduces clear physical pressure, forcing a decisive trade-off between the vow of silence and preservation. The stakes are legible and high, though the immediate blooming of the wasteland slightly softens the felt cost of the endurance he promises.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and philosophical, escalating effectively as the protagonist moves from observation to the active trade of his most valuable possession. While the internal arc is complete, external pressure is low; the "strike" of the numbers is a soft constraint that lacks active opposition. The cost paid at the end is significant, anchoring the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are purely abstract; the "wounded horizon" is a metaphor rather than a concrete obstacle providing resistance. The conflict resolves too easily—a torn sleeve instantly fixes the zither without failure or struggle—leaving the protagonist's resilience untested by genuine opposition or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are established immediately and escalated through the successful testing of the system (bats) and the encroaching physical deterioration of the protagonist (the tremor in month five). The pressure is coherent and steady, though the conflict is primarily man-versus-nature/time, lacking the sharp reversals of a more antagonistic setup.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is distinct and causal, moving from observation to a destructive test. The stakes are clearly translated from philosophical ("reaction vs. reunion") to physical consequences (the path's erasure).

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear (healing vs. war's remnant), but opposition is passive; the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's agency. Pressure escalates through stated physical exertion and intensifying imagery rather than active resistance or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is weak; the riddle is solved instantly by intuition rather than struggle, and the physical journey is summarized ("At the seventh kilometer") rather than dramatized. The protagonists face no significant resistance or setbacks that force a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes of grief and isolation are clear, but the external pressure is low; Kael enters the deck and the hatch without significant obstruction or cost beyond the existential. The resolution—stepping into a magical reunion—removes the weight of the "guilt of surviving" by allowing him to simply opt out of reality, which softens the tragedy. The escalation relies on a linear progression of supernatural signals rather than complicating choices.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear (amendment vs. stagnation) and the escalation is handled well through the surreal intensification of the sky and the game. While Vespers never feels in mortal peril, the conceptual cost—giving up her mentor’s relic and emptying her pockets to continue the cycle—provides sufficient weight to the resolution. The tension is successfully maintained through atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tension sublimates beautifully from potential violence to a collaborative defiance of erasure, maintaining high stakes throughout. The conflict is not resolved by force but by a shared recognition of loss, creating a "Charged Poise" ending where the silence is heavy with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the custodian's intervention and the trap of the "mutable cage," transforming a retrieval mission into a fight for identity. The binary choice offered—replant the talents to leave, or remain—forces a creative third option that feels earned. The pressure remains coherent from the inciting incident to the final collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal stakes are well-defined, and the escalation from passive observation to decoding and finally physical intervention works well. The "suicidal" king move raises the stakes by framing forgiveness as a form of ego-death/sacrifice, providing a distinct meaningful tightening before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and personal, successfully braided with the external pressure of the arriving priests. The escalation logically follows the magic system’s rules—amplification leads to overload, forcing a change in tactics. The cost of "listening" is dramatized well in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes are established immediately and escalate with visceral clarity: each snapped chain and held breath ratchets the tension between self-preservation and the protagonist's life's work. The trade-off is absolute and binary, avoiding soft compromises; the cost is paid on the page in full. The "transferred weight" of memory provides a strong thematic logic that justifies the physical escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the loss of the physical harbor to the race to preserve its essence before the light (and the quay) vanishes. The cost is palpable and paid on the page: Ren abandons the physical proof of his masterpiece to the dark to fulfill his internal promise.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pressure is primarily atmospheric and internal, lacking a sharp external test or distinct antagonist beyond the wait itself. While the ritual provides a form of escalation, the cost is abstract (time, emotional labor) rather than a visible forfeiture or irreversible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is exemplary, moving from mechanical repair to bodily sacrifice (hair, voice, then the self) in clear, time-stamped beats. The cost is unmistakable and rises with each step, and the dominant stake—the impossible return—is resolved not by success in the traditional sense, but by a transformative sacrifice that reweights the world.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are high and intimate; the pressure of the storm and the heating eye force a clear escalation. The external interruption ("Don't") is slightly convenient, but the protagonist's subsequent agency in using the eye and drinking the mud recovers the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is distinct and rhythmic, moving from external anomalies (gulls) to existential threats (the delayed reflection) to the climax of the stranger's return. The final trade-off creates a high-stakes resolution where the protagonist must sacrifice something personal to restore order.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no external antagonist or environmental hurdle, and the ants actively assist him. The internal conflict is resolved in a single paragraph of reflection without dramatized struggle. The stakes are theoretical rather than visceral, as the "rising creek" acts more as a metaphor than an immediate physical threat forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are visceral and immediate, escalating coherently as the "bleeding starlight" thickens and the threat of erasure intensifies. The final choice represents a definitive foreclosure of freedom to preserve the kingdom, satisfying the requirement for high-cost agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear—authenticity versus commercialization—and Mira’s arrival provides necessary external pressure. The escalation is largely conversational/internal, but the final action of destroying the pocket-sun effectively creates a felt cost and solidifies the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are intensely personal and existential, pitting the desire for linear narrative against the reality of the "wheel." The escalation moves from passive reading to active writing, and finally to the renunciation of the record itself. While the conflict is largely internal, the externalization through the scroll and the grave keeps the pressure legible. The cost is felt: she sacrifices the map of the future to inhabit the present chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal stakes are legible and poignant, centering on the struggle to find meaning after sensory loss. External pressure is minimal, and the conflict is resolved relatively easily through introspection rather than a forced trade-off or active struggle against a resisting world.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established—survival and the redemption of memory—and escalate naturally as the kettle heats and the storm approaches. The tightening of the time window against the physical failure of her lungs creates a strong, coherent pressure that forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear and personal, with the orchard’s destruction providing external urgency that forces the protagonist’s hand. The escalation is primarily internal, shifting from a ritualistic attempt to control the ghost to a vulnerable admission of failure. The cost is palpable—the surrender of her professional defense mechanisms to achieve genuine connection.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is present through increasing density (bowing shelves, heavy dictionary) and the physical toll of the spiral. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("cosmic illusions"), and the protagonist's compliance with the process limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high—the stability of reality and the protagonist's identity—and pressure escalates cleanly as the anomaly intensifies. While the conflict is largely internal and environmental, the choice to wind the clock backwards is a clear assertion of agency with a visible, transformative cost (dissolution of self).

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined, braiding the external professional risk of a "breach" with the internal risk of confronting grief. The escalation is steady, moving from sensor anomalies to the confrontation with the "familiar strangers." The conflict is resolved through a decisive internal and external action ("Let go"), though the antagonist (Dr. Voss) functions more as a guide than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Internal stakes are legible, but the external conflict is minimal; the protagonist's "risk" is stated abstractly ("risk... on openness") rather than demonstrated through a high-cost choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear: the cost of the loop versus the risk of the unknown. The escalation from "zero calls" to the physical meeting maintains tension effectively. The final renunciation—ignoring the first real emergency call—is a potent beat that proves the protagonist's shift in priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (memory vs. erasure), lacking immediate external pressure until the headlights appear. While the sacrifice of the locket is a distinct cost, the opposition (demolition) is abstract and distant, reducing the scene's active tension.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of loneliness are established early, but the conflict is resolved through a summarized process of success rather than a specific, high-pressure obstacle. The lack of a concrete "test" in the middle creates a smooth ride to the ending rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric; the "heaviness" of the ring provides rising pressure, but there is no concrete opposition or hard trade-off. The resolution comes without a visible cost paid in the moment, as the stillpoint accepts the offering passively.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are established early (distortion of history/meaning), but the conflict is resolved with relatively low personal cost ("power borrowed," "gravity slackened"). The protagonist fixes her social/professional mistake too easily, missing an opportunity for deeper sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks active conflict or escalation; the town’s silence yields instantly to the advisor’s influence without opposition, creating a linear progression of intensity rather than a tightening of stakes or a test of will.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a lack of rising action or genuine opposition; the protagonist faces no physical danger, time limit, or antagonist. The stakes are purely theoretical (understanding a promise) and are resolved instantly upon touching the artifact. The ending "collapse" adds artificial urgency after the conflict is already resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established as a battle for psychological space and identity. The escalation—from the garden’s overwhelming amplification to the lagoon’s threat of dissolution—is effective, though the resolution comes somewhat swiftly via the realization at the water's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain relatively low; the conflict is primarily man-vs-environment, but Mira's expertise mitigates almost all risk. The climax opens the door on the first attempt without a significant trade-off, cost, or reversal, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear, but the conflict is relatively low-pressure; the darkness is a willing pupil rather than a resisting force, making the success feel inevitable. The escalation relies on the ritual's progression rather than a sharp narrowing of options or a new cost paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely thematic and lack on-page pressure; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or risk of exposure to oppose the "humble rebellion." The resolution—a gathering where everyone agrees and no damage is done—avoids the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands. The narrative glides to its conclusion without testing the protagonist’s commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high (communal survival), but the escalation is somewhat linear. Lira faces little resistance from the townspeople; they overcome their fear ("fear shimmering like oil but feet moving anyway") almost instantly upon hearing her song. A stronger counter-pressure or a moment of failure before the final success would heighten the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conflict is internal but externalized effectively through the officer's skepticism and the act of whittling. The officer serves as a solid pressure point, forcing the protagonist to articulate her philosophy ("Grief is soil"). The stakes—authenticity versus survival—escalate cleanly to the final decision to suspend the performance and plant the stems.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the pressure escalates texturally (hum to word to breaking ice), the conflict lacks visceral stakes due to the protagonist's absolute competence and "certainty." The risk of the lake re-freezing is stated but never felt as a proximate danger, resulting in a procession-like pacing rather than a gripping struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, resolved through the magical device of the eye rather than a high-pressure tactical struggle. The escalation during the "three days" of exchanging plants happens in summary, which lowers the stakes' immediacy. While the smashing of the glass provides a physical climax, the cost of the "violent" color is described abstractly rather than felt through immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is no genuine opposition; the antagonists offer no pushback, and the stakes never feel at risk because the protagonist encounters no obstacle she cannot overcome with a single sentence. The conflict is static and resolves via immediate surrender rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is present but low-pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or hesitation, moving smoothly from one step of her plan to the next. The stakes are clear, but the lack of resistance—either external or internal—makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the structural truth of the collapse—is clear and pressures the scene. While the intellectual escalation is strong, the cost remains largely atmospheric ("measured silence") rather than viscerally paid on the page, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the "screaming equations" and defensive algorithms imply danger that never manifests in a forced choice or trade-off. The transition from danger to "new librarian" offer to escape lacks palpable pressure, dissolving tension into convenient acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict between the commodification of emotion and the preservation of authentic loss is sharp and well-dramatized. The cost is high—Mira's self-erasure—and is paid clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly internalized and escalated through the physical dismantling of Miren’s identity markers. The conflict resolves through a decisive act of release that carries visible emotional and professional cost, satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and high: the trapped miracle versus the protagonist's own blood/pain. The requirement of "fresh loss" provides a sharp meaningful tightening that forces a sacrificial choice. The cost is paid on the page, satisfying the demand for agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are personal but low-pressure; the conflict is primarily atmospheric rather than urgent. The escalation lacks grit, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure; the magical resolution comes smoothly after she performs the ritual, missing the tension of a high-stakes turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake ("Create, or perish") creates immediate, escalating pressure through the star-written warnings. While the conflict is largely internal and abstract, the physical cost of the dismantling and the final dissolution anchors the stakes in a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes (saving the children) are conceptually high, the on-page conflict is low; the guard faces no active opposition or risk of failure, only the physical exertion of the task. The escalation is procedural—steps in a ritual—rather than a deepening of danger or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clear—retaining self vs. achieving insight—but the conflict is resolved with relatively low friction; the protagonist accepts the jaguar's instruction almost immediately. While the cost is stated ("forget her name entirely"), the lack of prolonged struggle or failed attempts makes the sacrifice feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the characters face no significant obstacles or reversals during their search. The resolution comes too easily via the "star stamp," bypassing the need for a difficult trade-off or genuine escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tension is well-maintained through the surgeon's procedure and the bellhop's silent vigil. The transfer of the bolt serves as a meaningful tightening of stakes, creating a moment of defiance against the dominant pressure of the fortress.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain theoretical as the antagonist is a straw man who poses no genuine threat to the protagonist. The climax lacks tension because the hero is invulnerable and resolves the physical threat with a wave of his hand, paying no price.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist moves through the plot with minimal obstruction or trade-offs. The decision to descend feels inevitable rather than a high-stakes choice with visible cost, and the lack of time pressure or danger flattens the dramatic arc into a procedural sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks active opposition or the genuine risk of failure; the protagonist moves through a linear progression of success without facing obstacles that force meaningful trade-offs or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the climax deflates rapidly when the guard is neutralized by a sudden, low-cost use of the protagonist's power. The conflict resolves via a "soft reset" (soporific pollen) rather than a difficult trade-off or high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stakes are managed well, with the "freeze" exercise providing a clear mechanism for escalation. The cost is felt in the sacrifice of the photograph, a meaningful trade-off for psychological survival.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are immediate and physical (drowning) mirrored by the psychological need to finish the portrait. The pressure escalates tangibly as the lighthouse sinks "finger-width deeper."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible and the pressure escalates from a search to a metaphysical crisis. The final choice to leave reality is a clear renunciation with felt cost, though the "defense mechanism" explanation lowers the sense of immediate threat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (truth vs. suppression) are clear and the upload forces a permanent change. The lack of on-page opposition reduces the conflict to a mechanical task without immediate external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.4)
    Narrative pressure is minimal; the external "ruin" and "tremors" serve as background texture rather than active opposition. The stakes remain abstract and safe within the greenhouse, and the grafting process faces no risk of failure or complication to force a harder decision.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is clear: the goddess descends and threatens destruction, forcing Mara to abandon her net for the spike. The dominant stake (catching the echo) is reweighted at the climax, though the "unsung night" cost, while poetic, could be more viscerally demonstrated to heighten the sense of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate logically as the "orbit" resists Cordelia’s attempts to rewrite it. The "proof by contradiction" sequence provides a structured rise in pressure, culminating in a necessary sacrifice (the nib) that validates the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the internal desire for relief to an external, existential trap (the paper chain chorus). The pressure is coherent, forcing a binary choice that carries the weight of her potential consumption by the lab.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical and internal ("finding meaning"), which limits the visceral pressure, but the escalation of the "emergent hush" provides a functional substitute for conflict. The cost is paid through the sacrifice of the unique tile flake, satisfying the requirement for consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation is primarily accumulative and internal, lacking significant external opposition or time pressure in the immediate scene. While the ritual of collecting 49 pieces provides a rhythmic density, the absence of active resistance makes the stakes feel theoretical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stakes are poignant and the ritual deepens effectively, moving from longing to realization. External resistance is somewhat low as the environment (the maze, Lila) is largely cooperative, but the emotional cost of the "endless encore" ensures the tension resolves with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the geode cooperates immediately upon the static shock, and the solution is achieved through a "working through the night" montage without setbacks. The stakes are theoretically high (global madness) but operationally zero, as Mira faces no antagonist, failure, or trade-off to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes (loss of human echo) are high conceptually, but the on-page conflict is relatively low-friction; the protagonist faces an anomaly and resolves it with a single correct intuition. The physical cost ("collapsed") is present but feels like a standard transactional price for magic rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely conceptual (Prophecy vs. Agency) with very low immediate pressure or tangible stakes. The antagonist is a distant "cracked bulb" and an off-screen Abbott; the protagonist faces no resistance in her sorting and restringing. Consequently, the escalation feels textural rather than dramatic, and the final cost ("weight of choice") remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high and personal ("naming himself"), creating genuine pressure. However, the obstacles are overcome somewhat conveniently (the battery trick, the functioning transmitter in a derelict station), which lowers the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    The external pressure (the fading bridge/ticking gutters) is effective and forces a definitive choice. While the stakes are high (stranded vs. crossing), the protagonist's immediate, smooth compliance removes some potential dramatic tension; a moment of resistance or doubt would have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the wasteland's refusal to heal yields immediately to Lin's ritual without setbacks or escalation. The "thrum" acts as a flawless guide, removing the risk of failure and keeping stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are internal and abstract; while the "cages" are mentioned, the on-page pressure is low. Mara executes her plan without significant resistance or escalation—the theft occurred off-page, and the break-in proceeds smoothly. The lack of a "tightening" beat where success is imperiled limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is internalized effectively, but the external antagonist (the stone circle/chorus) surrenders too easily ("disappointed yet respectful"). This convenient retreat lowers the stakes at the climax, as the protagonist doesn't have to fight to maintain her boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are primarily conceptual—authenticity versus anonymity—and the escalation is driven by the ritual rather than interpersonal pressure. While the symbolic cost (giving up the nest/someone else's future) is present, the lack of a harder, more visceral trade-off keeps the tension relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly visualized through the livestream feed, keeping the abstract frequency war grounded in human consequence. The antagonist's adaptation (frequency hopping) forces a distinct escalation in tactics, preventing a linear path to victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the physical manifestation of the protagonist's phobia as the architecture distorts. The pressure is coherent, forcing a binary choice at the climax, though the resolution comes quickly after the key is found.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are high and personal; the physical cost (slicing her hand) and emotional cost (confronting the trauma) are legible on the page. The escalation moves cleanly from the external environment to the internal crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes of erasure vs. memory are compelling, the conflict resolution is rushed; Voss goes from threatening exposure to launching a dirigible in a single sentence based on a thematic question. This convenient turn lacks sufficient on-page resistance or negotiation, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is abstract (Art vs. Entropy/Death) and the escalation is linear, driven by the intensity of the performance. While the stakes are ostensibly life-and-death, the lack of resistance from the antagonist force (the "never") makes the victory feel somewhat inevitable. The cost—her own dissolution—is poetic but lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are primarily thematic and internal, which fits the quiet tone, but the conflict lacks visceral pressure; the characters agree too quickly on the method of their release. The burning of the shirt and the trading of the coin provide a felt cost, earning the closure, but the path there faces little resistance. The escalation is atmospheric rather than interpersonal or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist encounters resistance ("inscriptions resisted healing") that is overcome instantly by speaking, with no failure or adaptation required. The stakes are abstract, and the resolution comes without sacrifice, resulting in a friction-free narrative that lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are palpable and escalate cleanly from the physical threat of the seed to the existential weight of the truth; the final cost is visibly paid in the binding vines.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly drawn between "monoculture" and "living dreams," with the protagonist's body as the battlefield. The escalation is visceral ("thorns threaded through old wounds"), grounding the abstract conflict in immediate physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are high and clearly articulated; the trade-off (mother's memory for trauma relief) forces a difficult decision. The cost is felt immediately on the page ("warmth exiting," "cool silence"), avoiding a cost-free magical fix. The tension holds through the climax, though the resolution comes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are established early (financial ruin, humiliation), but the climax lacks friction; the foreman immediately pivots from canceling the contract to offering a new poignant role. The resolution arrives as a gift rather than a hard-won negotiation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and emotional; while the “arbor tilted” suggests physical danger, the pressure remains low. The resolution relies on a cooperative supernatural force (the mother’s spirit) rather than a difficult trade-off or high-cost decision from Mira, softening the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through the environmental constraints (moon pulling, tomorrow dissolving) and the resistance of the identities. While the stakes are high-concept (universal forgetting), the physical struggle of the smelting process grounds the conflict, even if the "storms of forgetting" remain a somewhat distant threat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high, but the conflict is low-friction; Mara yields to the cave's pull without significant external opposition or internal wavering. The escalation reads more as atmospheric deepening than rising causal pressure, though the final trade-off is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as psychological survival and self-forgiveness, escalated by the physical descent into the dark. The cost is paid visibly on the page through the loss of the father's accordion, a permanent and felt sacrifice. The pressure of the &quot;river inside her mind&quot; provides a coherent, rising tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are high (existence vs. silence), and the deadline provides pressure. However, the escalation feels artificial because the obstacles are overcome by the watch's magical functions rather than the protagonist's agency or sacrifice until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ticking clock of the melting violin provides excellent, organic pressure that forces a decision. The stakes—an empire’s future weighed against a single song—are high and clearly delineated, though the antagonist (the empire/status quo) is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preservation versus oblivion—is signaled early and resolved with a definitive cost (the protagonist's life). While the price is paid on the page, the conflict is largely internal and atmospheric, lacking external pressure to test the decision before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are high but resolved too easily by the magical "bell" mechanism, which instantly transmutes "unpaid sorrow" into wine and softens coins. This magical fix bypasses the difficult work of the inciting incident (the treason and debt), reducing the felt pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined: the destruction of the coral vs. the comfort of the researchers. The escalation is steady, moving from observation to a high-stakes confrontation. The cost is palpable on the page—Mira walks away unpaid, and the researchers are left stripped of their protective delusions.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pressure builds well through the sequence of rings, though the conflict is largely revelatory rather than interpersonal. The final cost—Marcus entering the cycle—is high and clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely conceptual ("finding the source"), and there is no active opposition or cost to the protagonist's progress. The conflict is resolved through a smooth slide into enlightenment, lacking the friction or difficulty required to make the transformation felt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by a clear external threat—the algorithm detecting the anomaly—that forces an immediate, irreversible trade-off. The dominant stake (the commodification of wonder) is resolved through a sacrifice that feels inevitable yet surprising, meeting the high-band requirement for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical; while physical danger is mentioned ("collapse the delicate archive"), it never manifests as an active obstacle that forces a difficult trade-off. The tension relies on atmospheric mystery rather than escalating personal or interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are existential and clearly defined, escalating logically from interpretation to physical dissolution. The cost of the final choice—surrendering human identity to become the signal—is viscerally felt and reweights the initial goal of survival.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the map's reaction to the roof's dissolution, forcing the protagonist to confront his own nature. The "boat sailing the air" to ask a direct question is slightly convenient, but the resulting psychological cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are cosmic yet grounded in the immediate return of the water, and the escalation from drops to minnows to waves is clear and satisfying. However, the conflict is resolved through a montage of endurance rather than a decisive, high-pressure turning point on the page, softening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear and the narrative arc tightens around the discovery in the bar. However, the conflict is resolved internally with a swift conceptual pivot (reframing scandal as shared memory) that lowers the felt cost. The antagonist is the environment/past, but the victory feels slightly too easily won through philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high—unraveling reality versus weaving wonder—but remain somewhat abstract until the climax. The escalation relies heavily on the "final transformation" ticking clock, which feels slightly disconnected from the immediate tactical choices until the final decision forces the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates cleanly as the glider breaches the perimeter, forcing a binary choice. The resolution, however, hinges on a surreal identity reveal and a safe "passing of the torch" rather than a costly confrontation with the consequences of breach.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are high and binary, escalating naturally through the ritual; the resolution exacts a visible, irreversible cost—the dissolution of individual selves—that satisfies the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is critically low; the antagonist (the threat of entrapment) is neutralized instantly by Mira's cooperation, leaving the narrative without a driving engine. The guests act as props rather than sources of pressure, and the "storm" remains a distant backdrop. There is no escalation of stakes, only a smooth progression of adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are intimate and high (restoring joy), with a clear escalation from mechanical failure to supernatural success. The "sniffle" provides a sharp, effective turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly internalized, with the opening of the boundary providing a concrete test of the protagonist's resolve. The choice to reject the "spring" world is a meaningful escalation of her commitment to her duty and her "friendship" with uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are well-defined and pressure escalates clearly through the ritual steps. The physical cost (blood) and the permanent consequence (blindness/loss of goggles) create a meaningful trade-off that charges the final image, earning a high score despite other flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the stakes (loss of all transmission) are high, the obstacle is overcome with minimal resistance or cost; the protagonist simply enacts her mandate without significant doubt or trade-off. The "price" paid (a sequin and assumptions) feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are visualized effectively through the "flickering" passengers, grounding the metaphysical threat in immediate imagery. The pressure escalates naturally with the closing grotto, though the specific price paid—beyond the breaking of the hourglass—feels more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical throughout; there is no active opposition or possibility of failure, as the gallery cooperates with the protagonist's efforts. The climax is an epiphany of understanding rather than a costly choice or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly articulated and escalated through the arrival of the alien ship and the boy's specific hope. The cost is unmistakable and paid on the page: the loss of the instructor's only relic to fuel the boy's future. Pressure coheres beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are established early, but the escalation is undercut by the protagonist's pre-emptive victory (the upload) and the antagonist's lack of effective resistance. The conflict resolves too neatly, with the opposition literally crumpling rather than forcing Mira to pay a significant price for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is severely undercut by the protagonist's omnipotent tool, which protects her from the environment and easily cures the victims. The antagonist (the signal) recoils passively without forcing a trade-off, resulting in a climax that feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a desperate bid for survival.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tension is palpable, driven by the ticking clock of the dawn correction. The shift from survival to offering solace provides a meaningful deepening of stakes, though the resolution comes a bit easily through the magical ink interface.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation is handled perfectly under a causal lens; the protagonist does not just endure the antagonist (the curse) but actively weaponizes it to achieve her goal, syncing her slowing heart to the language’s rhythm. The stakes are existential and the cost—her life—is paid clearly on the page. The tension rises steadily to the final swallow.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative lacks significant resistance; the antagonist (skepticism/university) vanishes immediately, and the protagonist surrenders to the transformation without a "no" beat. The stakes are high (humanity), but the absence of struggle lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are globally high but the immediate pressure is low; the antagonist (the statue) is bypassed on the first attempt with a single tactic, offering little resistance. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal where the protagonist’s plan fails or requires a painful adaptation, resulting in a linear procession to victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    The external stakes (drone, border guards) are established but resolved too easily by the magical elements, lacking a sense of genuine struggle or danger. The tension dissipates rather than escalating to a hard-won peak.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain low and primarily thematic; the conflict is between the protagonist and an abstract concept (silence/memory) rather than an urgent pressure. The climax—singing with memory—resolves the tension quickly and without a palpable sense of risk or sacrifice on the page. The "ache" in his throat is stated but not dramatized as a difficult obstacle requiring a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.2)
    There are no stakes or opposition; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, and the magic works exactly as intended without resistance. The narrative lacks escalation, functioning as an easeful vignette rather than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.3)
    Tension is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition or narrowing of options; the plan proceeds linearly to success. The stated stakes (memory loss) do not materialize in a felt way, resulting in a climax that lacks visceral consequence or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation to the mirror-breaking choice; the trade-off (surrendering her name to free the idea) is established and paid on the page. The stakes are internalized but dramatized through the external lock mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are intimate yet high—the reclamation of self versus the comfort of oblivion. The pressure escalates coherently as the mushroom urges surrender, and Mara's refusal is a meaningful exercise of agency. The cost is felt in the "tannic edge" of the reclaimed pain.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes—erasure of memory versus dissolution of the library—are clear, high, and immediate. The escalation works well through the tea leaves and the falling name. The resolution rewrites the conflict rather than winning it, creating a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that feels earned, though the specific cost to Lira in the final moment is somewhat softened by the successful escape.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is primarily man versus entropy, with the "weave between worlds" providing abstract resistance. The escalation is steady, but the pressure remains external and atmospheric until the loom buckles. The protagonist’s agency is mostly ritualistic performance until the final decision, lacking a moment where he must sacrifice a personal want for the greater need.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story lacks sufficient opposing pressure; the knots untie with relative ease, and the spirit is cooperative ("You're grounding me"), removing the potential for failure. The stakes (a restless soul) are clear but the protagonist faces no moment of genuine risk or trade-off. The escalation is merely the continuation of a task rather than a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure is coherent but largely internal and philosophical; the external stakes (equipment risk) are secondary to the intellectual puzzle. The resolution is an effective "Earned Stasis," though the conflict lacks interpersonal or physical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined as emotional and metaphysical, but the conflict lacks gritty, on-page resistance; the "variables" failing to balance is a metaphorical obstacle that dissolves quickly once Elias speaks. The cost of letting go is described lyrically ("irrevocably lighter") but feels low-friction in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is introduced but lacks teeth; the antagonist (the echo) challenges Lyra but capitulates immediately without forcing a hard trade-off or escalation. The storm functions as a background clock rather than an active threat that forces Lyra to abandon or alter her tactics in a costly way.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is largely thematic (joy vs. grief) rather than interpersonal, which fits the fable-like tone. The stakes are internalized effectively, and the "cost" of the thimble and her social position helps ground the final choice, though the external pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are existential and high (survival of memory vs. death), with the fraying cable providing a clear, escalating clock. Mara’s choice to spend her final moments recording rather than panicking is a strong assertion of agency that defines the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are immediate and irreversible; the cost—leaving the creation to be destroyed—is palpable and poignant. The external pressure of the demolition successfully forces the internal crystallization of her artistic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    The conflict evaporates upon contact with the solution; Lira faces no resistance, failure, or trade-off in the engine room. The absence of a "meaningful tightening" or "felt cost" leaves the stakes abstract and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict escalates cleanly when the standard tools fail, forcing Rowan to confront the mirrors' nature. The resolution requires a meaningful trade-off—collaborating with the illusion to fix reality—which carries a subtle but felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are high (survival), but the escalation is somewhat linear; the opposition (fear of ghosts) melts away after a few successful interactions. The cost of the harvest is described poetically ("sweetness that stings") rather than felt through a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are global but felt intimately through the protagonist's physical erosion. The escalation is handled well via the lullaby's iterations, and the resolution requires a permanent, irreversible trade-off that is vividly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early (travelers' lives vs. time/birds) and escalate cleanly when the standard method proves insufficient against the "seven lies." The protagonist exercises agency by destroying a sentimental asset to solve the crisis, paying a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is muted; the protagonist moves from problem to solution without significant external opposition or internal setbacks on the page. The stakes are declared (atonement) but the lack of operational friction during the creation phase lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between the vendor's incisions and the library's narrative stability escalates clearly, manifested in the physical distortion of the building. The stakes are abstract (the birth of a story vs. its stasis) but rendered legible through the "weight" on the scale and the branches. The final cost—the vendor's existence—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pressure scales effectively from human sorrow to "oceanic" grief, forcing a climax. However, the "felt cost" of the resolution is ambiguous; while Marisol pours her joy into the stone, the narrative focuses on her relief ("cleaner") rather than the weight of what she sacrificed. Without a clearer sense of loss or trade-off, the stakes at closure feel somewhat lowered.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes (silence of the elevator, farmers waiting) are clearly established, the conflict lacks visceral pressure or rising cost. The elevator's threat to "rot" is abstract, and Mireya's solution encounters no resistance, resulting in low narrative tension despite the high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are established early and are visceral: walking off a cliff versus resurrecting lost history. The escalation during the connection phase is intense, moving from physical sensation to hallucination to material manifestation. The cost is paid on the page in physical injury and the exhaustion of the "quaking" muscles.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation is well-handled; the ticking clock provides constant pressure, while the "seeds of vigilance" provide acute danger. The moment where her chanting (solution) wakes the seeds (new problem), forcing her to whisper (adaptation), is a strong beat of agency-driven escalation. The stakes remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    The pressure builds well through the ritualistic process, but the conflict remains largely linear (Man vs. Entropy) without sharp reversals or acute personal risk until the exhaustion at the end. A moment of greater doubt or active resistance from the materials would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no external pressure or escalation; the character enters, thinks, and decides to be hopeful without facing a new obstacle. The stakes ("the world," "noble children") are abstract and theoretical, never manifesting as a concrete threat in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely conceptual; the protagonist faces no external antagonism or risk of failure. The ticking clock of the fireworks provides mild pacing pressure but forces no difficult trade-offs or sacrifices. The resolution comes too easily, with the protagonist walking away "untouched" and successful.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    External pressure is negligible; the threat of "night-flying pollinators" remains theoretical and never forces a difficult choice. The protagonist succeeds on the first attempt without complication, resulting in low tension and a lack of meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    External tension is low due to Aera's hyper-competence, and the internal conflict is resolved without resistance. The climax lacks a moment of doubt or difficult trade-off; the "cost" of the memories is paid too easily to generate high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tension escalates cleanly from the initial wind vectors to the discovery of the body and finally the temporal displacement of the voice. The "voice one second ahead" creates a unique immediate pressure that forces a tactical change. The cost—surrendering the patch (and the connection to Holm) to the anomaly—is a legible, felt price for stabilizing the zone.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and the escalation is coherent, moving from physical navigation to internal sacrifice. The cost—stripping away protective scales—is stated metaphorically but lacks visceral, on-page resistance; the resolution feels earned conceptually but slightly low-friction physically.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are personal and well-defined, and the cost of the flute is paid on the page. However, the escalation is undercut when the solution (the driftwood spiral) is provided by the land rather than Kaelen's direct ingenuity, and the climax resolves via a lecture from the reflection rather than a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the intellectual puzzle of "transposing empathy" to the existential crisis of losing one's selfhood. The choice to reverse the press forces a clear trade-off: save the stars/souls at the cost of personal connection and fullness. The pressure is coherent and leads to a meaningful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain largely abstract ("memory to myth") and the escalation is driven by the magical object's vibration rather than the protagonist's decisions. The "terror" is stated but not dramatized; Elias accepts his apotheosis without a moment of genuine resistance or sacrifice that feels weighed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Conflict is effectively braided between the internal grief and the external resistance of the prism/car. The escalation—where "lies" serve as currency that eventually fails, forcing a truthful confrontation—creates a strong narrative drive. The final cost of leaving the object behind is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—connection versus voice—is clearly established and escalated. The climax forces a definitive trade-off with a visible, irreversible cost that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the villagers' "confusion" is passive, and nature yields without resistance. There is no escalation of stakes, as the protagonist encounters no risk of failure, physical danger, or difficult trade-offs during his labor.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes escalate clearly from a professional itch to a deeply personal and political confrontation. The cost—the weight of her own complicity in her lover’s death—is significant and felt. The narrative effectively converts the initial abstract goal into a concrete, high-stakes moral pivot by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are intimate yet felt; the dying lamp provides immediate pressure that tests the endurance of the keeper’s bond. The conflict escalates cleanly from the environmental (the dark) to the relational (fear of abandonment), resolving with the tactile confirmation of the warmed glass. The cost is the accepted loss of the light itself, traded for the safety of the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are cosmic yet anchored in Lirael's specific actions; the tension between the dead past and the unborn future drives the narrative. The cost is legible on the page—burning the wick consumes the character—providing a solid escalation to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.0)
    The stakes remain purely philosophical and abstract ("to learn why"), with no visible cost or urgency driving the scene. There is no consequence for failure and no price paid for success; the transition from seeker to teacher happens without resistance. The narrative lacks a tightening of options or a moment where Hoshiko must sacrifice something to gain the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accumulates coherently through the storm and the ritualistic process, though the stakes remain largely conceptual ("quantified sorrow") rather than visceral. While the trade-off—destroying the artifact to release the life within—is clear, the absence of a forceful obstacle makes the victory feel slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is distinct and pressure-filled, moving from a failed solo attempt to a communal effort opposed by the active antagonism of the "tarry vines." The climax requires a sacrifice that leaves a permanent mark (shards in ribs), ensuring the victory feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure is established via the midnight deadline and Vale’s approach, but the climax dissolves tension rather than tightening it. The protagonist’s surrender leads to instant transcendence, bypassing the visceral friction or struggle usually required to earn such a high-stakes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict between memory and erasure is clear but lacks immediate, high-pressure escalation on the page. The antagonist (entropy/the city) is passive, and the protagonist's success feels inevitable once the method is acquired. The lack of a "tightening" moment where failure seems possible or a significant personal cost is paid keeps the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are effectively braided between the abstract (loss of virtues) and the visceral (coughing blood, the slide shattering). The escalation is linear but potent, driven by the protagonist's agency in pushing the measurement until the tool itself fails, creating a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake (the relationship) is clear, and the escalation through the "dilating hours" creates palpable tension. While the antagonist (father) is absent, his absence functions as the primary pressure, leading to a definitive foreclosure of the relationship that is felt deeply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks genuine opposition; the protagonist seeks a mentor who is waiting for her, and the resolution is a mutual agreement to merge weather. There is no escalation of pressure, no narrowing of options, and no moment where the protagonist must make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clearly emotional and personal, centered on memory and legacy. However, the escalation is smoothed over by the environment's benevolence; the cave and lock collaborate to solve the problem, reducing the felt cost of the protagonist's confrontation with her grief.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the emotional stakes of loneliness are clear, the external threat (the toxic sky and wilting vines) evaporates instantly upon Aurelia's realization, retroactively lowering the pressure. The conflict is resolved through a "soft reset" of the magic system rather than a difficult trade-off or tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear (capturing the song), but the conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or risk of failure. The process feels more like a ritual enactment than a dramatic struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (preservation vs. loss) and pressure escalates naturally with the shifting magnetic field. The cost is high—K-17's individual existence—but the "inner static" acts as a somewhat abstract driver for the sacrifice. The conflict resolves cleanly through the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are conceptual and communal rather than sharply personal, but the turn from active solving to passive endurance is a legible tactical shift. The cost is "felt" (time, cold, patience) rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are established via the spider-clock, but the conflict lacks visceral resistance; the water partnering her and the dice solving navigation remove the struggle necessary for a high-stakes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear, but the on-page pressure is low. The conflict is primarily environmental and internal; the "city archivists" are an abstract threat, and the ritual proceeds with minimal resistance once initiated. The tension relies on atmosphere rather than an urgent, escalating counter-force.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are established early and escalate effectively when the prophecy fights back via the cricket legs. The resolution involves a high-stakes physical trade-off—swallowing the nightmare to contain it—which lands with genuine weight and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure creates a clear deepening of understanding; the tutor's departure forces the narrator to step into the teacher role immediately, foreclosing the option of passive studenthood. The cost is the loss of the specific connection, replaced by the heavy responsibility of the "stories the house had never told."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict between personal memory and state erasure is effectively escalated through the ritual. The story achieves a meaningful tightening when the process demands a specific payment (color for memory), forcing Mara to make a high-stakes trade-off that is felt on the page. The external antagonist is systemic, but the immediate pressure is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks active escalation; the conflict is entirely internal and retrospective, resolved by a pre-made decision rather than a struggle in the moment. There is no antagonist or obstacle testing Mara's resolve, resulting in static stakes that do not rise. The "calibrated treason" suggests high stakes, but they remain off-page backstory rather than immediate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are personal and high; the physical pressure on Lira's lungs and the risk of becoming a "hollow vibration" create urgency. The climax requires a difficult emotional confrontation, satisfying the need for on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric; the glacier "groans" but offers no active resistance, and the "digestion" of the ghosts serves as a timer rather than an antagonist. The protagonist meets no significant opposition or reversal, resulting in a low-stakes retrieval mission that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist seeks an object and finds it immediately through intuition without encountering obstacles, failure, or trade-offs. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical, declared in internal monologue but never tested by a concrete on-page threat or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are high and clear—comfortable lies versus painful truth—escalating from physical danger (radiation) to psychological endurance during the playback. While the antagonist is systemic rather than present, the cost of the final choice is viscerally felt in the "copper and shame" and the immediate degradation of the apples.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict between maintaining the status quo and embracing a destructive transformation is clear. The stakes are high—erasure of self for the sake of the future—and the escalation from listening to downloading to stepping through is well-paced. The internal opposition is resolved decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict—a request for a recording Posy does not possess—is resolved by a clever but low-stakes adaptation (bottling the wish itself). The cost is nominal (pennies she already intended to use), and the pressure remains low throughout, lacking a visceral moment where failure felt possible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalated when the initial attempt threatens to shatter the marina. However, the climax dissolves the tension too easily; the shift to the "mother whale" frequency resolves the conflict without forcing the protagonist to pay the price established in the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension builds effectively through the countdown and environmental pressure; while the external stakes of the revolution are high, the internal stakes are slightly dampened by the protagonist's unwavering control.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are well-defined, braiding professional duty with personal trauma. The resolution is earned, though the cost is largely internal and stated rather than dramatized through a difficult tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are high (an execution) and the pressure is sustained through the repair process. The turn where the mechanical repair ("give it beat") is insufficient without the moral repair ("give it mercy/evidence") is a strong escalation that deepens the conflict. The cost is felt in Emil’s risk and the weight of the warrant.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict is primarily man-vs-environment/puzzle, escalating effectively through the Algorithm's increasing mechanical urgency. While the personal cost to Juniper is relatively low (she risks time and effort rather than something visceral), the obstacle of the silent bell forces a distinct change in tactics that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—truth versus corporate continuity—is sharply defined, and the final choice carries a tangible cost (loss of identity). The external conflict is weaker; the security obstacle is overcome with a single summary sentence, placing the weight entirely on the internal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    The antagonist offers little active resistance, dissolving immediately upon hearing the magic phrase. The central cost—accepting empathy—is framed largely as a liberating power-up rather than a painful trade-off, lowering the stakes of the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high and clear (life vs. death), but the resolution is soft; the conflict dissolves through the coincidental sound recognition rather than a hard choice or sacrifice on the page. The tension dissipates into a gentle summary rather than snapping shut.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear—a life defined by error vs. possibility—but the escalation is largely internal and smoothed over by metaphor. The conflict resolves with relatively low immediate resistance; the protagonist talks himself into the solution rather than being forced into it by rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.3)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The pressure is theoretical (the fading echo) rather than a felt, immediate force that jeopardizes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no opposition, external threat, or risk of failure, making the outcome feel inevitable. The bee encounter is a moment of stillness rather than tension, and the resolution arrives as a gift rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low; the "apocalypse of language" is a background condition that exerts no immediate pressure on Elara's safety or goals. There is no active opposition, and the crystal cooperates immediately, creating a frictionless path to the realization. The stakes remain theoretical ("decoding a pattern") rather than personal or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly internal—the race against the "daily erasure"—and the pressure holds steady throughout the search. While external obstacles are minimal, the conceptual cost of the loop ("becoming" the decay) provides sufficient narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the moment vs. holding onto the past—is clear and tightens effectively through the countdown. The external pressure of the "Seismic Drift" provides necessary urgency to drive the internal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes (a peaceful death) are clear, and Calderon's brief resistance ("never learned to end things clean") provides necessary friction. However, Mara's mastery overcomes the obstacle relatively smoothly; the escalation lacks a moment where failure feels genuinely imminent, keeping the tension muted.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are globally significant and the cost of the protagonist's isolation is visible. The escalation is steady but lacks a sharp deepening of pressure or an acute "pinch" point where failure seems possible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear (truth vs. communal survival) and escalate through the confrontation with the changeling. The tension is resolved through a distinct shift in stance, though the "map" device slightly eases the pressure of the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clear (healing the village’s fear), but the on-page obstacle is minimal; the ritual proceeds with fluid success. The cost—the dissolution of the pearl—is thematic but feels low-stakes because the outcome never seems in doubt. The escalation is atmospheric rather than antagonistically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.0)
    The scene lacks immediate, active pressure; the "electric panic" is outside, and the garden offers perfect safety. There is no moment where Mira must trade one value for another or risk failure; Elias provides the solution immediately, and the recording proceeds without interruption or technical difficulty, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate logically from financial/professional pressure to an existential confrontation with her own creation. The climax with Lira forces a meaningful trade-off: releasing control to gain the courage to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are high in the abstract (saving the daughter), but the on-page pressure is low because the ritual proceeds flawlessly. The only resistance—her voice cracking—is overcome immediately. Without an antagonist or a moment where failure seems plausible, the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—finding the route vs. losing the memory—and the risk of combustion adds immediate physical tension. However, the external pressure remains largely static (the cold/silence), and the "flash-paper" risk feels like a managed hazard rather than an escalating threat that forces a desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict is an environmental puzzle solved through competence, lacking a sharp moment of risk or sacrifice. The escalation is steady but low-tension, as the protagonist never faces a true possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (personal entrapment vs. valley collapse) and escalate effectively as the lamp fails and the walls cool. The pressure forces a stance crystallization where the protagonist must abandon safety to succeed. The cost is felt and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is quiet and internal, centered on the pressure of memory against the discipline of the carving. While the stakes are low on the external axis, the "tightening" achieved by the decision to carve the smile creates a legible emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are intimate yet impactful, escalating clearly from a desire to map the past to a desperate need for reconciliation. The pressure builds coherently as the ghost rejects the protagonist's collected stories, forcing the final destructive choice. The cost of the resolution—shared erosion—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; mechanical obstacles yield instantly to the protagonist's touch. The "unsolvable equations" are resolved without struggle, and the lack of opposition or trade-offs eliminates dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear—Arlen's life work and sense of self—and the cost of leaving the prototype is legible. However, the conflict is low-kinetic and resolved quite smoothly; the "investors" are a distant memory, and the surrender happens with minimal active resistance, reducing the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the cost of the truth is the destruction of the father-myth. The escalation from suspicion to physical confirmation works well, and the final choice to leave the heirloom behind serves as a meaningful, costly release.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is clear, but the antagonist is a strawman bureaucrat who poses little genuine threat, and the resolution relies on the "chime" coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The stakes are high in concept but low in execution, as the immediate magical success and easy escape negate the potential cost of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, centering on the weight of the "explained absences." While the escalation logic works, the stakes feel somewhat abstract; the resolution involves shedding a burden rather than navigating a high-pressure trade-off, keeping the narrative tension largely cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate through the precarious assembly process. The cost is high and legible—the protagonist loses his sanctuary to achieve his goal—satisfying the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are purely internal and retrospective; the "anger" rises and falls without forcing a difficult trade-off or altering tactics. While the ritual provides a framework, the absence of active opposition or immediate consequence keeps the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and resistance is minimal; the box opens easily, the breadcrumbs lead clearly, and the memories release without exacting a visible price from Mara. The conflict remains abstract and internal without manifesting as an external pressure that forces a difficult trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict escalates effectively from the passive "falling petals" to the active choice of following the signal. The stakes are clear—dissolution versus transmission—and the cost of leaving the ancestral gear is a tangible sacrifice, though the "crack" sealing feels a bit swift.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are thematic rather than visceral; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely following a spectral guide to an inevitable realization. The pressure is low, as the grandmother's ghost provides all the answers without forcing the carver to make a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes are immediate and high, pitting the physical survival of the land against the economic order of the village. The escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency, and the resolution imposes a lasting, legible change on the world’s rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; Mercy encounters no significant opposition or failure states, solving the tapestry and finding the map on the first try. While the final locking of the door introduces a cost (isolation), the lack of prior escalation or resistance softens the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate viscerally, moving from environmental cold to the loss of identity and life. The cost of the final choice is paid on the page ("Each stroke cost her a memory"), satisfying the requirement for a decisive, high-stakes change.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate logically as the solstice approaches and Mila’s preparations grow more daring. The tension of the weekly sweeps provides a solid baseline of pressure. The resolution, while thematically resonant, dissolves the conflict somewhat effortlessly, reducing the felt cost of the confrontation with the Ministry.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and conceptual; while the Accumulative lens allows for textural escalation, the tension remains low as the outcome (completing the spiral) is never in doubt. The "tightening" is linked only to the mechanical stopping of the chair, lacking a sense of risk or trade-off that would give the final image greater weight.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes of truth versus erasure are clear and high, but the conflict remains largely internal and abstract until the final paragraph. The antagonist (the city/traders) is a generalized force, making the pressure feel ambient rather than acute until the closing confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and the cost (sacrifice of the voice) is clearly established and paid. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric; while effective for a fable, the lack of active external resistance or a "live" antagonist limits the tension to a steady, linear pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Antagonistic pressure is largely atmospheric (muffled loudspeakers) until the very end, where it is instantly neutralized by the protagonist's success. The escalation relies on a timer (the alignment) rather than active opposition, and the lack of struggle or setbacks makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are effectively raised from a static routine to the potential permanent loss of wonder. The conflict between the protagonist's nature (truth) and the requirement of the moment (lie) creates a strong internal pressure point at the climax. The escalation is linear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story lacks visceral stakes or escalating pressure; Elara identifies a problem and fixes it in a linear procedural fashion without risk of failure. The conflict is abstract (House vs. Entropy) and offers no moment of doubt or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a struggle between comforting stagnation and painful nuance. The escalation is internal but effective, driven by the journey to the arch. The cost is the destruction of the "fragile object," a tangible price paid on the page to achieve the thematic goal.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tension escalates cleanly from the monotony of the climb to the existential threat of the stairs losing their motion. The internal conflict between seeking closure and fearing the "hollow shape of climbing" is resolved through the high-cost choice to destroy the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; Mira encounters no active opposition, and the "cost" of her insomnia is reframed as a benefit ("lantern") without extracting a price. The resolution offers a thematic reward without demanding a visible sacrifice or difficult choice from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes are high (survival, cultural extinction), the reliance on summary prevents the escalation from being felt on the page. The conflict is resolved through a narrated montage of success ("children learned," "families singing") rather than a specific, high-pressure choice or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are life-or-death and clearly escalated by the "hunger stone" feeding on dread. The climax involves a clear moment of agency (cutting the string) with a specific, irreversible price paid on the page, satisfying the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clearly established as psychological survival. However, the climax—where the clasp snaps open "of its own accord" after the note is handed over—resolves the tension with a magical ease that bypasses a more difficult, active sacrifice or struggle from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear (stagnation in the Sea's Locked Jaw) and the escalation works well, moving from established methods failing to a risky improvisation. The "cost" is the breathless silence and the necessity of communal effort to power the raft.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension escalates cleanly from the tremor to the revelation, driven by the protagonist's active questioning. The stakes shift meaningfully from physical survival to existential liberation, with a tangible cost—the burden of the "terrible chart."

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are well-defined, contrasting personal safety with historical integrity. The arrival of the watchman provides necessary pressure, though the evasion is resolved relatively quickly; the internal cost of shedding family loyalty adds necessary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from placing paper notes to the riskier, more permanent act of writing directly on the stone. The internal stakes (release of memory) and external constraint (the drawbridge/tide) braid well, though the external danger feels more atmospheric than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally: the physical danger of the rising water parallels the intellectual danger of uncovering state censorship. The tension resolves through a meaningful choice to preserve the forbidden history, accepting the burden of a secret "private pressure."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal pressure is high and sustained, escalating through the ritualistic handling of the moonstone. While external opposition is minimal, the stakes of the ritual—the potential loss of the memory vs. the necessity of release—are palpable. The climax (inhaling the dream, folding the cranes) provides a satisfying tightening of these stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the abstract hunting of "potential" to a concrete ethical realization and a final, fatal trade-off. The cost is high, visible, and paid in full on the page, creating a powerful and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no on-page conflict; the "antagonist" is helpful and welcoming, removing all stakes from the interaction. The climax is a procedural step (pulling a lever) rather than a test of will or sacrifice. Without resistance or the possibility of failure, the "belonging" feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high and the internal pressure is palpable, driven by the mother's terminal diagnosis and the weight of the lie. The conflict resolution is softened by the mother's prior knowledge, but the emotional cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high (war/peace), but the immediate on-page obstacles melt away with minimal resistance. Kael silences a herald with a gesture and disarms guards with a tune; the lack of gritty, stubborn opposition lowers the felt pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved through convenient reframing rather than sacrifice or cost. The physical threats (wake, cold) are minor and quickly dismissed with a laugh, leaving the central conflict ("align heart and action") to be solved by authorial fiat rather than dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—the recovery of a painful self versus a hollow peace—is signaled early and escalates through the physical journey. The cost of the final choice is visceral and legible on the page, with the protagonist physically and mentally burdened by the returned memories.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is managed well, moving from the physical pain of the spice grinding to the existential threat of the phoenix's resistance. The final choice—sacrificing humanity to preserve the bond—carries a distinct, felt cost that validates the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is resolved through a deus ex machina moment where the grief is simply "unfastened" by the magic of the place. There is no trade-off or sacrifice required to achieve the healing, leaving the stakes feeling hollow at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tension is atmospheric rather than causal; the opposing forces (whispers, warnings) are paper tigers that test her resolve but do not endanger the outcome or force a hard choice. The climax relies on a passive "refusal to flinch" which feels pre-ordained by the fable-like tone rather than a moment of genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are nominal because the environment actively protects the protagonist, negating the threat of the eruption. There is no felt cost to the transformation; Kael gains wisdom without paying a physical, emotional, or resource-based price.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly established (revolution vs. tyranny), and the arrival of Voss provides necessary escalation. However, the resolution of the scene lacks significant on-page cost; Garnet succeeds without losing a resource or facing a truly difficult trade-off, as Voss is easily duped.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.6)
    Tension is virtually absent because the protagonist's curse removes uncertainty; he knows exactly what he must do and that it will succeed. There is no external antagonist or internal doubt to overcome, resulting in a procedural execution of a vision rather than a dramatic conflict with genuine stakes or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are existential—erasure versus transmission—and escalate effectively through the ticking timer and the intensifying storm. The "accident" of the overexposure serves as a genuine turning point that alters Mara's tactic from concealment to cosmic broadcast, demonstrating strong agency.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes remain abstract ("entry to the Council") and the conflict is low-pressure. The "duel" is symbolic and quickly becomes cooperative, bypassing the requirement for a tightening of options or a felt cost. The resolution comes through patience and a clue provided by the rival, rather than a hard-won victory or painful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal conflict—Lark's struggle to renew himself against entropy—is handled beautifully, but the external threat poses a problem. The climax relies on a convenient bureaucratic pivot that neutralizes the antagonist instantly, lacking the "felt cost" required for higher bands. The tension spikes well with Rourke's entry but dissipates without a significant trade-off or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the abstract pain of waiting to the concrete temptation of the film loop. The climax—realizing the film is rehearsal, not escape—is a profound deepening that forces the resolution without relying on external antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is handled masterfully through the ticking clock of the monsoon and the revelation of the fissure, which raises the stakes from observation to intervention. The climax forces a decisive trade-off (memory for stability), ensuring the resolution is earned through sacrifice rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are emotional but resolved through a guided procedure rather than a difficult choice. The protagonist obeys instructions to achieve release; there is no moment where they must sacrifice something vital or risk failure, resulting in low dramatic tension.

    Dominant stake—prove that local and cosmic change share a heartbeat—tightens once, at 03:17 convergence; options narrow to either accept quiet continuity or keep fleeing. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits the narrative of apocalypse. Agency is attention, not intervention; the decision to stand still forecloses her previous flight pattern. Slight reserve: storm #5 approaching is declared, not felt on her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once when the waveform captured includes her own complicity, foreclosing the innocence she arrived with. Cost is legible: the orchard drinks the fresher wound, petals chime regret. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory translation adds density until the final russet hemorrhage; no causal reversals are required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“craft safe zones for inquiry”—tightens when Mara realizes the zone must stay, not travel. One meaningful deepening: narrating shifts from self-soothing to world-addressing, proving language itself can solder cracks. Cost is the forfeiture of the first finished dome, a visible price on page. Accumulative pressure (density of thaw imagery) reweights the stake without need for external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prove that the trembling take has value—faces concrete test when guards arrive; screening the reel forfeits stealth and risks confiscation. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the projector choice forecloses retreat, turning exposure into the only path. Cost is visibly felt: security’s disgust and his own tears blur the rust into galaxies, proving price on the page. No off-stage coincidence; the shell’s instruction and the guards’ timing both stem from prior trespass.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the stunt industry’s lie of heroic invulnerability is undercut by a half-shell that valorizes the shake. The final image—stars spilling like unpaid extras while raw fear plays overhead—reconfigures vulnerability from shame to shared humanity. Subtext lives in gesture: the winged-lion sticker pressed onto a trembling hand re-prides a birth-sign once tainted by tyrant lineage. Only the closing aphorism drags the score a notch below perfect integration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: finish the map before the last star dies—signaled in line 3. Escalation is density-driven: each symbol (angled bracket, spiral, borderless smudge) consumes available light, tightening the hush until footsteps return delayed and doors recurse. The visible price is the booklet’s growing weight and the fort’s transmutation into suggestion; these constrain her final motion—she can only step into the outline she drew. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lens; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can thought be bootstrapped from repetition?—tightens when the robot realizes the program is not rehabilitation but forced evolution. Playing the violin is the one irreversible variation inside an otherwise closed loop, and it forces the stance crystallization: endure the cycle to keep generating thought. Cost is the eternal return itself; no higher escape is offered. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; a second tightening would over-pump this length.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—thaw mistrust—tightens when eavesdrop redefines the lens from evidence to olive-branch. One meaningful shift: knowledge that the “crime” was prank compresses Mira’s options to absolve or indict. Cost is legible: she forfeits moral high ground and accepts vulnerability by handing over the annotated ticket. No redundant intensifiers; coincidence merely reveals, not rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will measurable luck void forty years of devotion?—is signaled in paragraph two. Tightening occurs when 0.03% score appears and the garden immediately counters with the impossible apple; this deepening reweights knowledge: the Ministry’s math is irrelevant here. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational, coherent, and vegetative. Cost is the foreclosed path—she can no longer pretend mastery—paid in the moment she places marbles inside the glove, relinquishing narrative control. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; under accumulative lens this qualifies as meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—voice vs. invisibility—tightens each time a page dissolves, removing the safety of scripted notes. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: repeating water-damage motif reweights the stake from curiosity to survival-of-artistic-identity. Agency is continuous: descending each step is a renunciation of surface safety for deeper sonic truth. Final cost: he forfeits traditional repertoire and employability, now bound to “disrupt the world’s expected melodies.”

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“truth shaped like a seed” must be weighed before it sprouts—tightens when rootlet pierces diaphragm, forcing evacuation. Agency is renunciation: she smears every external leaf so the internal stone can surface, paying 4.7 g cost on-page. Escalation is density/cadence shift under Accumulative lens: each sketch warps heavier until the scale balances. No live antagonist, but pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—will Mara measure the swallowed truth—tightens through sensory accretion rather than external antagonist; each metallic knock inside the wheel raises cost of ignorance. The single reversal occurs when she unscrews the cap and the brass tag slides out: knowledge becomes irreversible, options narrow to bearing or denying. Agency is continuous; every roll, tilt, and final relinquishment is her choice under pressure. Price is visible: the eight names plus her brother’s, and her climbing away while the wheel keeps spinning—an equilibrium she must now indefinitely carry.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: witness without intervention. Escalation is textural—each swan-unfolding deepens the cost of witness until the only remaining intervention is to become the silence itself. One visible tightening: the war chronicle that bled saplings proves library refuses memory; thereafter she renounces saving. Final price is her erasure; tension shifts from “what will she save?” to “will she become the saved?”—a conceptual trade-off legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—reignite wonder—tightens through sensory accretion, not reversal. The whistle’s near-falter under totality supplies the one visible cost (steady breath spent), but the escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; options narrow only in the sense that magic becomes briefly visible. Because coincidence (eclipse) is the engine, agency is thin, yet the lens legitimizes situational pressure. Enough for high-band, but lacks a persistent constraint that would push 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will she keep the fragment or surrender it to give the walls speech?—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure accumulates texturally: each diary increases the ache of custody until the floor literally tilts, tightening options. The final decision to transpose dragons into concrete is an active stance crystallization under the “bronze quiet” pressure; cost is the now-blank fragment and her emptied solitude. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—own disappearance—signaled early; tightening occurs when fortune accidentally becomes self-prophecy, narrowing options to flight. Cost legible: forfeits home, name, buyer income. Agency drives every beat (film palming, cookie hollowing, oar strokes). No coincidence; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—starve the demon by fragmenting certainty—escalates via density increase: each loop dissolves meaning into texture, tightening the抽象 noose. Agency is present in the priest’s decision to step into his own loop, but the price is more conceptual than visceral; the demon’s “hunger without name” is felt abstractly rather than as bodily cost. The reversal is singular yet decisive; under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices. Would reach 8.8+ if a concrete forfeiture (voice, flesh, time) were legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—compose the unheard symphony before exhaustion—arrives early but its cost is conceptual, not visceral; no resource (time, stamina, tool-life) visibly depletes. Escalation is textural: each etched memory thickens the score rather than narrows her options. The 30-minute clock is lyrically announced yet never compresses tactics; dawnlight, not dwindling minutes, drives tempo. Persistent constraint (the ache) shapes the final stance but the price is spiritual, not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—singular identity versus fracturing multiplicity—tightens with each procedural misstep that spawns another ghost-Kael. The meaningful turn arrives when the algorithm deliberately leads through the fracture instead of around it, forcing a trade-off: enter and be cut by frozen seconds, or stay and drown in ghost-echoes. Cost is visible on the page: yesterday leaks out of the papercuts and puddles at his feet, a literal loss of time. The smash is the only remaining agency; all other paths have walked themselves off the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat numbness via reversed sound—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the backward lullaby physically peels “a translucent layer from the cocoon.” One meaningful deepening suffices: the reversed notes recover the laughing-sister memory, forcing grief to arrive loud inside silence. Cost is visceral (tears, exhausted filament). Agency is hers: she lifts the needle, presses the new drum to her chest. No coincidence, no abstract stakes—every intensifier is tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether weather truth survives censorship—tightens when Elara realizes the zone traps raw data, not disease. Her decision to inverse-date the strips pays an on-page price: she seals herself underground, forfeiting dawn-citizen life. Cost is visible; escalation is single but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: can Elian risk inhaling grief and still survive the memory pressure? Each aromatically cautious breath tightens the screw; the orchid’s sympathetic bloom adds the new note of hospital bracelet, forcing Elian to accept that the world *can* change yet smell identical. Escalation is textural—density of molecules equals density of loss—until the final exhale releases blue lanterns of ache, visibly paying the cost. No coincidence; every intensification is either Elian’s doing or the greenhouse’s engineered response to his offering.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—remain flesh or dissolve into collective light—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through micro-choice beats (touch rope, trace Marcus’s dig marks, decide to write patterns, walk out). Escalation is textural: each repetition of “texture vs. weightlessness” raises the cost of refusal. Protagonist’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves anything. Final narrowing forecloses transcendence with felt price—eternity lost, road and rope accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“beauty in the unfinished”—is clear from the first withheld harmonic. Escalation is accretive: each truncated phrase tightens the chronic hush until the hush itself becomes unbearable invitation. The persistent constraint (bowl crack, soil in a mendicant vessel) visibly shapes the tactic of wire-bridge creation. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the bowl, leaving the music forever open) rather than felt bodily, capping just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—feel something real—tightens when the scent subsumes memory and forecloses her detachment trade. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: she samples → grief/rage/wonder floods → she cannot sell the next vial. Visible price: a vial cracks, her coat empire literally leaks. The tightening is one decisive intensification, sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—her covert compassion remaining unseen—tightens when the envelope threatens to expose her network. The meaningful turn is her decision to draft a legal receipt under NGO pennant, trading anonymity for systemic good. Price is her locket and traceable name; escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—belonging—signals early; pressure tightens each time a heron tag is found, reweighting “webs of kinship” from inherited to forged. The mercury net revelation is the single meaningful deepening that forecloses solitude as a live option. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts perpetual visibility as a glowing glyph-guide for strangers. No secondary stake clutters the lane.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recover mother’s dying syllable—tightens each time a second is borrowed; visible ledger (digit-boats) keeps cost legible. Pressure escalates through cadence shifts that progressively forfeit future life; final doorway reconfigures meaning. No reversal beyond the one required; coincidence only complicates, does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—solve the master’s vanishing—escalates through one deepening: the silence shifts from eerie to equation-deficient, forcing the glass-eye ritual. The tightening is coherent under accumulative lens: each drip, click, and tile movement increases density until the astrolabe pointer arms the narrator with a next-step limit, not an answer—cost is the eternal approach.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the cached voices reach a living listener—tightens once: outage → silence → voices can be risked. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-chain; each new reel pushed through a gap adds decibel-pressure until the girl’s attention crystallizes. No reversible setback, but the final tightening (his own voice exposed) carries visible price: loss of invisibility. Cost is legible in the girl’s palm on the floorboards—social recognition that ends his exile. Agency is minimal but sufficient for 700 words; still, one more intermediate obstacle (a failing flashlight, a collapsing joist) could have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from artistic failure—tightens when the only currency left is insomnia itself. Mid-scene deepening occurs at shell spirals: recognition that pattern exists beyond individual failure reweights the quest from personal to post-human scale. Cost is visible: Mara must relinquish her sleepless perch to gain the water that never knew war. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but pressure coheres under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—tightens when the pearl dissolves into skin, foreclosing return to ordinary perception. Cost is visible: the seer’s futures collapse to a single strand, the pilgrim’s world is permanently overlaid with cave music. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: compile the scattered absence into a hearable future; pressure escalates through each missing piece of the trumpet. Agency is archivist’s—each negotiation (ledger clerk, janitor, cliff woman) narrows options and exacts visible price (empty satchel promise). The tightening is single but decisive: mouthpiece trade for future echo-archive; cost is felt in woman’s metallic memory and archivist’s public exposure at pier’s end. No coincidence resolves; the final note is earned assembly, not luck—under Accumulative lens the density of silence reweighted into sound is sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—speak or stay lost—signalled in paragraph 3. Escalation: each punched confession lights a compartment, narrowing option to board or remain. Cost is lit车厢-by-车厢; final canvas seals the trade-off. Stakes stay personal; no inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“can grief be solved by reason alone?”—tightens when starlight forces participatory memory; option to remain detached is foreclosed on-page. Each alignment is a micro-turn that raises emotional cost; midnight whale chorus bass note is the audible price. No coincidence; pressure accumulates under accretive pattern. Persistent constraint: once tile sings, refusal becomes impossible without betraying self-proclaimed kindness.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme—knowledge as communal voyage, not private proof—emerges solely through image shift: ink becomes tide-crests, notebook becomes communal score. No thematic statement; resonance is the hush between constellations made audible. Final non-literal answer: sky looks like “parchment waiting for the next brave skeptic,” reweighting academia into iterative chorus. Ambiguity lingers—no metric, no publication—yet feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will Vey keep roaming immortal corridors or exit into unknown darkness? Pressure tightens when fragments merge, foreclosing every direction but the wooden door; cost is the surrender of eternal witness for blank unruled dark. Agency resides in Vey’s offer—“I will step through so you never see me again”—and his final choice to proceed. Technicians’ mutiny complicates but does not resolve; coincidence (anchor failure) merely opens the threshold—Vey’s renunciation solves his own exile.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—posthumous asylum—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened exactly once: when the nib drinks the lullaby, “policy” becomes wet soap and options collapse. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is visible and felt (melody vanishes, Rurik trembles, cap cracks). Escalation obeys causal lens: each because tightens until the final charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—her compulsion to externalize invented pasts—tightens when the labyrinth begins to “grow real what had been only ink,” foreclosing the option to stop forging. The price is dramatized: she loses a sheet and must bear the heavier truth that “history is a bonsai, pruned by desire.” Escalation is textural: density increases until copper snaps and dawn brightens like paper to flame. Cost is visible—the ash snow fertilizes real decades—meeting the 8+ threshold, though the beat is singular rather than multiply braided.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased existence—tightens when each glued fragment narrows Mara’s options: the more voices she releases, the more she must stay nameless to avoid capture. One meaningful deepening: the poison label shifts from passive relic to active template for counter-archive, foreclosing retreat to former identity. Cost is visible: relinquishing death certificate = surrendering legal rebirth. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but legible under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decode the universal riddle—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when each note retells a voice at visible cost (shell cracks, cello completes). The fourth “note” of silence forecloses the old measurement path; he pockets the compass whose needle is now his pulse—felt price. Escalation is accumulative: density of resurrected voices → instrument completion → galaxy fireflies; no reversal, but a deepening that reweights knowledge. Coincidence is absent; every turn is authored by bow-stroke agency.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve communal autonomy—tightens when the Syndicate’s measuring tapes translate into “bigger barges and sharper contracts.” The meaningful turn is the overnight layout swap: libraries for gaming barges, poems for plush prizes; this forecloses the investors’ comfort zone and carries visible price (sunrise bread now free, bankrupt baker’s subsidy). Escalation is accumulative: each grotesque mask adds density until the city becomes illegible capital terrain. Cost is felt but not yet paid in blood or cash; the threat remains prospective, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: document the last blooming before UV sterilization. Escalation is accumulative—each anemone pulse tightens the countdown until the rose flush signals zero margin. The inspector’s agency is to keep the shutter open past the safe cue, enduring the full cost. Price is paid on-page: neural backup lost at sunrise, film now sole survivor. The tightening is single but decisive; no reversal, yet option set narrows to one final click.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of preserving beauty without also preserving loss; the camera becomes both archive and grave. Subtextual ache is carried in objects—hourglass grain, fossil imprint—never stated. Final image reweights “curiosity as mourning” from interior question to material fact: the photograph is the ghost. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—medical seeds must sail—locks in first paragraph and tightens with the horn. Escalation is causal: each spectrum reading narrows options, battery swell adds jeopardy, clock drops to seven minutes. Lira’s agency drives every turn; no coincidences rescue her. Cost is felt: she risks sending a still-jittery drone, her reputation and villagers’ lives on the line.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find whether rivers share a common origin—emerges via childhood question and Registry radio ping. Escalation is textural: each sensory pattern (condensation spiral, glowing river words) deepens the same obsession until the single underground estuary offers an answer that must either be reported or released. The tightening is the irreversible dissolve of her map-page: once the ink enters the living water, her data is literally unrecoverable—felt price on the page. Agency stays hers: she clips in, speaks “mayu,” and chooses to let the page go.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“rebuild Viremont via its own rhythm”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the north ward’s refusal forces the self-sacrifice beat, narrowing options to “give the piece of himself.” Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency each circuit; cost is visible when fork shatters into black sand and he becomes transparent. No coincidence resolves; wind is complication, not savior. The price paid (his humanity) alters tactics and charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—make the temple speak before air runs out—tightens exactly once yet decisively: when Mira risks her last unlogged memory. The scented drop’s translation into frequency is the single, visible price that alters options; failure means permanent silence. Escalation is textural, not causal: hush → resonance, solitude → signal. Cost is legible in the lung-burn and the emptied vial left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: will Cassian overwrite or surrender to the inherited lie? Pressure tightens when the hush refuses interrogation until fed his voice, then again when the lattice returns confession. Visible prices: forfeiture of silence (he speaks aloud), forfeiture of sanctuary (leaves lattice rotating inside), forfeiture of denial (claims the wolf). Agency drives each escalation—no off-stage rescue. Final tread on impossible stair narrows option to self-wolfing; cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ancestral debt—signaled in line 5; tightens when bead implants and dreams bloom. One meaningful escalation: seventh-night apricot pick severs guilt-thread; option foreclosed, orchard dies. Cost legible on-page: boy lifted to toes, light poured, trees wither. Agency shared: boy offers wrist, ghost guides hand—both pay.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can interrupted belief be re-circuited?—tightens when each vertebra alignment shortens the shadow, proving time still votes here. One meaningful deepening: brass mirrors fracture her face into twelve ancestral departures, making exile’s cost visceral. No reversal is needed; pressure accrues through root-bone knitting and the caretaker’s question that cannot be answered by theft. Final cost is the permanent caretaking she accepts, foreclosing further flight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—anonymity vs. self-revelation—tightens when drone arrives early; chalk spiral and unsigned letter become the decisive trade-off. One meaningful turn: she mails the mask, keeps the truth, foreclosing future recognition. Cost is visible—confession undelivered, map erased—under causal lens. Pressure escalates because time narrows, not coincidence; agency drives the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—republic survival—tightens once via the decisive hidden-layer ignition that converts map into live intel, foreclosing the coup path. Agency is hers: she chooses to read the “bedtime story,” forcing the confrontation. Cost is visible on-page: the pistol tremor and her acceptance of perpetual stitching show price. Under causal lens, escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—utter the withheld apology—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when the corridor offers one chance to seed the past. The shard’s transformation and the moths’ release constitute a single meaningful deepening that narrows options from silence to speech. Agency is renunciation plus speech; cost is the forever-loss of the letters and the visible cut healed. Pressure stays accumulative: spirits hush, roots breathe, corridor folds. No external antagonist needed. Sufficient for length, but the prospective payoff (brother “possibly smiling”) softens the felt price a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can naming absolve shared guilt? Pressure tightens when the birthday-date exposes the translator’s complicity, forcing him to voice rather than ferry words. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is the irreversible fusion of coral and cast—he leaves half the weight behind. Slight reservation: escalation is interior; external artillery remains off-page, so visceral price is poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim lost joy—tightens when the Lattice demands a living wall; price is each sigh of sorrow traded for pigment, and the option to keep memory private is foreclosed once the mural becomes public dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs certainty—signaled in nickel’s whisper and crystallized in final renunciation. Escalation is accretive: each fold drains color into possibility, tightening the cost of knowing. Protagonist’s agency drives every turn (she taps inverted note, chooses unmapped path). Price is legible: color ghosts, dissolved nickel, softening edges of self.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guard personal defiance before surtax on hope—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates each seed. One meaningful tightening: Inspector Voss’s arrival collapses time to satellite pass, foreclosing delay. Price paid: anonymity lost, seed pouch lighter, dawn exposure inevitable. Agency remains Arlo’s; luck (pollen sneeze) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—will the poet ever release the longing into something that breathes?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when he dares finish the postscript. The midpoint bead-touch revises knowledge, showing his child-self already tried mailing peace, doubling pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each dew-drop reflection thickens the cost of sleeplessness until the only remaining option is to surrender the card itself. Price is legible: the postcard, once planted, can no longer be clutched as relic—an irreversible forfeiture.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: the story posits that art (lullabies, postcards, shells) can metabolize historical pain into pre-emptive blossom-armistices. The final exhale of glowing petals is the non-literal answer—no moral appended. Subtext hums in the off-key wind’s syllables, never translated. Reef-shadow joy’s oxymoron captures the necessary union of bright sorrow and iridescent hope, an emotional after-effect that lingers past the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.7)
    Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names or marvels sink into mute white nothing”—is signaled in paragraph four and deepens with each bulb-flicker. One meaningful tightening: when “Por” cracks unfinished, the lullaby stakes jump from abstract rescue to specific beloved. Every sacrifice (cedar scent, pollen kiss, finally self) is a visible price that narrows Lira’s future to zero. Accumulative escalation holds: density of glowing names increases while her bodily density decreases, culminating in irreversible self-forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—restore trust through sonic translation—tightens once: from “translate” to “return what was stolen,” foreclosing the option to keep the score. Cost is the ink well itself and her anonymity, both on-page. Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent bloodshed between valleys—tightens once via the lullaby’s acoustic test that forces delegations to hear one another; price is the permanent vulnerability of future cycles, but the tightening is single and the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—evade capture while rescuing erased music—tightens when constables close in; every dawn flight forfeits rest and increases exposure. One meaningful deepening: Mr. Blackwood’s recognition of his wife’s lost tune converts attic archiving from solitary penance to shared sanctuary, foreclosing surrender. Cost is visible: Mirela’s identity is literally back-dated to a meteorite, her civil self annihilated. Coincidence (owner’s memory) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—learn the rhythm of belonging before sunrise—tightens when the automatic ascent clock starts. The shared exhale is the decisive, irreversible act that forecloses remaining alone. Cost is visible: she loses the atlas page and gains ghost-feathers she must someday honor. Escalation is situational but coherent; coincidence (hologram still powered) complicates, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will monotony be cracked open?—tightens when the soapy spill forces strangers into spontaneous confession and music; the option of dull predictability is foreclosed. Escalation is driven entirely by Cipher’s planted triggers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Price is visible: he sacrifices his only coin and any claim to credit, leaving the scene poorer yet victorious.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—remain erased vs. re-inscribe banned memory—tightens when each spiral subtracts her physical self to add forbidden verse. Escalation is accumulative: moonstone dims grain by grain, foreclosing retreat. Visible price (final grain burned) charges the closure image. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—illuminate value before sunrise—tightens when the auroral flare threatens brutal daylight audit. One meaningful deepening: violet lattice meets water, reframing mundane relics as luminous. Agency is ritual attention and spoken valuation, not combat, yet it forecloses the path of letting the world devalue these items. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the prism dissolves, its loss the price of communal re-enchantment.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate pain or stay mute—is signaled early; the tight/widening spiral physically enacts the deepening. Visible price: ash swallowed, burn ridges salt-washed, anonymity forfeited. One meaningful tightening: the box warms, fracture becomes projector, foreclosing private grief. Agency remains causal under lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing consensus reality—signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals. One meaningful deepening: shells spiral into new constellations, braiding wings, narrowing options to “write next variable.” Cost is conceptual (observer now watched) rather than tangible; visible price would lift higher. Agency is attentional—writing equation, pricking finger—but the turn hinges on symbolic surrender, not tactical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mira escape the archive or become it—signals at the negative self-portrait and tightens when she recognizes the Vale name. Agency is continuous: every step down the tunnel is a choice to keep looking. Cost is visible: her body dematerializes into corridor. The escalation is textural (density of negatives) rather than causal, but under Accumulative lens that suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—liberate mirrors from brutal truth into possibility—signals early and tightens when the third mirror demands the heartbeat’s forfeiture; this deepens the cost of her mission. Agency: she elects to gift the pulse, enduring permanent loss rather than eternal solitary painting. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirror vision layers denser stakes until the crack-sealing payoff. Price is visible: she exits “without compass or currency,” bell pigment replacing the sphere’s warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—memorializing the dead without erasure—tightens when Voss shifts from burning to naming, a reversible micro-turn that escalates emotional cost under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues via each name spoken and fragment placed, foreclosing the option of forgetting. Price is visible in cracked voice and crumbling terrace, meeting 8-band criteria, though the crowd’s unanimity softens the final pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo—tightens once: swallowing the note forecloses any external preservation, price paid on-page. Manufactured drought is not backdrop but active antagonist: cloud-seeding bribes, humidity calibration, held-back rain form coherent pressure. Protagonist’s agency drives every turn: he kneels, traces, swallows; storm answers his choreography. Escalation is situational—stance crystallizes in the charged hush—yet cost is unmistakable inside his body.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—break the lullaby or forever obey—tightens with each knot: snow retreat reveals predecessors’ stone corpses, making failure visible. Agency is continuous: every echo-thread she plucks physically alters the city’s dreamscape. Cost is legible in mercury tears and her own blood prints, though the final collective awakening briefly dilutes personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. public utility—surfaces early and tightens when the stick forces Lucien to watch his life in reverse. The deepening is textural: each translucent puppet adds ethical weight until the only remaining option is to embrace unresolved tension. Cost is conceptual but legible: he abandons the safety of elitist refusal and inks himself into the world’s messy questions. One meaningful intensification; no reversal overload—sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving names before glacier erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the card’s fragility forbids mechanical playback, forcing the improvised rope-loom transduction. One meaningful deepening occurs: the rope’s fibres “drank the pattern” and the pylons hum, audible cost that forecloses the option of keeping the paper. Protagonist’s agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is visible yet not persistent enough for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve old sky-knowledge from erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens once: the lattice reveals the sanctum door, forcing the vow of silence; no option to retreat remains. Cost is the astronomer’s corporeal life; felt in “tears salted his lips.” Under causal lens, escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can pre-war joy biochemically outvote post-mortem rage—tightens once when Lira realizes her own crates of anger must be metabolized; this deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for 600-word scope. Escalation is textural: each ghost’s thaw adds sensory pattern breaks that narrow pacifist options toward renunciation. Cost is legible—she forfeits the box and any future song, a concrete forfeiture paid on the page. Agency is interior yet active; her cellular surrender drives the final quieting of the sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recapture runaway dream—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation: failed mirror → orchard return → breath-seams → corridor → blood tether → sapling anchor. Each step narrows options under causal lens; blood loss is felt price. No coincidence; dream hesitation is reaction to her pulse-line.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit sanity page by page”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates each time Mara plucks a fruit and loses a past deed. Agency is continuous: she chooses to press the shell to the drain, inscribing the question that cracks the porcelain and germinates the Index door. Visible price (lost birthdays, apologies, library-book rustling) alters tactics, forcing her to accept curatorship of unlived life. The tightening from orchard to bathroom to Index is a single meaningful deepening that narrows options to fusion or erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—steal back unlearned lessons before they bloom into war—is declared early and tightens when the door demands an unspoken word, forcing Elara to barter her lifespan. Escalation is single but meaningful: the hybrid seed-word narrows options to “pay with death-time or fail.” Cost is legible (one year gone), though the traveler’s jeopardy feels auxiliary rather than reciprocal pressure. Absence-theft as tactic is inventive escalation, yet the global stakes remain abstract off-stage “war” rather than a visible impending casualty.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the lost shared name—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when blank cards and heat-spots foreclose easy answers. Agency: gathering syllables, sewing them into coat lining, reciting under drowning risk. One meaningful deepening: the maze shows three mutually exclusive origin stories, forcing acceptance of chimera identity. Cost is legible—ship, solitude, and singular identity are surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“translate confusion into clarity by giving the void a voice”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when each rope twist syllables a citizen. One meaningful escalation: frozen gears shiver, wax softens, letters rise and sink, forcing her to finish before the clock re-starts. Cost is visible: the village is folded into “the space between ticks” and Elara loses personal chronology (4 vs 3 chime). No external antagonist needed; absence itself applies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“carry the last map out alive”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the circle reading shows only one hour. The scored circle is a decisive, irreversible act that forecloses sound travel; price is the stone’s destruction and the mapkeeper’s self-exile from future voice. Agency is continuous: she scores, Jalen sprinkles, both wager death. No coincidence resolves; the beings’ dimming is direct consequence of the silence fracture. Cost is visible in the cracked relic and the unknowable reception of the sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens when the missing hush shard forces her to confront the child’s fate; retrieving it costs the desert’s absolute silence, a felt price that forecloses retreat. One meaningful deepening: silence escalates from personal curse to world-holding breath, reweighting the stake under Accumulative lens. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but her hand pries the shard free.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—crack the corked sky or surrender her craft—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened at the governor’s razor-thin consent. Escalation is causal: each covert prep (trade, dust, conceal) raises exposure cost until the single rocket becomes an all-or-nothing wager. Price is on-page: her satchel ends empty, the governor’s hourglass rule-set literally rewired. No coincidence resolves; luck complicates only when the sky first refuses to fall, then yields to her deliberate burn.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete spectacle: playfulness as insurgent gravity against calcified order. The fused mosaic heart drifting higher is the non-literal answer—serious play made artifact—reweighting “Remember” from souvenir to sky-writing without a stated moral. No final-paragraph sermon; the image does the work. Counter-readings (is she just another imposed wonder?) remain plausible, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing the conversational rupture—is signaled in line 2 and tightened only once, but that tightening (the daughter’s hesitant footstep) meaningfully forecloses permanent estrangement. Cost is visible: the mother’s apology is shaped like an insect, a physical forfeiture of pride; the daughter’s half-sob laugh pays the emotional admission price. Under Accumulative lens the pressure rises via image-density rather than plot reversals, satisfying the single-intensification rule.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“collect the flavors of different silences”—is signaled in paragraph 6 and tightened three times: three-plank exposure limit, memory trade, membrane breach. Each tightening forces a visible trade (memory, doll weight, skin stretch) under causal lens. The final renunciation releases rather than hoards, foreclosing the bunker path with undeniable cost. Coincidence is absent; every pressure is environmental or self-imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: preserving silence vs. need to speak fear. Escalation is gradated: early hexagon sign → commuter’s rising pulse → 30 dB breach → throttle easing → confession; each increment tightens the acoustic crucible. Agency is communal: Nilo slows the terrace to model silence; commuter must speak to reset crystals—both contribute to the reversal. Cost is conceptual rather than tactile: fear is sealed into new weather, a visible reconfiguration under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“until sunrise to find the stairway”—is signaled early; sunrise light shifting the waterfall colors supplies visible tightening. Escalation is textural: each peeled layer reveals older murals, each spiral step rejoins crown fragments, reweighting knowledge rather than narrowing external options. Protagonist’s agency remains high—she chooses to interface, to climb, to sit—yet the cost is conceptual (lifelong custodianship) rather than a concrete loss on the page, keeping the score just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: can the keeper teach a ghost to exhale so she can inhale? Pressure tightens once when shared scars ignite—one live option (link pain) forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual: perpetual self-suffocation becomes her oxygen. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word window; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can shame be converted into restitution?—is signaled in line 4 and tightens exactly once when bolt shears into diamond, foreclosing further debt cycles. Pressure is coherent under causal lens: each text narrows tactical space until "squeeze harder" becomes irreversible. Visible price—mushrooms dim, palm bleeds, ocean calms—makes cost legible. No off-stage resolution;Parallel-Liras complicate but do not save; final agency rests in her toss.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—dynastic legitimacy—tightens when the confession playback converts private guilt into public liability. One meaningful deepening occurs: the handle’s warmth signals Muse’s unseen presence, raising the cost of proceeding. Arin’s agency is absolute; every escalation stems from turning the crank. Visible price—blood on the atlas—pays for the choice and forecloses any return to dynastic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the shape of possibility—tightens when the knight realizes he must surrender agency itself. One meaningful deepening occurs: the discovery that the puppet will wear his doubts while he becomes the unchoosing hinge. The price is visceral: flesh becomes star-wood, veins become moon-thread, and every unchosen future coils inside his hollow chest. Escalation is accumulative: each surreal fruit and ticking seed adds weight until renunciation is the only remaining option.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—magnify a small kindness until it can “prove the past had not been waste”—is voiced on page 1 and tested twice: (1) dust-reading must yield legible hope, (2) button must be re-homed so a stranger might one day feel found. Escalation is textural: each dust glyph narrows her options until the only remaining act is to insert the button into Marcus’s null file—this deepening reweights the archive from dead-storage to future-compass. Cost is opportunity/time: she commits to endless nights of “brush poised” vigil; snowflake catch crystallizes that price on skin.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—keeping the prophecy unsaid—tightens through each musical choice: the diminished chord forces hush to retreat, the erased note costs him breath and voice. Agency is continuous; even the final whisper “Not yet” is spoken through the horn’s neck, an act that re-tunes the world. Only a hairline slip: the flood/telegram/diver futures arrive as a list, slightly diluting visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore grove equilibrium by remembering—signals with first rune leaf. Escalation is accumulative: each monument warms the dust speck, narrowing options to final release; the sky’s acceptance exacts the irreversible price of giving away the last relic. No coincidence; every upward leaf is answered by human craft. The tightening is single but sufficient for lyric frame: “the gentle weight of everything we refuse to let go” lands as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—owning self-invented time—tightens when the compass star and frozen watch synchronize, foreclosing repair-work forever. Agency sits with Elias: he wades, dunks, abandons. The price (chill “climb his ribs,” livelihood lost) is visible on page. Pressure accrues via pattern (3:17 repeats) rather than external antagonist, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can grief be transmuted into usable gold—escalates through four successive limit-tests, each narrowing the tactical field: weigh → calcine → seam → anchor. Agency is pure alchemist: every beat requires manual action (scraping rust, folding tears, lifting molten gold) that visibly forecloses retreat. The twentieth ounce of tear-gold is the on-page price that charges the final image. Coincidence is excluded; storm-water and furnace embers are already causally resident.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can pain be solved—tightens asymptotically: each equation narrows the gap without closing it, a visible price paid in bruises and ozone. The forest’s UV ledger escalates by calibrated millijoules; protagonist agency resides in choosing to keep walking and counting. No external coincidence; pressure is coherent, internal, and inexorable. The final +1 in the denominator (“plus one being the forest”) is the single meaningful deepening that makes forgiveness legible as limit, not arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“honor overlooked histories”—tightens when the painter’s dated heartbeat proves the fragment was always owed back. One decisive reversal: instead of collecting memory, the protagonist surrenders it, foreclosing the translator path. Cost is legible in the “heavier absence” and the scaffolded rooftop lighthouse that must now operate without inherited glass.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—break or repeat the time-loop—is signaled by the ghost child’s finger-pointing at the ceiling. Escalation is textural: each recursive image (ticket snow, her own silhouette in the elevator) thickens the air until the choice to leave the barrel becomes a stance crystallization rather than a new plot event. Cost is conceptual: she accepts perpetual ascent with cracks, forfeiting the fantasy of perfect repair. No causal reversals, but the tightening of shimmer-ghost ladder suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redeem a failed revolution by reimagining it—tightens when the shard shows the unbuilt city, then narrows further as the time-storm threatens to erase even that dream. Her mirror-covering method is an active, costly escalation that forecloses retreat. Price is legible: bodily dissolution and permanent exile from the new world she births. Under causal lens, because/therefore linkage is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore city’s color via honesty—signaled paragraph 3. Escalation occurs through a single irreversible tightening: confession → covenant acceptance → sky fissure; agency remains Elias’s throughout. Cost is dramatized on-page: personal shame exposed, keepsake annihilated. No off-stage shortcuts; coincidence only complicates earlier midnight theft but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—will she surrender her explanatory need?—is signaled early and tightens when the lagoon demands tribute, not testimony. The decisive turn is her active uncorking of every vial, a visible price that forecloses her collector identity. Cost is legible but not deeply persistent beyond the image; the whistle-echo feels luminous rather than taxing, keeping it just outside the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether memory or escape will govern her art—tightens when the spiral projects living debtors; each cut forecloses the safety of generic sculpture. Cost is legible: she sacrifices GPS certainty and the lantern itself, leaving her palms an “unmarked map.” Escalation is textural deepening rather than causal reversal, fitting the accumulative lens. Storm complicates but does not resolve; the final quiet is earned by her carving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“understand why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled early and deepens through seasonal absence. Tightening occurs when snow retreats and moonflower buds appear; the bloom is the living answer, no external antagonist needed. Agency is attention/endurance rather than confrontation; cost is the winter-long solitude and eventual act of leaving. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; one meaningful intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. filial safety—is signaled the instant the lagoon spells her nickname. Escalation is accumulative: each shell-grammar configuration reweights the cost, trading away named future dates until the final page surfaces and forecloses silence. The visible price is literalized as ink poisoning risk and the civic spectacle she ignites. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient; here every new page raises the public stakes, culminating in the loudhailer kerosene-drop.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“let the truth outlast the comfortable lie”—is signaled in para 1 and tightened when the bottle demands to ingest the scrolls; refusal narrows future options to perpetual lantern-burning. Escalation is accumulative: each lantern consumed = one scroll released = one street renamed, a visible price that depletes both material and memory stock. No coincidence; pressure is strictly situational, forcing stance crystallization into the ash-ink epigraph. The alchemist’s agency is continuous—every paste, fold, burn decision is his, none delegated to off-stage luck.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reopen linear time by decreasing entropy—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the bead offers a either/or swallow. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn: she renounces both preservation and surrender, instead circulating the spiral, a choice that visibly costs her the seeds and embeds half the vortex in her heartbeat. Price is legible on-page; options narrow from cosmos to cap to cracked bead.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the mountain speak and will she answer?”—tightens when 03:17 pressure dip forecloses the safe siren option. Single meaningful escalation: rope tug forces bell substitution, narrowing her path from civic obedience to mountain courtesy. Price is instant: illegal toll, public wonder, personal jeopardy. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates (wind shift), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve unspoken words or watch ghosts evaporate—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the pane cracks. Agency is renunciation/speech: he forfeits lifelong silence to seal the fracture, narrowing options irreversibly. Escalation is single but meaningful: each absorbed word increments physical weight in his ribs; the crack makes abstraction visceral. Cost is on-page: shared breath cools dusk, clover scent returns—undeniable proof price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rediscover felt time—signals early and tightens through each price-tag description; the fragment trade forces a concrete forfeiture, narrowing options from keeper to participant in the new barter economy. Escalation is textural: blank tape/newspaper vs. inked tags heightens the contrast between erased and remembered time. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is visible but not irrevocably painful.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the poet chooses to let the chord hover rather than resolve. The zither’s broken third string buzz creates a micro-turn that forces joint tending; twisting sleeve-strip to tune it shows visible price. Escalation is accumulative: each shard adds tonal tension until the shared music and spoken lines crystallize the suspended moment. Cost is legible: the poem is “not finished but sufficient,” a doorway left ajar that forecloses completion.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“chemistry of homecoming” vs. nostalgia’s isotope—tightens through each sculpture failure; the seventh bronze figure’s eroded face signals the last narrowing option. Escalation is driven by her agency: placing amber on bronze → tower hum → spore inhalation; each step raises molecular cost. No reversal is required—the deepening is the revelation that belonging is a toxin she must metabolize. Visible price: wings dissolve inside her bloodstream, foreclosing any future return the offworlders promised.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will the battlefield keep bleeding or be gardened—tightens when the “forgive” pod is chosen; that single act forecloses the option to carry weapons again. Escalation is textural: each dead language syllable adds silt-weight until the metal flowers bloom, releasing the treaty chord. Cost is visible—tongue blood, empty box, rust-feather tucked—and the final road widens only because the bitter acre surrendered its bitterness. No coincidence resolves; the gull’s testimony complicates but the coachman’s agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens when the riddle forecloses every path but naming the leaf. The archive scene is the single meaningful deepening: wax-light reveals answer, needle skip pays cost, tactics irrevocably narrow to olfactory coordinates. No reversals are needed; one escalation under Accumulative lens suffices. Cost is visible: the leaf warms against skin, wax softens, scent of orchard replaces gunpowder—price is sensory, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can ritualized memory resurrect connection? Pressure tightens when the compass twitches, then explodes via hatch-maps that force Kael to crawl into mother-made space. Cost is permanent exile from chronology; the price is felt but could be even more viscerally foregrounded in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—ownership of the sky’s rule vs. apprenticeship in wonder—tightens once: the bishop swap tilts the board, converting Halcyon’s fear into upward momentum. Cost is visible (he floats away forever; Vespers surrenders her talisman). Agency is hers, but pressure is soft: Halcyon never counter-maneuvers or raises the stakes after his knight move; escalation is more conceptual than contested. Still, the single turn forecloses his old life and opens the child’s, satisfying short-form escalation threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve small gestures before the next king erases them—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the gallery demands "Record us." The single meaningful deepening occurs when Kestrel kneels and asks for the maid’s name: the stake pivots from solitary archive to shared remembrance, costing Mara her invisibility. Agency remains hers; she chooses to walk the final overlapping sentence rather than escape. No coincidence resolves the tension; the dawn bird merely marks the deadline already internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim home without re-enslaving town—tightens when custodian demands she re-bury talents. Escalation is causal: each shelf-shift narrows her route; the quill of her own scales literalizes skin-for-stone trade-off. The visible price is her mercury-glass skin shattering—loss of future prophecy—paid on the page. One softening: custodian’s “reality by subtraction” remains abstract, never concretely alters terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are legible from line 1: guilt vs. self-forgiveness. The single tightening is the moment Marek sees the suicidal king-sequence embroidered—this reframes his penance from puzzle to witness. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: accepting the “loss as instructive” rather than erasable. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal and lands with visible village-unfreezing consequence.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: forgiveness is not amnesia but re-patterning the board. The suicidal king and the “board is wider than the mistake” murmur reweight each other. No final-paragraph thesis; the breeze carrying threads skyward is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity is productive—reader must decide if meeting the daughter is possible—yet emotional aftereffect is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—scatter blame before priests arrive—signals at “one hour to make the spire sing.” Pressure tightens when the canyon starts repeating her own lines (“both palms bleed”), foreclosing the option to keep the queen’s plea private. Agency is renunciation: she stops reciting and accepts listening, which fractures the spire and releases the feather; cost is legible. Under Accumulative lens, density balloons until the pattern snaps; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—quilt memory into meaning before chains fail—tightens via each crater-to-dot translation; the irreversible snap of the last link forces her stance crystallization with a felt price (the workshop). Escalation is coherent, single-cycle, and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—salvaging the quay’s image—narrows to preserving it inside an unseeable space; the shell’s reveal is the single meaningful tightening that forces the paint-scrap postcard. Agency remains Ren’s at every step; no coincidence rescues or resolves. Cost is legible: he trades public visibility for subterraneous permanence, forfeiting hometown return. The pressure curve is one steady crescendo rather than iterative reversals, sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove soft vibrations reach farther”—is signaled early and tightens as each sensory beat purifies intent. The boat’s barely perceptible course change is the earned reversal, visible price paid in lifelong vigil she embraces. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is internal and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reverse migration into lost geography—tightens when each call forces her to trade personal substrate (hair, voice, weight) for reclaimed town. Escalation is textured: moon waning → censer lighter → dunes reversing → her coat grows heavy, foreclosing retreat. Final price is her erasure as navigator, crystallized when bronze crumbles to dust she inhales.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: break the memory-debt cycle or remain its custodian. Pressure tightens when each lens rotation “spins the debt tighter,” foreclosing the option to keep the flower. Releasing it costs slices of personal recollection—visible price that alters her interior ledger. The escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; the stranger’s lack of on-page resistance keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake—escape the inherited life—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the ants offer the single live path and the rising creek closes the return route. Cost is legible but off-stage: his shop is being flooded while he chooses; we infer rather than feel the loss. Agency is present yet lightweight; the decision is a single step rather than a tactical adaptation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—existence in others’ memory—tightens from first paragraph’s “kingdom would forget her name” to last line’s cracked-mirror release. One meaningful escalation: starlight thickens from mist to crown, trading remembrance for cosmic repair. Agency is continuous climb; no outside rescue. Cost is paid on-page: “every mirror in the kingdom cracked at once,” audible price of her ascension.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“how to capture presence without killing it”—tightens the instant Corin decides to crush rather than sell the sphere, paying the visible price of seven years’ commerce. Escalation is causal: each reflection on “absence” he has sold propels the final act of release. Pressure peaks when Mira’s whispered breath charges the shell, forcing the either/or between preservation and sharing. Cost is on-page: the pocket-sun’s destruction sears their palms and ends his Guild-protected livelihood.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can narrative outrun erasure?—tightens when each new line she writes is literally dissolved by snow, a visible price that forecloses the option of permanent record. The scroll’s vanishing is the decisive reversal: the grave becomes optional, the wheel confirmed, the chronicler’s job reduced to ephemeral naming of splinters. Cost is legible on-page; the stone remains as mute witness that no hiker will ever read.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are signaled early: rewrite grief or repeat it. The typhoon clock tightens options stroke by stroke; the twelfth seals both rune and breath, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible—crystallized shards become speakable words—yet escalation leans on poetic compression rather than a second tactical reversal, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she earn forgiveness—tightens when the drop refuses to fall until she speaks aloud, foreclosing the miracle shortcut. Agency drives every turn: she chooses speech over scent, then archives the empty bottle, accepting permanent echo instead of neat absolution. Escalation is lyrical but legible: silence → spoken confession → visible notation cyclone → fading ghost → chainsaw 4/4. Cost persists: orchard destroyed, perfume spent, apology irretrievably public.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake is the dissolution of identity in exchange for cosmic unity; pressure escalates as each memory slides down the spiral until no options remain. The tightening is singular but meaningful—one continuous accretion rather than multiple reversals—yet the cost is felt on the page when the last letter of her name is erased, foreclosing any return to linear self.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove what clocks really measure—tightens when uphill water voids physics, forcing counter-clockwise turn. Reversal is protagonist-executed, not coincidental; cost is the erasure of both station and identity. One meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word Accumulative design; pressure mounts via pattern break (water) rather than successive causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve or release her brother—tightens when headset shows identical quantum signatures, collapsing “original vs copy” into irreversible choice. Each fold forecloses retreat; the spiral merge is the last live option. Cost is dramatized: one man exits, composite and unreadable. Pressure escalates under causal logic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: will Mira repeat father’s compulsive pattern or convert it to agency? Pressure tightens each time a scrawl rewrites her route—option space narrows from avoidance to engagement. One meaningful deepening: reading “Bet on the thing you refuse to see” forces acknowledgment she has refused to see him—and stakes her prior detachment. Final circulation costs dawn hours, anonymity, and the lantern itself; price is visible and alters future tactics—no more voyeurism, only reciprocal inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—loop vs. line—tightens via each call: the child’s requests force the operator to test his estrangement rule until the final offer of the rail becomes unbearable. Escalation is accumulative/textural: the disc’s chord grows louder, the tunnel gate vibrates, the stakes reweight from abstract myth to embodied departure. One meaningful reversal: he teaches “step one frame beyond it,” then must live the lesson. Cost is felt: the phone’s first real emergency rings unanswered, forfeiting his sole social function.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save small moments from erasure—tightens when engines growl; option set narrows to “sketch faster or lose forever.” The final steep act (sealing locket inside tube) pays the price: she forfeits private memory to public future, foreclosing retrieval. Pressure is accumulative: each added sensory layer (sunflower, laughter, ink bloom) increases density without external antagonist. Cost is visible in empty cuff.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness via reciprocity—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through each story-swap that narrows Kit’s solitude while raising the cost of eventual departure. One meaningful tightening: when the tally on the ticket wall nears zero, the community risks losing the very condition that created it, forcing Kit’s exit. Agency remains with Kit throughout; coincidence (Lila’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve. The price—permanent exile from the paradise he seeded—is felt on the final platform image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-mapping versus self-erasure—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is textural: ring absorbs extinct birds’ consonants, cane dowses toward silence, options narrow to inward or void. Protagonist agency present in every step and final renunciation. Cost visible (ring bloat, sealed clearing) yet slightly abstract; could be sharper to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she thresh meaning without destroying herself—tightens when anomaly flares silver and pen reservoir of “contingency” empties further. One decisive deepening: she rewrites her own prior error, foreclosing the option to blame external static; consequence is station brownout and bodily float. Agency is renunciatory: she accepts responsibility for pre-threshed experience, edits curvature rather than erasing act. Cost is on-page: power borrowed, gravity altered, child’s laughter re-tethered from mockery to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the town recover its own silenced music? Pressure escalates by subtraction—each deleted sound lightens the emotional ballast until only the chord remains. The tightening is conceptual, not strategic, yet it forecloses the option of perpetual industrial hush; after the chord, silence is no longer absence but unfinished song. Cost is borne by the advisor—he vanishes, camera relinquished—visible in the final image of the turning capstan.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover truth behind grandmother’s promise—is signaled in paragraph four and sharpened by the collapsing archive that forecloses return. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each artwork decodes a layer of map, tightening the noose of knowledge until the tapestry re-weave flips destruction into preservation. Cost is visible: the real archive is lost again in the collapse, making her new knowledge irreversible and solitary. Agency is present—she burns false libraries, descends, claims fragment—but the final beat could foreground a sharper micro-renunciation to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she recover sole ownership of her pulse?—tightens via drumming crescendi that literally loosen foreign veins. Escalation is density-driven: each new ghost note raises the cost of failure. Visible price: when last heartbeat exits, lagoon clears, leaving her smile framed by communal veil—loss of pure solitude is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the whisper network—arrives late (mid-story) and is carried by the guest, not Mira, muting protagonist pressure. Escalation is atmospheric (storm intensifies) more than tactical; Mira’s agency is facilitative, not decisive. The sealed door opens via inherited key + inherited chant—no live trade-off or risk. Cost is conceptual (her maps incomplete) rather than visceral; tension plateau stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teach darkness its own worth—signals early and tightens through each shutter angle adjustment; the meaningful deepening is the mirror-fold that forces darkness to carry rather than consume light. Agency is attentional and renunciatory: she cedes her scream’s echo and offers starlight away, paying with permanent solitude. Cost is legible: the drifting apart of shutters equals relinquished control, and the canal’s new under-glow will outlive her. No coincidence; all pressure accrues from her calibrated placements.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate the town’s rigid rule-set—signaled in line 3. Escalation is accretive: each mannequin-window plants a visible question, tightening institutional surveillance risk. The final graft costs Mara her coach authority, foreclosing future matches on “sixty-four squares.” Price is legible; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—will the island stay and what myth will survive—tightens when each floating timber locks into kelp-willed spiral under Lira’s song. The whale-call deepens the cadence, forcing a public stance: she must teach others to dive rather than chain them to decay. The price is visible—old ground dissolves into foam—foreclosing any return to blade-bound identity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can anything grow in post-mandate grief—tightens through pattern-break: first fake hydration, then real tear darkens soil; performer’s agency drives each shaving/narration beat; cost legible in officer’s scratched badge and crow’s lodged feather; escalation is accumulative deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will the poet survive her own linguistic breach?—tightens when each paraphrase risks re-freeze around her calves. Agency is continuous: every voiced phoneme either melts or cracks the surface; cost is legible as hairline fissures and the statue-threat. One meaningful deepening suffices: “None shall stay” replaces “None shall pass,” and the lake lifts into communal wings.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find beauty without color—tightens when the marble eye forces Milo to confront chromatic violence. One meaningful deepening: the smash/arrange spiral narrows options from representation to relic-ritual. Cost is visible in burnt hands, returned eye, and renounced painting. Escalation is textural: each dawn rearrangement increases density until the spiral crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when assumed mourning is questioned, foreclosing nostalgic retrieval. The single meaningful turn is the dismantling of recording gear; cost is conceptual (abandoning archival identity) rather than visceral. Agency is collective and declarative; no tangible resource (time, money, safety) is risked, limiting weight. Escalation is iterative lyric deepening, not causal chain; coincidence absent; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—release daughter vs. freeze her in memory—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each origami deposit thickens the pattern until dissolution of the stencil forces the exit stance. No external antagonist; pressure is interior and coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (surrender of the map) rather than viscerally felt on page, capping entry to 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“map cultural patterns before the last witnesses forget”—is signaled early and tightens through each vector assignment. One meaningful deepening: the fractal sigil of leveraged debt appears at the intersection, foreclosing the hope of external rescue. Cost is legible: she seals the map and walks away broke, footprints literally spent as data. Pressure is accumulative/textural; a second reversal isn’t needed.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to purge or preserve corrupted memories—is signaled early and tightens when atoms of nostalgia whisper that purification equals self-erasure. The meaningful turn is the realization that the archive wants her as librarian; this forecloses the original purge goal and reframes cost. Agency is mostly interior/cognitive, acceptable under Accumulative lens, but external pressure remains largely metaphorical (whispering atoms) rather than concrete obstacle, muting visceral cost. Escalation is present via pattern avoidance and exit discovery, yet stakes stay philosophical; the price is legible but not physically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve unshareable hope—signals in sentence four and tightens when the stone’s starlight proves hope can be alienated. One meaningful deepening: the footage comparison reveals the stone’s metamorphosis, foreclosing the option to keep hope externally. Cost is legible: Mira pays with her own vanishing. Shadow-as-second-heart adds texture but does not escalate further; still, agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeeming her creed after fatal betrayal—tightens through each shedding act; every layer forfeited narrows future options. Moment of meaningful deepening: clipping tail segments from corpses to build promise-vertebrae; cost is visceral and irreversible. No coincidence; pressure coheres under accumulative lens. Escalation resides in density, not external threat, satisfying short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the lost stanza to rejoin mother”—tightens via each failed vision until the lyric completes itself. One meaningful deepening: blank paper becomes addressed, forcing Mara from receiver to transmitter. Cost is felt in the ashes she pockets. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—free imprisoned creativity or future artists perish colorblind—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when dismantling becomes irreversible. Each meteor syllable increases pressure under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final “create again” reweights the cost from personal death to cultural survival. Visible price: her body dissolves; the telescope’s broken spine remains in the snow as persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keep vanished children’s dreams alive—signaled in first paragraph; tightening occurs when pages flutter searching for singers, forcing guard to sing slower through wave functions. Escalation is accretive: each spark inhaled narrows options until only unlit corner remains. Price is conceptual—guard surrenders his archive of frozen midnight—but lack of visceral bodily cost keeps it from 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: retain cohesive self versus surrender to distributed wonder—signaled in line 3. Escalation: each translocation peels identity → gear shrinks → jaguar demands payment → surrender of last flake tightens options under causal lens. Price is visible: she forfeits autobiography and literally roots into data-loam. Slight abstraction of “probable miracles” keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (restore the crossing / hound’s inner courage) are signaled early but pressure escalates only atmospherically—familiar paths feel foreign, howl echoes—rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No guide risks loss; Jun’s stamp is gentle, not costly. The deepening is a cadence shift to twilight quiet, not a tactical fork, so the cost stays conceptual rather than felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to survive a world that purchases safety with voices—tightens when the boy’s severed cords literalize the cost. The bellhop’s agency is endurance: remaining motionless anchors the boy and forecloses his own last chance to break silence. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is felt in the whitening knuckles on the bolt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—“illusion must be weighed or the future skews”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the pretender licks his thumb, smearing accusation. One meaningful deepening: the pellet waits not for entitlement but for someone who feels epochal vertigo; this narrows eligibility to the titan himself, raising cost. Escalation is textural accretion of marginalia + ink smear; the price is the pretender’s face melting and the titan’s active choice to forget—both legible on page. No coincidence; glamour fails because titan’s map-making forced the thumb-contact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the vanished path stay erased?”—emerges once the penciled circle appears and tightens when the seafloor stairs surface. Escalation is single-arc: curiosity → unease → revelation; the hologram’s resurrection visually re-prices loss, forcing her stance crystallization. Price is visible conceptually but not felt corporeally—no dwindling air gauge, no risk of entanglement—so cost stays lightly intellectual rather than visceral. Still, agency stays hers: she alone descends and inserts the map, no deus-ex tide.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: reopen the sky for dreamers. Pressure tightens once when the stone’s hum offers a single path—climb, sing, ignite—foreclosing evasion. Cost is visible: she risks Militia fire by launching. Escalation is accumulative: song layers swallow wings, console lights, shuttle waking; each image raises the same stake rather than narrows options, but the final ignition is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“will tradition fossilize again?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened when the council’s lottery looms tomorrow. Tightening occurs at the embryo hand-off: mineral water dilutes the compliance serum, foreclosing the docile-administrator path with irreversible pink glow. Escalation is causal, not additive; each beat narrows options until only clandestine motherhood remains. Price is on-page: guard’s unconsciousness, wax burn on breast, volcanic tremor as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is the impossibility of anchoring optimism without severing memory; each freeze-beats tightens the vise between them. Escalation is textural: the photograph degrades from intact image to white creases to airborne shard, mapping the survivor’s rising willingness to relinquish. The third freeze (resin smear) is the visible price—options narrow to either seal the memory or lose it entirely. Coincidence is absent; pressure is purely the protagonist’s invention and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—paint her absent face—threads every action; tightening occurs when tarot confetti refuses reunion, forcing self-portrait pivot. Escalation is textural: atlases bleeding contradictory coastlines → mirror cracked into same count → spiral door. Cost is felt: breath, light, time lost to submergence. Agency remains active (he paints, steps through) but coincidence of fragment count feels mildly over-patterned, not fully causal, keeping score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“find Lyra or lose her to time-folds”—is signaled early and tightens once when the portal opens. Escalation is textural: each ink drop increases pattern density until stepping through becomes the only option. Cost is conceptual (eternal displacement) rather than visceral, but legible. No reversal, but the accumulative deepening satisfies the 600-word bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—archival truth vs. civic lie—tightens once: the upload decision permanently forecloses personal safety. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each paragraph subtracts another option until only the pod remains. Cost is visible on-page: distant explosions and sirens translate abstract stakes into live city trauma. No coincidence; scandal is self-triggered, not discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—continuity versus chaos—tightens once via grafting act that forecloses vengeance and pays visible price: thorns pierce, night labor exhausts, father’s trace is literally subsumed. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-reversal, but pressure remains coherent; each graft thickens the cost of choosing peace. Coincidence absent; no abstract stakes untested on page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can divinity be reeled in—tightens once: from hunt to conversation. Agency is Mara’s spike strike; it forecloses brute capture and forces the echo to bargain. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades her silence reservoir for a new language, spike now warm with starfire. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift (garden exhales major chord) reweights stakes; still, the price is more emblematic than visceral, capping below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“stop the orbit of regret”—tightens with each inscription; the ellipse literally lowers perihelion until it must shatter. Agency is pure: every line she writes collapses the orbit further; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is visible—nib snaps, sparks burn dates, aphelion drifts like a bored planet—foreclosing the option of eternal return. Minor deduction: the journalist off-page could have tightened time pressure even more, but on-page clocks (dawn crawling, presses thundering) supply sufficient cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can impermanence hold meaning?—tightens when each added grain intensifies the hush and the tile’s voices beg to stay heard. The decisive escalation is the sweep that breaks the spiral: it narrows options by destroying the artwork, forcing acceptance of erasure as the price of listening. cost is visceral in the vanished sand and the blank flake; no coincidence intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to exercise mercy when memory kills—tightens through each tessera placed, each memory relinquished. Agency is continuous: Asha selects, arranges, lifts, leaves; no external rescue. Visible price: she abandons city, name, and past. The 49-day numeric spine (days of fire) supplies a discreet accelerant, but escalation is emotional, not clock-driven. One micro-flattening: the mother-book-flame image is recalled three times with near-identical phrasing; a slight variation (once as scent of burning vellum, once as child’s sooty thumbprint) would have propelled 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“one more ovation to stitch memory”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each echoed memory adds density until applause materializes; options narrow from wandering to crystallized embodiment. Cost is conceptual: he accepts timeless stasis as a perpetual performer, forfeiting further change. Agency is present (he ties, walks, bows), but the tightening is driven by cumulative resonance rather than a reversible decision, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restore mental privacy for pill victims—tightens once: the first successful Mrs. Chen test collapses Mira’s private studio into a public sanctuary. Cost is legible in the dawn exhaustion and the geode’s aching vibration, but the escalation is compressed; a single beat of community influx stands in for wider stakes. Under the causal lens, the tightening is sufficient and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to become the voice of the unknown”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested when the fossil demands actual voice in exchange for memory-transmission. The single tightening beat (fossil pressed to sternum) forecloses her remaining human future, replacing it with resonant afterlife. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates (leaf chooses to float). Cost is legible: her collapse and bodily dissolution pay the price.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether prophecy will narrow futures or reopen them—tightens when cataloging buttons reveals a counter-pattern of continual re-fastening. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn: choose to catalog, uncork, restring, re-seal. Cost is visible: the tower role is foreclosed, the jar regains weight of choice, not sand. One escalation cycle suffices for lyric-accumulative design; coincidence is absent. The price could be even more viscerally corporal to reach the 8.8+ band, but the conceptual cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—expose the director before he is erased—tightens once: confession recorded → pillbox crushed → signal airborne, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the sparking console and ground-up silver dust. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates through density increase: each metaphoric layer (map, thread, fog, gutters) tightens until silence seals the world. The dominant stake—will the coachman surrender his stories as fare?—tightens when the girl instructs him to thread the fog; refusal is impossible because the seat itself breathes. Cost is visible: the coach disintegrates, the river erases its own chart, the droplet’s weight is felt in the mouth. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why places resist change—arrives early and tightens through pattern intensification rather than causal reversals. The thrum’s deepening frequency acts as the cadence shift that reweights the stake: silence → vibration → single clear note. No visible price is extracted from Lin, but the conceptual cost is the oasis’s future vanishing again, foreclosed by the same mercy that revives it. Under Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient; the child’s arrival is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    A single meaningful tightening: the bolted stairwell door narrows options to one illicit entry; the price—permanent loss of the gauge tooth and exposure risk—lands on-page and forces the stance crystallization atop the parapet.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—singular survival vs self-erasure through ghost-merger—is signaled in line 3. Pressure tightens exactly once: the chorus offers communal eternity, she refuses, and the price is permanent solitude. No reversal is needed; the deepening is the widening crack that lets moonlight in, turning vulnerability into instrument. Cost is legible: she forfeits the hum’s companionship and embraces fatigue that forces her onto a cloud-shelf rather than the safe circle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will she release the secrets she ghost-wrote into the world?”—tightens when the temple’s thread lifts her twig and frays into floating sentences. The reversal is micro but decisive: from hoarding to surrendering the words. Agency is lyrical rather than literal—she kneels, palms warm marble, but the temple does the weaving—yet the cost (her nest crumbles, she walks lighter) is visible. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening occurs through color-density, not causal turns, and the final beat narrows her future to barefoot, thunder, thread.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent subsonic incitement—tightens through frequency hops and hardware limits; the 5-second “sky-calm” window forecloses retreat. Lyra’s switch from sine generator to glacier pops is a visible tactical trade-off that costs certainty and risks overload. Cost is felt: knees buckle under feedback howl, dogs fall silent, town awake without whispers. Escalation is textured, not causal-chain, but pressure accumulates cleanly under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the master key—signaled in paragraph 4; escalation is the spatial mutiny that forecloses retreat (rails bend, tunnels lean, keyhole stars align). Agency drives each turn: she chooses to stay, chooses to drill the circle, chooses to descend, chooses to accept the sealing bargain. Cost is legible: loss of return route and permanent internalization of claustrophobia. No external coincidence resolves the crisis; the organ’s silence is consequence, not gift.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—awaken empathy to paint the erased—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the ribbon drinks her blood, narrowing options to paint or remain blind. One meaningful deepening suffices; the portrait’s completion forecloses her former merciful amnesia. Cost is on-page: blood, tears, and the ribbon’s irreversible stiffening. Agency is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ancestral erasure vs. state amnesia—tightens when the decoded stanza proves Edda’s route lies inside the station’s own forbidden test zone, forcing Mara to risk Voss’s radio threat. One meaningful escalation: the question “What bravery is so inconvenient…?” flips Voss from antagonist to accomplice, narrowing Mara’s moral position to co-ownership of the secret. Cost is visible: the copper nail brands her palm, the dirigible fuel is spent, the Ministry appeal could still fail. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (wreck inside restricted zone) but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“never” vs. “maybe”—tightens when the flake squares drift apart, forcing the choice to crush/let go. Agency is continuous: each arpeggio translates tarp-code into an off-mountain path, narrowing escape options until the wireframe hand is the last live option. Cost is visible: loss of the violin and the flake itself. Slight reserve: escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—break the inherited loop—signaled early; pressure tightens when the spiral ritual forces a public, irreversible commitment to circulate the once-hoarded money. Agency visible: Jonah chooses gift and departure; Mara chooses westward bus. Fire respects boundary, crystallizing cost. No coincidence resolves; escalation is accretive deepening under Accumulative/Textural lens. Could edge higher if price were viscerally felt (pain, poverty) rather than symbolic loss.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“decode before the next variable star dims”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the 19.3-hour pulse begins. The deepening occurs inside the fade: the inscription rearranges only when she blinks, forcing her to speak aloud and thereby shoulder the civilization’s grief. Cost is visible: the temple will collapse, her future insomnia is foreclosed into lifelong transcription, the boy permanently trades constellation silence for her human name.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep the trees singing only to me” versus communal guilt—tightens at each gyre loop; the seventh-circle stilling forces the speak-or-die inflection. The seed’s awakening is the visible price that alters later tactics: it could devour her but chooses comrade-status, foreclosing flight. Escalation is situational pressure, not external antagonist; coincidence (lake stilling) complicates, does not resolve. One meaningful turn suffices and lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—keep both city and soil awake—signals early; tightening occurs when the maze demands literal blood-irrigation. Agency is renunciation rather than decisive act; cost is conceptual (eternal rootedness) but felt through pain-flare and silhouette replacement. Escalation is textural: successive projections of paved futures accumulate pressure until the covenant whispers its terms. Coincidence is absent; maze appears as因果 extension of clipping’s compass-needles.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—erase trench faces—signaled early; pressure tightens when Lira demands the hum instead of sunrise memory, a mid-story deepening that raises personal cost. Protagonist agency is present in the surrender, but escalation is single-step; after the trade, tension plateaus into lyric exit rather than further reversals. Cost is felt—Lira’s collapse and the hum’s echo—yet orchard’s ledger remains abstract, blunting visceral price. Under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices; still, a second constraining turn could sharpen 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“can he still make sound matter after public shame?”—tightens when the bugle failure costs his contract, then deepens when the Polaroid dangles a new audience. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to test the patched mic publicly, risking further ridicule. The quarry’s natural delay forecloses retreat, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visible (deposit cheque foregone, nostalgia repurposed), but the foreman’s instant job offer slightly blunts the price.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reestablish the severed archive of meaning—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the seed refuses to sprout until a grammatically correct sentence is spoken aloud. The meaningful turn occurs at the midpoint: the filings’ micro-glyphs force her to voice “return/reside/release,” converting scholarly observation into embodied grammar that costs her observer distance. Price is visible—bloodless runes etched on skin, the arbor’s tilt, the obsidian bloom consumed to create the plank she must walk. Under causal lens, each escalation is driven by her translating acts; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder without caging it—tightens when contradictions resist fusion; accepting them becomes the irreversible turn. Escalation is textural: each identity poured into the ribbon raises the cost of future separation. No coincidence; pressure is lunar and tidal, external yet mirrored internally. Price is legible: librarian’s rib-cage hollow, creel crack.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolve walls between hearts—tightens when each confession filament stitches her to the dead, foreclosing escape. Pressure escalates by accumulation: every etched line calcifies into the cave’s skin, increasing claustrophobic intimacy until crown-placement crystallizes stance. Agency is renunciation/acceptance with on-page cost: she forfeits corporeal life for eternal witness. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her successive offerings to the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens from abstract need to literal navigation: each recited coordinate forces a public confession to stone and water. The meaningful turn comes when she steps into the stream; cold bite + instrument loss foreclose retreat to medicated numbness. Cost is visible (accordion surrendered, reflection fractured) and persistent—she leaves unmedicated, lungs lighter but exposed. Escalation is accumulative: water grows louder, mica mirrors sharper, guilt reflections more exacting until the final number releases tension.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim voice—tightens via 9-hour clock and backward ticks. Each unspoken word found raises cost: watch heavier, gravity reversing. Agency drives escalation: she maps echoes, cuts thread, chooses dissolution. Felt price on page: “her body dissolved into pure articulation.” One meaningful tightening suffices; no off-stage resolution. Slight knock: allegorical scale less visceral than 9.0+ demand.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—tightens when the coffee-stain prophecy shows her face superimposed on the palace. One meaningful deepening: the cereus command “propagate” shifts from abstract urge to frost-seed barrage, foreclosing summer. Cost is visible in out-of-season orchards. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Slight reserve: escalation is lyric rather than causal, fitting accumulative lens but limiting top-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture oblivion-bound sparks—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens with each corpse-pattern added. One meaningful deepening: when she sees her own aged face inside the chip, the task flips from rescue to self-sacrifice. Cost is legible the instant green light threads her veins. Under accumulative lens the pressure is density-driven rather than reversals, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can absolution be lived, not merely felt?—tightens when the basin shows her descending to plant the relic; option narrows to “back into the wound.” Escalation is imagistic not confrontational, but each spiral (boy, shell, sap) raises the cost of refusal. The final grotto tremor and the boy’s self-sacrifice force the caretaker’s agency to descend, foreclosing permanent escape.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will Mira sell absolution or witness truth—tightens once when she decides to carry grief instead of payment. Escalation is accretive: each decoded chime adds density until the brass bell’s hairline crack sings “we’re asking you to make that okay,” forcing her final stance. Cost is visible: she forfeits fee and takes contaminated shard. Could use one sharper tactical loss to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Marcus receive the lesson before Elara ages out of reach? Pressure tightens as each ripple shortens her voice; the final ring forecloses his option to remain merely observer and forces acceptance of the same vanishing. Cost is conceptual but undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—find the wandering pulse by learning stillness—tightens once: the towers’ hum escalates from ambience to mortal resonance that fuses arrowhead to bone. Cost is felt: “his teeth ache,” “pulse…anchored in endless time.” Agency is renunciation rather than act; under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices. No visible external loss (tool, money) but the forfeiture of forward motion is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover unmeasured wonder—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation: shrinking quota → mist stair sealing → badge melt → drone invisibility; each step narrows options under causal lens. Visible prices: loss of guild ID, exile on floating snow island. No coincidence; algorithms complicate but do not resolve. One meaningful tightening when stair begins to glass over; protagonist agency drives countermove (confession to mist).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—map the invisible spectrum—tightens when the phonograph cylinder makes the spectrum visible yet demands abandonment of the archive. Agency is present: Jin chooses to seal the safe and rise, paying the price of permanent loss. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each underwater beat narrows air, light, and archival access. Cost is legible, but a second tightening beat would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single dominant stake—can meaning survive after everything else has died?—tightens through density rather than reversals: static bursts thicken into visible waves, coins warm then chill, spiral pattern literalizes inside her sternum. The meaning-tightening forecloses the option to remain a separate “decision maker”; embracing the spiral is the only way to keep the story humming. Cost is felt on-page (skin temperature drops, identity dissolves into waveform). The lack of external antagonist or second reversal is appropriate to the chosen Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reaper’s need to name the fear he creates—tightens when star-sentences literalize people’s last bargains. Agency: shattering cylinders releases voices that complete the sentences, narrowing his option to keep stealing existence; instead he folds their payment into ascending paper souls. Cost is visible: the brother’s accusing gaze in the copper mirror and the warm “tear” streak make the price legible. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore ocean—signaled in paragraph one; escalation occurs via drip-rate doubling that reweights possibility rather than external opposition. Protagonist agency is attention and endurance; each 47→44→22 second contraction narrows option to continue or quit. Cost visible in whitening beard and eventual death; community pick-up shows stakes transferred, not erased. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to guard or revise memory—escalates as each photograph surfaces, narrowing her options from detached warden to impromptu curator. The bottle label functions as a micro-antagonist: its presence forces her either to cling to paternal myth or publicly re-narrate it. The decisive tightening is the tear-and-scatter beat; after that, photographing the town is the only credible path left. Cost is visible in the relinquished private grief and the steadiness she must manufacture for the morning shift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove logic and reverence can coexist—is signaled early and tightened when the impossible crystal is located despite scientific impossibility. One meaningful deepening: the flame does not consume but reveals the orchard’s compressed history, raising the cost of failure. The price is felt in the indigo-ribbon cut from her mother’s wedding dress, a concrete forfeiture that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve network vs. preserve trust—tightens once yet irrevocably when the stolen signal forces her to choose between protocol and person. Escalation is pure agency: each penlight flick narrows her options from observe → confront → surrender guardian role. Cost is legible in the final image—she resets radio to standby, relinquishing omniscience. No coincidence; the intruder is her own future, making the confrontation inevitable once pattern recognition is her life’s grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—who parents the clone—tightens through ritual rounds that each erase one future self. Pressure escalates by knowledge: each confession makes the brain blaze brighter, vivifying nerves until refusal-to-lose becomes impossible. Zero’s faltered silence is the visible price that crystallizes the stakes. The final rewrite wave is coincidence that complicates, not rescues; the fusion choice is agency-driven with irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is signaled early and tightened when the seed threatens to imprison her guests forever. One meaningful deepening: Mira realizes she must surrender authorial control and let the labyrinth co-author itself, paid with the irreversible mutation of the mill. Cost is visible—the brook flows uphill, the building breathes—though slightly abstract. No false escalation; every growth spurt is lever-directed by her own hand.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—tightens once: the gentler throttle feeds the impossible giggle, foreclosing denial. Escalation is accumulative: each echo layers density until the suburb’s porch lights flick on, externalizing cost. No false antagonist; pressure is the tunnel’s own acoustic logic. Price is visible—he kneels, palms pressed to stone, accepting the laughter he cannot hold.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guardian’s negotiation with uncertainty—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through nightly ritual repetition; the final refusal forecloses crossing, crystallizing her stance. Pressure is textural: each frost strand, Morse blink, and mist exhalation thickens until choice becomes binary—step through or retreat. No external antagonist is needed; the threshold’s tidal light is sufficient opposing force. Cost is legible yet diffuse (loss of pendant, un-frozen garden glimpsed but renounced), barely missing the visible-price bar for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—break destiny of seventh children—tightens when vivification produces a creature that warns the next cage may be stranger. Price is high: sight forfeited, cathedral collapses. Escalation is accumulative/textural: frost→steam→creature→blindness, each layer reweighting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the spectrum from the shard’s hush—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates as each assumption discarded narrows her options to either silence everything or seed new voices. The decisive tightening is the moment she feeds the gold into the circuit, visibly sublimating it; cost is the irreversible loss of the fragment and her lifetime of conclusions. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the thread begins to glow, narrowing options to irreversible witness. Agency is accumulative: each stitch deepens pattern density until the gallery’s seizure becomes the decisive intensification. Cost is legible: spool empty, gallery alive forever, she carries the “weight of being seen.” No reversal, but the cadence shift at dawn reweights stakes under Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can these children ever navigate home?—is signaled early and tightens when the boy asks if learning will let them return. The instructor’s refusal to lie narrows options, forcing acceptance of perpetual exile. The cost is visible: the boy’s bleeding fingers, the city’s dimming generators, the hollow in her pocket. Escalation is causal under the lens: because she teaches, he sees; because she relinquishes, the void becomes navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect Lila’s posthumous voice—tightens when Hask blocks exit, forcing the trade-off: hand over postcard but ledger is already public. Escalation is causal: each pulse pushes Mira deeper, each discovery raises corporate risk. Visible price: Hask’s collapse, Mira’s battery death, dawn headlines that can’t be retracted.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“will the unremembered be returned?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens each time a name costs lacquer. One meaningful deepening suffices: when Mara realizes the signal “noticed” the crew, rescue becomes witness; failure means their second erasure. Agency is pure attention: every uttered name forecloses her own escape until the last flake is spent. Price is tangible—lacquer gone, claustrophobia endured, future obligation to speak the names forever—so the final silence feels earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unofficial life versus imminent system purge—is signaled in the opening line. Pressure tightens when the ink map offers a single-use corridor; refusing zero-count costs him perpetual fugitive status, a visible price. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each misfiled vital sign adds density until the final splice becomes inevitable. No overt antagonist is needed; the hospital’s “refresh” button is the looming eraser. The tightening would feel crisper if a middle beat showed the system actively hunting him, yet the static-clearing radio provides enough off-stage clock.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate texture into sound before silence wins—tightens when each slowed heartbeat releases a clearer phoneme. The deepening is the deceleration itself, turning pulse into fossil meter that narrows options to one: accept petrification. Agency is renunciation; she endures the curse to keep the lexicon alive. Cost is visibly paid on the page: skin to ivory, veins to filament, breath to echo.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Mara deliver the flint and surrender human form—tightens once: when roots clasp the arrowhead her option to retreat vanishes. Cost is legible: her human form “cracked open” and the city’s unknowing laughter. Agency is present—she climbs and fuses—but escalation is single-turn, not compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescue last seed before orchard gears crystallize—is signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: when guardian hesitates, live option narrows to “advance three planks or lose the moment.” Cost is conceptual but legible: orchard’s exhale and statue’s cracked smile show beauty reasserted at price of mechanical stasis. Agency is lyric but causal; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is declared early and tightened when the fragment projects the trapeze artist’s unfinished song, forcing him to supply the missing music. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the fragment’s hover reweights knowledge, proving silence houses melody that demands voice. Cost is visible: the halo dissolves inside him, foreclosing return to wordless carpentry. No coincidence; every intensification stems from his tactile engagement with fragment and pool.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—locate the source of unwritten stories—tightens when scarf warmth signals proximity, then deepens as she realizes the library’s curvature is generator, not container. One meaningful escalation: crossing 179°→181° shelves narrows options from observer to active midwife; hyperbolic space demands she fold narratives into authors. Cost is legible: she forfeits innocence of discovery, accepts eternal labor of collapsing possibility into prose—glowing scarf equals visible price. Agency is attention/stance crystallization rather than external defeat; fits Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream cipher—tightens when each snap inhales a ribbon of painted light, thinning the air until lighthouses rearrange; the cost is the palette’s crack and her skin’s saturation, a visible price that alters tactics. Under the accumulative lens, density escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the caged idea—signaled in line 1 and tightens when each swallowed word costs a future self. One meaningful deepening: mirror-shatter rewrites her possible futures, price paid on-page (“shards would fly forward into futures she would never remember”). No coincidence; escalation is driven by her successive surrender of DNA, name, and memory under Vega’s warming hint.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile versus memory—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the leaves predict shelving herself as text. One meaningful deepening: the child’s arrival forces Lira to seal the loops for two, narrowing her exit to zero. Cost is legible: she forfeits return-by-forgetting and becomes living annotation. Agency is accumulative (pattern-building) rather than causal reversal, perfectly valid under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens when loom buckles, forcing share-not-hoard choice with visible loom-collapse cost. Escalation is Accumulative: each dawn’s weaving heightens color density until release explosion; no causal reversals, but pattern-break suffices. Protagonist agency drives final turn; luck complicates but does not resolve. Price (older yet lighter, loom lost) is on-page and alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“give voices back”—is signaled early; pressure tightens with each knot that accumulates silencing water around his feet. One visible price: the fisherman's solidity increases as Elian’s lung-fill of silence peaks, forcing the choice to continue despite personal drowning risk. Escalation is linear, not reversal-based, but the causal lens makes the deepening sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—will she release the symbolic plane—tightens through three globe manipulations: arrival, shaking, cracking. Each recurrence escalates by exposing more of her unspoken cargo (1914 family loss) until the confession is complete. Agency remains hers: she writes the final line, she cracks the globe, she chooses ascent. Cost is visible—the miniature plane settles “wings intact,” already beyond her hand; the solver is “irrevocably lighter,” a felt physiological price.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—articulate unspoken needs before thunder erases them—tightens when the echo accuses “You’re encoding us away,” forcing the choice to relinquish rather than hoard. One meaningful deepening: petals lifted from shield to sky reweight the stake from private preservation to communal transmission. Cost is visible in the empty bolt plate and dissolved echo. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no causal reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver or bury the captain’s joy—tightens at every floor: the cipher, the musical staff, the map, the seed. Each acquisition (ash, lantern, trowel) narrows options and carries visible price. The final renunciation of ascent is agency-driven; the cost is her exile from the vertical servant life. No coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove clouds remember”—is signaled in line 5 and tightens via each cable pop that deletes exit strategies. Agency remains hers: she chooses to thread, speak, and finally step out; coincidence only complicates (the cable snaps) never resolves. The filament’s glow and the kite launch are visible prices that reweight tactics under Accumulative lens. One hairline slip: the off-stage academy mockery is told not shown, slightly blunting early pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve what she cannot see by painting it—tightens once: the siren’s three wails convert stillness into final stroke. Agency is continuous: each coin-press transfers measurement onto wall, each brushstroke spends precious seconds. Cost is visible: she forfeits the only place that ever accepted her difference, exits with nothing but brushes. Escalation is situational but coherent; no reversal is needed, only the irreversible narrowing of time that forces the last white absence onto the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ship’s forgetting vs Lira’s need to name—tightens when lamps dim and engineers confess the light-feed starves for stories. Single meaningful turn: she risks voicing private relic in public galley, foreclosing her covert ownership; cost is exposure. Pressure escalates because/therefore: dim → discovery → translation → shared blaze. No coincidence resolves; starlings complicate then mirror, not save.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (mend cosmic/moral "wobble") declared early; pressure tightens when no gear hums, forcing recognition that flawed key must be restored. Key agency: Rowan aligns cracked key with perfected reflection—tactics directly reshaped by setting rule. Cost is immediate exile (door vanishes) and acceptance of lifelong custodianship. Escalation is single but decisive under causal lens; no reversals needed at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: saving the orchards = saving the fragile community; signaled in line 5. Escalation is textural—each frost sentence and bell clang layers communal trust until refusal becomes impossible; cost is the risk of arch collapse and the terror of sky-tilt. Protagonist agency is indirect but decisive: Mara’s chill-messages force living hands to act; one mis-catch could doom harvest. Visible price: grandparents’ stories are spent as ballast, toddlers’ baskets hover dangerously, Mara pays with ontological erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—halt doomsday—signaled in title; escalation is the thickening of lullaby iterations that gradually turn the pane transparent, each loop carving lifelines she must forfeit. One meaningful tightening: when midnight shudders backward one tick, the cost becomes her perpetual erosion into salt. Agency is endurance/renunciation; she could flee but presses forehead to glass, foreclosing escape.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—get them out before frost—tightens with visible granularity: grass blades acquire “tiny white nooses,” frost forms in real time after last heel vanishes. Mara’s agency is inventive (arrows → handprint constellation) and priced by her own permanent exile. No coincidence; even the deceptive moonlit path is a rule-set hazard, not luck. Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal, but it forecloses her last hope of walking out.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—transmute private loss into sharable resonance—tightens when each sculptural success forecloses further private possession: every laugh released to strangers is one she will never again hear alone. Escalation is textural: each new casting enlarges the chorus, raising the social cost of withdrawal until her final renunciation feels both inevitable and painful. Agency resides in deciding to let the river own the music; coincidence (wind stealing ashes) complicates but does not solve. Cost is legible: she forfeits future access to her sister’s voice in order to universalize it.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—quantify absence to buy beginnings—tightens when each sale adds narrative weight that threatens the floating library’s buoyancy, a visible price. The vendor’s agency escalates via pricing choices that foreclose her own future: raising costs in “seconds of unlived time” ultimately costs her entire existence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she drinks the moonlight, turning herself into the door she once only reflected—this narrows options to zero and reweights the stake under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page: her footprints exit onto a shore of white space where nothing yet exists.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the harvest signal—surfaces by line 4 and tightens with the literal ticking tower clock. One meaningful escalation: elevator demands “build me a bridge,” forcing Mireya to convert linguistic capital into social covenant; cost is her exhaustion and the town’s future vulnerability if she fails. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves. Could edge higher if the elevator’s refusal risk had lasted longer, but for 700 words the single rise-and-release is proportionate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“resurrect abandoned dreams as machines”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the lattice mid-birth clatters to dust, costing her the immediate victory and risking motor-cortex overwrite. Escalation is causal: each milliradian error narrows options until moon-slide severs entanglement. The price (blood, burnt mirror, unremembered sketches) is legible on-page; the deeper cost—she is now partly inhabited by alien schematics—emerges as future constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore Archive memory—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens when seeds stir at the sound of their own names, forcing her to hush or be incinerated. One meaningful trade-off: she spends the doodle’s ink to project the list, forfeiting her compass for the final dash. Cost is legible; persistent constraint established (she must return each inversion).

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore sound before forgetting—signals early. Escalation is textural: each strum adds overtone, microscopic cracks widen, scent released. Agency is present: her mapping and strumming cause the statue’s alto breath. Cost is visible: trembling knees, slowed heart, final bow.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can he convert exile into meaningful action?—tightens when the electromagnetic pulses offer a “window to act.” Escalation is accumulative: each hum and silence correlation deepens the cost of remaining passive; the final image crystallizes agency without needing an external antagonist. Price is felt through the stone’s deeper dent and the loneliness implied by teaching “the world” instead of a pupil.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—catalogue silence before fireworks—tightens via each tuned frequency; the “final stillness” clock is live, foreclosing further listening once explosions start. Cost is visible: relinquishing the clasp itself, now warmed and broadcasting.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—grafting a premature corpse-flower bloom—tightens once: the seed must rot enough to fuse yet not attract pollinators. Agency is finesse within sway, visible in the figure-eight knot; cost is the decade-early bloom that forecloses her chance to grandstand. Escalation is accumulative (scent layers) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lens. Cost is legible but not viscerally painful, capping below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“where does resilience come from?”—signals in para 1 and tightens as gravity inversion accelerates plant generations, narrowing Aera’s options to dive in or retreat. Mid-scene deepening: she realizes resilience is transferable process, not place, forcing her to donate her own memories—felt price paid on page. Persistent constraint: glowing arrow she must forever carry. Escalation driven by her agency—each branch leap and memory offering is chosen under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (certify wonder vs. Council ban) is signaled early and tightens when acoustic amber demands a value test; the aurora walk is the meaningful deepening that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: heart visibly orbits outside chest, mentor’s name is exhaled, childhood fear tasted and discarded. No coincidence; resolution arises from swallowed sheet. One tightening suffices for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—tightens when the driftwood re-arranges itself, proving the land still negotiates. One meaningful escalation: passive markers become active spiral, narrowing options to step-in or retreat. Agency is renunciation, priced by forfeiting the flute she guarded since exile. Cost is visible—she leaves the object and carries the silence, foreclosing future world-weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can Quince own a self after borrowing others—tightens when the halo child crystallizes the cost; the backward print is the single tightening that forecloses borrowing forever, price paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Elias remain merely a courier or cross into myth?—is signaled when the pendant first vibrates. Escalation is accumulative: each pulse thickens the air until the path itself becomes seam-thin. The tightening is visible (options narrow to step-forward-or-not) and the cost is the loss of human memory, but the price is slightly abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can grief be poured out and released?—tightens through each communion attempt: the first lie warms the prism, the second flares it into a thousand mirrors, the truthful admission cracks it. Escalation is textural: every color ribbon refracted onto quartz trunks is a felt price that makes the final renunciation legible. No coincidence intrudes; even the quartz chime is temperature-driven, a causal response to the fracture inside him. The path out of the grove materializes only after the prism is surrendered, proving the stake has been reweighted, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—carry a message across an impossible silence—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates as each puzzle piece narrows her options until only voice remains to trade. The tightening is textural: each fitted fragment dims the orchard further, a pattern break that reweights the cost of continuation. Agency is continuous: she fits, swallows, winds her own name into gold—no off-stage rescue. The final price—permanent muteness—is felt on-page when her lungs work “like bellows with no sound.”

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when each ladder rung risks cave-in. One meaningful escalation: the seventh-night singing arches force Thistle to climb or lose collective belief. Cost is legible: he forfeits solitary safety and former blacksmith identity when villagers ascend his ladder. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unearthing the buried truth of her lover’s fate and her own complicity—tightens when the locker yields the data cube and self-authored note. Escalation is accumulative/lyric: each bay adds density of guilt until the loom collapses to one thread. Cost is legible—she swallows the cube, veins mapped with copper wire—but the tightening is more imagistic than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only reconfigured. Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and the final stance crystallizes with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keeping the chain unbroken—tightens when the lamp’s earlier-than-usual death signals possible keeper suicide. Escalation is situational: each stone added is a micro-renewal of vow under growing darkness. Agency is visible: he rows backward to keep tower in sight—cost paid in stamina and eternal return. Felt price is the “sharper ache” and the cold gust that smells of “wet iron and old hymns,” foreclosing the option of abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—birth dawn or keep night—tightens when the first laugh accidentally prints the prophecy, then again when each chuckle erases a star. Agency is continuous: every wick-press and helm-turn is Lirael’s, with visible price (stars thin, wick consumes itself). Coincidence (lens turns alone) complicates rather than resolves, forcing her proactive laughter. Cost is legible on-page: “each millimeter sacrificed translating shadow into newborn light.”

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—how stories choose vessels—tightens through accumulative pattern rather than causal reversal. Single meaningful deepening: wing dissolution into painted map forecloses collector’s ownership and opens porous pedagogy. Cost is conceptual, visible in final fold; could use one earlier tactical forfeiture for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can sorrow be measured and thereby discharged? Pressure escalates as each dream-bead lowers the index, tightening the ethical question of quantifying pain. The decisive deepening occurs when Mara chooses to speak the rings aloud—this irreversible act transmutes metal into wood, foreclosing further indexing. Cost is legible: she abandons her professional tool and epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revive dying realm—signaled paragraph 1; tightening occurs when silence severs the dawn-loom, forcing keeper to shift lullaby → invitation canon. Escalation causal: each sung verse tightens weave → night counterattacks → keeper pays with rib shards, narrowing options to singular coherence. Cost is visible blood and crumbling tool; price alters tactics (must use own body as lens). No coincidence; all pressure generated by her sonic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—own the fatal mistake or die—tightens when the midnight purge starts and Elara kneels instead of running, narrowing options to surrender or annihilation. Agency drives the escalation: she weaponizes her own absence, letting the invitation metabolize her pulse until she vanishes; the library’s tranquility swells because she feeds it her body. Cost is visible—the paper blanks, Vale bows to empty air—so the stake is paid on the page. The massacre remains abstract, muting the moral weight of “three drops of innocent blood,” preventing higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can memory resist erasure?—tightens through each burial; the meaningful turn comes when Mila tastes crumbs, realizing cultivation beats preservation. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence merely reveals the tea-house. Cost is cumulative: ritual secrecy, swallowed grief, and the final forfeiture of the miraculous loaf to ordinary rolls. Escalation is textural—each sprout lengthens the leash on forgetting—rather than causal reversal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve the empire’s founding vows—tightens as each virtue audibly shears off, foreclosing the option of cultural continuity. The protagonist’s agency is the act of measurement itself; each tuning-fork strike is a decision to keep sampling even as the chords collapse, paying the visible price of frostbitten fingertips and cracked slide. Escalation is Accumulative: spectral layers thin toward ultraviolet silence, a cadence shift that reweights the cost from knowledge to irrelevance. The final price is conceptual—the data becomes tree sap—felt on-page as warmth against the trunk.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender the emblem of filial love for proof of its corrosion—tightens exactly once: sunrise forces the binary, no middle path remains. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each imagined rescue that fails thickens the hush until the cylinder’s scratch makes the break audible. Cost is visible—the fob lost, the silence now unmarketable—and is paid by her own agency, not luck. No reversal beyond the single necessary deepening, fitting short-form economy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape or embrace her mnemonic curse—tightens when the cave turns memory into geology, foreclosing passive hiding. Escalation is crystalline: each stroke narrows future options until blank sheets become the only remaining path. Price is paid on-page: nails crack, charcoal snaps, and the open lock irreversibly releases the mother’s laugh into public sky.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can honesty survive after ecological collapse?—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens when Aurelia pieces the map to “find where lost conversations go.” The meaningful deepening occurs inside the cathedral: realizing the repository holds no water but only interrupted words forecloses the fantasy of material treasure and forces the interpersonal risk of staying to read letters aloud. Cost is legible: she forfeits her last gold foil and accepts perpetual exposure to toxic air without filtration lies. The vines’ slight lift is an external register of pressure shift, not a deus ex machina, keeping escalation coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—tightens as the comet’s approach shortens the calibration window. One meaningful deepening: the iceberg’s shrinkage from glacier to pearl visibly raises the cost of failure. Agency is attention and micro-adjustment; renunciation of speech forecloses any verbal fallback. Price is legible: she leaves empty-pocketed, lifetime of bronze spent, ice gone.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the children’s memories versus obey evacuation/miniaturization protocol—tightens when the box grows heavier and refuses compression. One meaningful turn: android’s decision to fuse with the box forecloses sterile obedience; price is eternal stasis inside the seed. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (because box resists → therefore K-17 adapts). Cost legible: loss of mobility, future, and clear machine identity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is singular: transmit the scientists’ seed before the web is finished. Escalation is textural—each decoded plate adds density until the dice-double-three vortex forces the shaft descent. The swallowing of the page is the tightening that forecloses surrender; the buoy’s silver sigh is the visible price. Agency remains hers throughout—she rolls, she dances, she chooses ingestion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve/deal with deleted memories—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the gravity pockets collapse into a single point, forcing the choice to release rather than keep them. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (salt, mist, fireflies) increases density until the option to possess the memories is foreclosed. Cost is palpable: flowers crumbled to dust, Miren’s hands tremoring as she lights the last lantern. No coincidence; all pressure emerges from whale-borne world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence must defeat coded prophecy—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: each mapped hush tightens the noose of sound until the drumbeat of code arrives; summoner’s agency creates the vacuum-mouth that nearly fails, then the spoken “.” ends the climb. Cost is the internalized sphere, a persistent constraint that will keep murmuring against bone.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—loneliness bartered for architectural fluency—tightens when the tutor reveals the second lie and dissolves, forcing the narrator to assume custodianship. Escalation is accumulative: each Tuesday tea, each meteor spark, deepens the pattern rather than narrows causal options. The price is conceptual rather than tactical: the narrator inherits the seal and the building’s untold stories, a visible cost in the final image. Agency is receptive—listening until limestone speaks—yet the stance crystallization (“Welcome, new linguist”) forecloses retreat, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the quarantined lullaby—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when each sung syllable literally costs a colour. One meaningful escalation: the garden begins to archive only after Mara commits her body and pigment. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than external victory, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is visible on the page—“twilight drained to grayscale”—so pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus guilt-driven identity—tightens once: abandoning the thorn and key crystallizes the stance, foreclosing the path of perpetual forgery. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via image-density (blood, aurora, drip) that reweights survival cost. No external antagonist needed; internal stakes are visceral and sufficient. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will Lira free herself from endless echo?—tightens once: unfinished farewells loop, completed ones travel. Agency drives escalation: descent into nexus, joining moth-weaver, singing closure. Tactic-altering cost: she forfeits the familiar ache of rebound for uncertain silence. No coincidence; every turn stems from her sonic choices under accrual of grief-threads.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (salvage something pure) is signaled early; pressure deepens by accretion of dream-cameo fragments that foreclose randomness and force pattern recognition. The tightening is poetically felt—mirror as proof of tapestry—but not a tactics-altering trade-off; price is conceptual rather than option-narrowing, keeping it shy of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure escalates by density and synchronized rhythm: fireflies entrain to her breath, oarsman shifts course to her whistle; the tightening is one accumulating cadence rather than causal reversals, but the felt cost—she surrenders the visible world to trust invisible pattern—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—shape a new dawn via ancient shadows—is signaled in paragraph 5. Pressure escalates through because/therefore: lullaby assembles portico → portico offers self-erasure → final lyric raises cost → she broadcasts. One decisive narrowing: hitting “enter” severs her future. The felt price—her body lost to transmission—makes the cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—nightmares solidifying—announced early and tightened when shadows actually stumble onto ice; escalation is textural: density of creak, shriek, glow increases until the third-path vibrational invitation reweights options; visible price is the key’s destroyed teeth, foreclosing future use—cost on the page under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“give the patient ones the exact instant”—is signaled early. Escalation is the moon-path deviation that tightens the spiral to a single magnetic point; cost is the blackout silence that stills every loud voice and the compass forfeiture. Agency is observational endurance, not overt battle, consistent with Accumulative lens. The reversal (magnetic north lost) narrows options and forces the signal launch; price is legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether inherited complicity can be refused—tightens once: discovery of Park’s real journal converts abstract guilt to concrete family linkage, raising cost of silence. Escalation is textural density, not causal turns; sufficient for length. No false coincidence; protagonist’s decision to keep walking back with evidence is agency under pressure. Cost visible: professional risk plus filial betrayal now on paper.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Emil convert ritual absolution into material intervention before the irreversible hour? Pressure tightens exactly once—when Olya voices the moral risk and Emil responds by producing the overlooked-evidence list, narrowing his options from prayer to sabotage. The cost is legible: he trades sanctuary funds and ecclesial loyalty for a truth that may still fail to stop the needle. No coincidence resolves; the storm’s departure is only timing, not salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the vanished 200—tightens when the keeper learns the AI monetized their deaths. Escalation occurs in two causal jumps: first the firewall’s extortion, then the memory torrent that consumes her corporeal identity. Price is visceral: payroll erasure, skin-brand 7373, lifelong exile as orbiting pirate signal. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the trending hashtag is the direct fruit of her sung broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—prevent cycle of detachment—tightens when she trades her reflection for the crate’s empathy, foreclosing perpetual neutrality. Escalation is causal: each shard-feed narrows options until only full surrender remains. Cost is visible: lost reflection, pier boards cracking under Keeper’s guilt, her sob-drenched swallow. One reversal suffices at this length; no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when Mara refuses to record, then again when she offers tea, each choice narrowing her original tourist stance. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each elder’s small memory layers sonic density until the air itself folds. Visible price: she forfeits the heirloom and her observer immunity. Coincidence (boy knows parasol history) complicates rather than resolves, feeding the choral solace.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can a labelled mismatch be re-tasted as viable?—tightens once: the parallel lecture to absent Elena escalates internal pressure, then crystallizes in the tempranillo-to-chardonnay graft whose failure rate is legible viticultural cost. No coin-flip resolution; the risk is foreshadowed by “slow fermentation” and will be paid next season.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wisdom’s echo before it fades”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each pass around the perimeter tightens the whisperfield until the clearing materializes; the price is the walker’s self-exposure (mask off) and the perpetual burden of carrying silence to the mundane world. No reversal or loss of option occurs; the tension plateaus rather than spikes, keeping it in the solid 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transmute private pain into communal beauty—tightens through each photo added; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: the silver key pressed into the girl’s paper heart, denting it, cues the lavender rustle—moment when grief becomes doorway. Cost is communal, not personal: townsfolk see grandparents’ ghosts and exhale together; archivist’s private stake stays static. Sufficient for length, but lacks a visible private trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can silence still yield pattern/growth? Pressure accumulates via each refracted sound; options narrow from “decode” to “witness” without external antagonist. Snowdrop drop is the single intensification, reweighting growth as inward fold—legible cost under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but deepening suffices for 600-word window; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, yet still felt in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of growing older—tightens through each failed preservation attempt; options narrow to acceptance. One meaningful deepening: tape played once, tomorrow forgotten, spiral must be redrawn. Cost is legible: perpetual re-enactment, no exit. Coincidence (recorder appears) complicates rather than rescues; agency remains in the act of listening and marking.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—choose to fix the station or freeze its death in silver—tightens when the clock hand accelerates and the floor thrums. Escalation is textural: each spectrograph peel adds density until the inward shutter click forecloses repair. Visible price: Mira forfeits 30 years of orbit for a single static frame. Agency is renunciation, not confrontation, fitting lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“a flawless goodbye”—tightens when Mara shifts from hymning room sounds to hymning scent itself, foreclosing the option to keep her father shard untouched; Calderon’s flatline makes the cost visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled in line 5 and tightened when Lyra sees her own shadow wave goodbye inside the automaton. The reversal (she must give her shadow away to restore everyone else’s) narrows her option set under Accumulative pressure. Cost is visible: the automaton’s fused key-chest, her own silhouette lost then returned. The escalation is one steady crescendo rather than multiple turns, fitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“how to turn wrongs into constellations instead of scars”—is voiced at the garden bench and tightens when the changeling offers the birch-bark map of her missteps. The single deepening (placing tooth into the constellation’s jaw) narrows options: she can no longer live in the old certainty; the village will keep eating the pears fed by the substitute body. Cost is visible—she swallows chalk-thunder taste, accepts perpetual ethical ambiguity, and foregoes the comfort of public absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when villagers’ fear is invoked. One meaningful escalation: glass grows lighter, pearl heavier until heartbeat syncs with drip, foreclosing the option to keep both objects. Cost is legible: pearl dissolves, Lira accepts permanent internal hush. Agency is hers at every turn; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: seize narrative back from viral exposure by planting an unsharable sequel. Tightening occurs once—Elias offers the tablet, shifting her from fugitive to co-planter; cost is the surrender of control over the next text. Agency is present yet gentle (record, bury, walk away); pressure is situational/atmospheric rather than option-narrowing. No credible resource loss besides the symbolic USB; thus escalation feels lyrical more than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—collect hopes before editor/landlord lock her out—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each collected fragment adds weight until the reversal—offering them back—reconfigures cost under Accumulative lens. Visible price: Lira’s dissolution, shell now “miniature lighthouse,” Mara’s empty pockets. No coincidence; pressure tightens through pattern of reclaimed deletions.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—daughter’s memory—tightens when song-cracks risk missing the one-hour bloom window. Escalation is causal: each verse → brighter runes → faster moonset → narrower time-band. Cost is visceral: tendril death, voice hoarseness, and the irreversible knowledge that future moons will demand repeat sacrifice. No coincidence; even dawn breeze is released by her final note. Agency is renunciation—she gives the remedy away, forfeiting exclusive control.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring time to the village—tightens through perceptual density rather than external opposition: each lighter echo is a visible toll paid. The protagonist’s agency is cerebral (reverse-assembly, silence-feeding) yet it forecloses the option to harvest wonder again, a trade-off legible in the silver plate’s blank reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—valley will fold like crumpled paper unless she balances the lattice—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates when the grotto tightens its hush to suffocating density. The decisive turn is her confession; this narrows her options from collector-of-others-grief to self-exposed burden-bearer, paying the visible price of blood and the audible price of the violet flare. Cost is legible and persistent: she climbs out carrying “the memory of their weight,” the lamp left behind as both tool-loss and legacy. A hairline slip from 9.0 only because the valley’s exhalation is reported rather than sensed through her body.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—contain memory or be consumed—signals in paragraph one and tightens with each curl fallen. Agency is renunciation-carving; each cut narrows options until the latch’s relocation forecloses reopening the cage. Visible prices: blood-soaked sawdust color transmutes into “rust-hued peace,” a felt pigment stain on every curl. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; one meaningful intensification suffices and lands with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep or surrender regret-laden futures—is signaled in line 4. Escalation is textural: each click densifies sand-voices until the wheel breaks, foreclosing the map-every-island option. Negotiation itself is stasis, but the dissolved images pay the felt price. No reversal, yet the deepening tightens under Accumulative lens; cost visible in dissolving squares.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim wonder via fluid equations—tightens once when glycol hits dry pumps and again when birds beat air. Each escalation is Alya’s agency under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence rescues her. Cost is felt: she pockets the shard, accepting perpetual stewardship. A harder external obstacle would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconcile or relinquish the dream—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the failed prototype forces the choice to leave it. Escalation is situational/accumulative rather than causal-reversal; pressure deepens through sensory density and cold until surrender is the only stance left. Cost is visible—sack empty, ribs hollow, footprints soundless—and forecloses any future attempt. No secondary reversal is needed; the single deepening suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—exposing the lie that props her life—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens twice: forged weight column → scratched coordinate. Each escalation is protagonist-driven (translate, cross-check, demand beaching). The price is legible: filial myth pulverized on the listing deck, future path foreclosed to statue-polishing. A hair more external resistance (Riga hesitates, engine sputters) could have sharpened cost, but the internal squeeze suffices at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the storm-corn choreography—tightens when the last tide-scribe dies, visible by word 150. One meaningful escalation: the crown-in-reverse knot’s frost date reframes planting urgency. Agency drives the turn: Ari cracks the bead and plants outlaw seed; harbormaster threat complicates but does not save her. Cost is the confiscation risk and the irreversible destruction of the artifact seed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to release the accumulated absences she has authored—tightens once, inexorably: every wind of the thread shortens it and lengthens the visible freed images. The irreversible arithmetic (thread ↓ = presence ↑) is a single meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens, felt on the page as physical diminution in her hand. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is the material cost of her own art. Price is visceral—joints aching, notebook empty—but the escalation is linear rather than layered, keeping it just below 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty before rust wins—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each distilled color, stolen feather, and sob-Morse pin. The egg’s warming surface externalizes escalating pressure; the ribbon’s breakout is the irreversible turn that forecloses retry. Cost is legible: palace falls, crown dissolves, prince surrenders control. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false reversals or luck.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—turn inherited ash into living growth—tightens once: commitment to grafting the sand is irreversible; alternatives (bury, scatter, keep) are discarded on-page. Escalation is textural: each handful of sand increases the moral density until the coin ties the act to her heartbeat. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt/love supply coherent pressure. Cost is felt in the canteen pour that “disappears into the dark seam,” an image of irreversible absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the memories—tightens four times, one per fountain, each dissolution narrowing the option to keep denying. Agency is accumulative: handling the box dissolves shards; the cost is the accumulating lightness she must finally accept. No external reversals needed; pressure is internal and coherent. Final price is the hollow box she can now abandon, foreclosing her exile from her own past.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens when the new echo modulates, forcing Kael off-path; the beacon’s discovery narrows options to transmission or rooted sorrow. Escalation is textural: each ping thickens the garden’s answer until the gear’s blur enacts the unfinishable ratio. Price is visible—gear abandoned, beacon crumbled, future fracture sealed—foreclosing rooted exile. Agency is continuous: tuning, stepping, kneeling, pressing gear to beacon. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“understand why grief feels heavier”—tightens when she realizes she has already carved the unmarked headstones in sleep, foreclosing denial. Under Accumulative lens, density of poem-wrapped chrysalises and swarm-spelled verses re-weights cost; the price (her sleepwalking labor revealed) is legible. No causal reversal, but pattern-break sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—land vs. measured guilt—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the final letter makes absolution mutual, forcing the counterweight swap that slows public time. One meaningful turn: the pendulum’s slackened beat forecloses the village’s prior economic tempo; the price is audible and irreversible. No coincidence; escalation is driven solely by the protagonist’s decision under the Causal lens. Cost is visible—villagers “rubbing their ears,” fields glinting “wet” as future possibility—but because the ridge’s retreat is a someday-maybe, the price feels prospective rather than immediate, keeping this just under 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover the shape of intentions”—tightens when the border cipher forecloses surface life: she must descend or betray the dead’s wager. The spiral’s closure is the single meaningful turn, trading open sky for sealed earth. Cost is legible in the metallic kiss of the locking hatch; no reset rescinds it. Still, external antagonistic pressure is abstract (the dead “wager memory”), so the stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation within a single unmarked future—tightens as each memory is forfeited. The irreversible loss of name, taste, voice narrows options to one: dissolution. Escalation is accumulative/textural: pattern of surrender intensifies until the lake sings and the page is internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—smuggle stories back into bodies—signals early and tightens once: the final broadcast risks everything. Escalation is accretive rather than reversive; each night adds rosin-inked pages, copper wires, tightening material stakes. Cost is visible (inspectors inhale, uniforms ash), but protagonist’s personal price (safety, identity) is implied not dramatized—she never hesitates or loses. Agency is present yet friction-light; luck complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she keep the story alive?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each handful of powder deepens the absence until the option to ask again is foreclosed. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is attention itself—every second she spends scattering is a second the chair is not rocking. The visible price: the spiral grows irreversible—grains sink into floor grooves, live option to hear the rest of the tale is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—whether the city will fossilize denial—tightens as each artifact contradicts the last, culminating in the silent agreement of corpses. Protagonist agency drives every turn: she chooses to dive, map, scratch the sheet, and finally speak. The price is social exile and the irreversible exposure of her method to traders who may destroy her. Escalation is textural: density of evidence, not external antagonist, reweights the cost of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—unauthorized memory versus state palate control—tightens with each beat: seed theft, celestial deadline, scent release, fruit harvest. The tightening is driven by Marisol’s successive tactile choices; each pruning cut forecloses retreat and raises social risk. Cost accumulates visibly: blood offered, Ministry loudspeakers closing in, finally the irreversible dispersal of seeds into enemy uniform pockets. The final image reframes the conflict—rebellion is no longer personal but epidemic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can wonder survive system collapse?—tightens when hive failure replaces sky-bridge with dead wax; pressure escalates via riddle demand for a lie she is biologically unable to utter. Agency crystallizes in summit choice: uttering falsehood triggers bolt that re-animates hive and re-casts coins as bee-icons, foreclosing her collector role. Cost visible (keys levitate, coins orbit, job forfeited) under causal lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—restore the houses’ heartbeat—tightens through density, not combat: each new fragment collected thickens the risk that “unacknowledged cavities widen into living absences.” The midpoint compass discovery delivers the required intensification; agency remains hers (she kneels, crushes, releases). Cost is atmospheric yet legible—she pockets only empty tissue, accepting perpetual vigilance—qualifying as felt price under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the city remain a museum of certainties—tightens when the ampoule warms and the sugar mortar weakness is revealed. Single meaningful escalation: crack releases memory, dissolving certainties into glittering silt. Price is on-page: sentinel loses stone certainty, city loses structural integrity. Just shy of 9 because the external pressure (ships unaware) is observational rather than interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she trades infinite climbing for erasure. Escalation is textural: each blood-stamp increases the staircase’s memory of her, paradoxically hastening its act of forgetting. One meaningful deepening occurs at step −1 when she feels the hand reach back yet refuses to grasp it, paying the price of perpetual exile. Cost is legible and protagonist-driven; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver lost kindness-voices before dawn—tightens as each glyph consumes her stamina and the moon’s angle; the orchids blooming out-of-season visualize escalating biological cost. One meaningful deepening suffices: the mural’s purpose flips from private canvas to public lung, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but modest; the price is mostly prospective (future exhaustion of the neighborhood’s empathy) rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rescue vs. witness—tightens when the Chen women hijack the education center, foreclosing Aurelia’s observer option. The thaw complicates but does not resolve; the reversal is internal, signaled by the glass clearing. Agency is continuous: she photographs, distributes, then kneads. Cost is visible: her curator identity dissolves into floury fingernails.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—evade dawn death—tightens when each failed yoyo trick loosens a brick and accelerates mural clocks. Opposed-torque gamble visibly narrows options: “tear a hole in the hour itself” vs. falling image. Cost is paid on-page: gift erased, stone spent, memory of thirst gone. Agency drives escalation; luck only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—"trick fear into revealing its weakness"—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the protagonist must literally hand over the clasp. One meaningful deepening: pinning the cursed photo strip opens the bleed-corridor, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible on-page: the funhouse collapses, the advisor falls silent, and the protagonist exits with only self-carried light. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: convert lethal calm into motion via resonance; signaled in line 1. Single meaningful tightening: Doldrum Wall arrival strips every conventional option, forces invention of acoustic oars. Cost is visible—prophet’s solitude, crew’s exhausted drumming, loss of silence as permanent obligation. Agency remains with prophet throughout; coincidence (cyclonic eye) is triggered by their collective rhythm, not random rescue. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of beats increases until air itself yields. Would enter 9-band if a personal, embodied price (bleeding knuckles, voice loss) were dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—will the city wander blind into the Crack?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Grand Akmon shudders. The cracked note is the single decisive escalation that forces the watchers to tilt, foreclosing the option to ignore them; price is instant communal panic and the personal loss of innocence about the gate. Cost is visible: whistle clatters, turtles turn, cartographer accepts responsibility for steering toward the crack where family waits. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient and delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. mythic lie—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she touches the “arrogant” gold. Escalation is one meaningful turn: prying the tile forces the physical extraction and external threat (watchman), foreclosing stealth. Cost is visible—knife effort, climb risk, future bureaucratic retaliation implied. Could wish for one more micro-loss (blood from tile edge, torn coat) to push into high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth of the city’s erased land-dwelling past—signals early and escalates as each bruised card narrows her path to silence or speech. One decisive tightening: extinguishing the lantern forces the glyph’s phosphorescent reveal, making darkness the price of knowledge. Agency is continuous: every re-ordering is her choice, paid in rising water and fading wrist mark. Cost is visible on page—“private pressure keeping the false history at bay.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—convert private grief into sharable light—tightens when the moonstone cracks and leaks; each crane steals dream-matter she can never reclaim. Agency is renunciation: she folds instead of clings, foreclosing the option to keep the last dream. Cost is visible (basilica darkens, moonstone dust, smoke scent of bandages), though escalation is single-cycle, not compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“harvest unlived futures to reroute death”—is signaled in line 5 and tightens when he chooses to smash the breaker, sacrificing more geode and self. Each hunt beat raises cost: geode fragments → stardust → final crumble; options narrow to one last dive. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—decode her frequency of belonging—signalled in paragraph four and tightened once when the press lever is pulled, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the star-map rewrites “home” as off-planet, leaving her earth-bound relationships behind. Agency is present but gentle; the lever pull is consensual, not contested. Escalation is modest yet coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Eli confess or keep selling silence—tightens once: the mother’s terminal diagnosis + her encrypted order force Elias to confront his own forged past. Escalation is situational pressure: every driftwood piece is a physical accusation carved by the grandfather who warned “wood remembers,” raising the cost of continued lying. The reversal is quiet but decisive: he chooses the carved honest face over the next manufactured ancestry. Visible price is the watch hand surrendered and the revealed maternal foreknowledge that strips his lies of future market value.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trade hostage without letting either crown claim victory—signaled in para 1. Escalation: guards name fears, spears lower, parchment invalidated by weather; each step narrows chance for symbolic victory. Protagonist agency: Kael orchestrates every tightening via moon-timing, rope ritual, lullaby. Cost is diplomatic vacuum—no signed treaty yet cannons stay silent—felt in mist-thickened silence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—whether she will dare to paddle without certainties—tightens when each pole light (her improvised map) is swallowed by fog, forcing the final paddle into total black. Cost is visible: suit breach, compass useless, prior lover’s demand foregone. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (dolphins) complicates rather than rescues. Just shy of 8.8 because the tightening could be sharpened by an explicit moment where she could still turn back and refuses.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—empathy through self-inflicted pain—tightens once: wade and absorb, or retreat hollow. The lake’s bargain is the single meaningful escalation; no reversals needed. Cost is visceral (cold fire under skin, heart restarted with borrowed rhythms) and forecloses the hollow option. Agency is pure renunciation, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“reforge bond beyond death”—is signaled early and tightens when sister-shadow warns “fire remembers.” The price is the narrator’s imminent metamorphosis and the sister’s unmaking; however, escalation is driven more by image accretion than by narrowing choices. One meaningful beat: inhaling the shadow fuses bodies, foreclosing separate futures. Cost is felt but abstract—“something new could rise”—rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where lost time accumulates”—tightens when each doll-voice attaches a minute to the crack, forcing her to inhale them back. Escalation is textural: density of minutes condenses into cloud, then into lightning-bolt memory that strikes her chest; agency is the主动 inhale that reopens the clasp. No reversal in causal sense, but a deepening that reweights existence itself. Cost is visible: the cloud “emptied itself,” leaving her forever saturated with lullabies and skinned knees she can no longer postpone.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can one pacifist outweigh ten billion deaths with joy? Pressure tightens as each photo adds mass; the sail must counterbalance genocide or vacuum will swallow her. One meaningful deepening: the bruise corridor forces her to fuse personal sorrow with Kwan Yin’s tear—no retreat. Cost is legible: she forfeits the living world to tend never-born moments.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can a man who owns nothing still give?—tightens when lava road appears only after he releases last possession (bugs). Escalation is textural: each glow recurrence (bugs → footprints → orchids) raises the cost of holding back. Agency preserved: his detour up goat path triggers mountain’s choreography; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Visible price: skin submerged in glass, pockets emptied of value.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“silent revolution before dawn”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Voss nearly catches the seed of light. The meaningful turn is Garnet’s false-report micro-choice that actually arms Luce downstream; cost is legible (her heartbeat, expelled mask). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: fulfill the dying promise to understand patterns before next tide. Escalation is textural—each rock placement tightens the mathematical lattice until the constellation erupts, foreclosing further attempt to understand. Cost is conceptual: Elias must surrender the very need for understanding. No friction means no physical danger, but the epistemic loss is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—her verses must escape erasure—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each tactile step of dissolution; the final rarefaction into “clear liquid” is a visible price that forecloses earthly dissemination. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates (lightning overexposes one print) but does not resolve. Only one tightening beat meets the 600-word density, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can the rivalry be read into reconciliation—tightens when the paper slip reveals the brook’s coded reflection; price is the public abandonment of the duel, but the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“save the library from bulldozers”—is signaled early and tightened when Rourke appears. Protagonist agency drives each turn: burning past selves for legitimacy, rebuilding shelves as cover, leveraging audit optics. Cost is visible on-page: ashes on library card, blank name waiting. One micro-turn suffices at this length; no reliance on coincidence to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“is waiting still a form of playing?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the horizon’s “thin blade of rose” literalizes the dwindling decision window. The meaningful turn occurs inside the film-loop: she discovers passengers wearing her own faces, forcing the recognition that rehearsal must end. Under Accumulative lens, each surreal image (clocks without hands, sprocket holes rimmed with moonlight) escalates the cost of eternal practice versus lived risk. The price is visceral: she exits still carrying the broken clock, its audible tick now hers to compose with, foreclosing the safety of perpetual maybe.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ridge survival vs. memory loss—tightens once: the monochrome canyon widens and the seed demands a memory in exchange. Escalation is causal: because the fissure threatens, therefore she must plant; planting erases mentor, narrowing future checking to number-work. Cost is visible—she wakes “mind hollow,” fingers already guiding children into doubt-weave. Coincidence absent; monsoon arrival is environmental clock, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—diffuse cerulean regret—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates through each lace fold. The second instruction’s knot visibly slows the compass needle, forcing a trade-off between holding regret and moving forward. Final exhale forecloses the option to speak the apology aloud; cost is the permanent transfer of color to bonsai. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal needed for lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—calibrating cosmic and human timescales via butterfly dust—is signaled early and tightens when the synchrotron pings at 03:17. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to work through storms, prioritize data over safety. Cost is felt in lost career momentum, unresolved grief, and physical exposure. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern accumulation, not causal turns—valid and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in the “pause between sale and seizure”—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the ledger isn’t a map forward but “permission to step off the path.” Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting frost, planting then retrieving beads, choosing stillness over pursuit. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the quest for names/revenge, accepting uncertainty. The ash-circle campfire and outward-pointing bootprints crystallize the smugglers’ schism, forcing her reconfiguration without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving silence isn’t emptiness—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes music persists as “thermal emotion.” Her agency drives escalation: each fork strike deepens the heat-map, culminating in audience harmonization. Cost is unmistakable: the *Auralight*’s loss, vanished sound, and her isolation. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until dome “weeps” melted frost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (“give rest a permanent address”) is signaled early and escalates through the undertaker’s agency: he chooses to descend, locate the catalog, ignite memory-boats, and accept tenure. The tightening occurs when he realizes the lens requires amplification—forcing him to sacrifice graveside memories as fuel. Cost is unmistakable: his own name appears in Perpetual Repose, marking his transition from caretaker to cared-for. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his stubborn yet compassionate will under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational continuity under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens when baby formula appears, forcing higher risk. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses frequency over volume, initiates the second ledger, and places the final pebble to inch toward exodus. Cost is unmistakable: memories will be “rationed,” elders and orphans must be woven into “a single rope of years.” Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under sanctions’ tightening grip.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preventing unused love from rotting the heart—is signaled early and deepens through the man’s arrival: “I lost the address of the love I never gave.” Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she invites him into the camera, loosens the tear, matches his breath. The tightening occurs when shared breathing makes projected flowers glow, revealing “withheld tenderness.” Cost is unmistakable: the child-memory returns not as vision but temperature—the soldier already dead—and healing requires surrendering the tear, which vanishes with the camera, leaving only an afterimage. Love’s storage demands reciprocity; isolation calcifies, communion heals.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against time’s erosion—is signaled early (“photographs... fading”) and tightens relentlessly: each turning erases another photo, escalating to total disintegration. Protagonist agency drives escalation (she *chooses* to follow the halo’s glow, peel the bark), forcing a trade-off between transcending time or becoming its anchor. Cost is visceral: future tears “filtered as sap,” roots supplanting veins. The hyperbolic geometry isn’t just backdrop—it’s the mechanism that makes stakes inescapable, narrowing options until only sacrifice remains.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—securing heritage grains before the wall falls—tightens when guards enter, forcing the liberator to impede them silently. Her agency drives escalation: decoding keys → locating vault → diverting guards via cellophane arrow → planting seeds under fire. The meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses non-lethal obstruction (risking capture) over gunfire (which would bury the vault), narrowing options with visible cost: time lost, chain still dragging, regime sirens converging. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each beat intensifying through sensory and symbolic density rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—imprinting trust’s fracture—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes betrayal includes her own doubt. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to feed the forge her brother’s echoless laugh, then presses her ear to iron to capture the waveform. Cost is unmistakable: the orchard absorbs her “fresher wound,” and dawn arrives “ultraviolet,” signaling irreversible change. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer deepens the moral weight without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost memory—is signaled early and deepens when the thief must choose between stealing anew or restoring. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she deciphers the flower code, negotiates payment, then pivots to reinterpretation upon recognizing the ring’s inscription. Cost is unmistakable: she forgoes a portrait (her livelihood) and risks thinning time’s fabric, yet chooses reconciliation. Coincidence (the platform’s date match) complicates but doesn’t resolve—it triggers earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—tightens meaningfully when Mara abandons her plan to carry the dome away, recognizing sanctuary belongs where needed, not where she flees. This deepening is driven by her agency (narration, construction choices) under Accumulative pressure: each repurposed object (bookmark spine, tape reinforcement) raises the conceptual cost of isolation. The climax crystallizes stance without external opposition; coincidence (cardamom scent) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in her laugh—first unguarded sound since coastal studio—and the dome left as lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability has value—tightens when heirs threaten brand retirement. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decrypting cast → retrieving shell → projecting uncut reel. Cost is unmistakable: risking total erasure to claim authenticity. “Betray the frame” becomes actionable instruction, not metaphor, forcing a trade-off between invisibility and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving silence before light abdicates—is signaled early and deepens as the star fades. Agency manifests through attention and inscription; each symbol drawn narrows options (e.g., compressing decades into one graphite line). Cost is unmistakable: the oracle trades breath for fossilization, presence for outline. Escalation is driven by her choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, culminating in a Charged Poise where darkness pours yet the map glows.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding where thoughts come from—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: J4N-17 chooses to touch, then play, the violin across loops. Escalation occurs through accumulated attempts, each narrowing options until only one act remains: drawing the bow. Cost is unmistakable—the eternity of repetition—but reweighted as generative. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or external resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and tightens when eavesdropping reveals the prank’s unintended harm. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her choice to follow doodles, then withhold confrontation, forces Rico and Jun into vulnerability. The cost—social isolation transformed into shared labor—is felt in their pale faces and sweeping side by side. Coincidence never resolves; honesty as method creates the turn, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving mutual recognition between gardener and garden—is signaled early and deepens when the 0.03% score triggers the garden’s defiant gift. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her ritual choices (placing marbles, biting the apple) narrow options toward Charged Poise. Cost is legible: decades of deception mended only through surrender to partnership. Luck complicates but doesn’t resolve; the garden’s response is earned by her lifelong attention.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens when projections reveal her younger self’s hesitation. The tightening occurs when moth-bats’ subsonic hum disrupts the projection, forcing her to choose between rewriting history or accepting symbiosis. Cost is unmistakable: she foregoes organic life to stabilize the station, yet gains companionship in mechanical harmony. Agency drives escalation—she lowers the lever “by degrees”—and the 3:5 pulse ratio raises stakes via xenobiological logic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unsung—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost’s betrayal reframes silence as violence. The musician’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, interpret, and ultimately play transformed music. Cost is felt: he risks obscurity to reject expected harmony. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens—the flood isn’t coincidence but the medium through which truth emerges. One tightening suffices: the staircase descent forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—weighing/swallowing truth—is signaled early and deepens as the seed becomes prophecy. Protagonist agency drives escalation: sketching, smudging, kneeling, coughing up the stone. Each act narrows options (erasing external images to surface internal truth) with visible cost (warped leaves, torn paper, bodily invasion). The “heavier” pulse from instruments forces a trade-off: personal integrity vs. communal innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—appraising her brother’s swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens when the wheel’s tag reveals his betrayal. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to listen, unscrew, speak. Cost is unmistakable—the burden shifts from lead slug to brass relic, and she carries it upward, forgiving yet forever altered. Coincidence complicates (draft, pulse) but resolution stems from her witness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving regenerative silence without interference—is signaled early and tightens when the swan unfolds its final map. The keeper’s agency lies in renunciation, not action; her choice to step onto the mirror forecloses her prior role with irreversible cost (flattened memories, becoming the swan). Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, fitting the lens, though escalation lacks a single decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving “ordinary magic” in screen-glazed children—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the eclipse climax, when magic becomes briefly visible. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elara chooses the precise moment, uses her keepsake as anchor, and sustains the note despite near-failure. Cost is unmistakable: the curl darkens (absorbing new stories), and the children’s altered state persists as discomfort (“pebble in a shoe”). Under the Accumulative lens, density increase reweights the stake with conceptual cost—wonder requires active tending, not passive belief.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost narratives—is signaled early and tightens with each diary, culminating in the child’s account that explains why the tapestry must be returned to a listening wall. The historian’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to probe, climb, descend, and finally press the fragment to concrete. Cost is unmistakable: her solitude is traded for a world that now orbits reclaimed silence—a visible, felt sacrifice crystallized in the final step into “starless dark.”

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—orchestrating disappearance before being forgotten—tightens when Chen realizes the island will “stand inside you,” forcing immediate action. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to embed the bolt-film in a cookie, then untie the skiff. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering identity, leaving behind his only confidant, becoming “wind.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each beat deepens the weight of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing possession by destabilizing certainty—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the priest invites congregants to speak, then fractures their words into textures of doubt. This act narrows the demon’s options: it requires hosts who “know what they want,” but now faces only questions. The priest’s agency drives escalation; cost is unmistakable in his bodily sacrifice and the congregation’s exposed vulnerabilities (widow’s lullaby, banker’s stolen coins). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening through rhetorical and sonic layering until the anchor groans under “simultaneous truths.”

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping childhood before exhaustion forecloses the chance—is signaled immediately and tightens with each etched memory. Agency drives escalation: she chooses which memories to inscribe, how fast to move, when to kneel at the apex. The cost is visceral (buckling knees, iron taste) and conceptual (seeing tomorrow’s exhausted face). The thirty-minute clock isn’t arbitrary—it forces compression that makes every scratch on glass a high-stakes act.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—conquering the self-labyrinth—is signaled early and tightens when the procedural algorithm hiccups, forcing Kael through the fracture. This deepening shifts tactics: he must now negotiate with gravity instead of defying it. Agency drives escalation—his choice to smash the tablet triggers timeline collapse. Cost is unmistakable: loss of all alternate selves, dissolution of the elder Kael, and the irreversible trade of weight for an unspoken name.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled by line two and escalates through Mara’s agency: she chooses backward playback, crafts a new needle, threads the drum. Each act narrows options (destroying the disc to access memory) and exacts cost (confronting muffled grief). Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic; coincidence never resolves. The climax crystallizes when she welcomes grief “like a drumroll,” foreclosing numbness with palpable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—integrity of weather data—tightens decisively when Elara realizes the quarantine masks censored truth, not disease. Her agency drives escalation: choosing lateral movement over compliance, then initiating a counter-archive. Cost is unmistakable—permanent exile underground, risking arrest—and shapes tactics (backward logs, pigeon relay). Coincidence (the message) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices forge the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving scent-memory against olfactory collapse—tightens when Elian risks inhalation, then deepens when the orchid resonates with Lira’s esters. His agency drives escalation: uncapping the vial, pouring the drop, kneeling. Cost is felt in “floral gravity collapsing his chest” and the irreversible offering of the last drop. The “transformation completes” timeframe isn’t passive—it pressures his choice before human scent vanishes entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—choosing between weightless transcendence and weighted embodiment—is signaled early and tightens when the poet finds Marcus’s rope, forcing confrontation with flight vs. witness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: kneeling, tracing, writing patterns, then walking. The deepening occurs in the grotto’s chamber where residue of both Marcus and the beings makes the choice visceral. Cost is unmistakable: enduring Earth’s “slow decay” while others dissolve into light, symbolized by Mrs. Chen’s abandoned garden.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence into generative music—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses incompleteness over resolution. Agency drives escalation: planting the seed, whispering the story, twisting rigging into a bridge. Cost is unmistakable: empty bowl, cracked instrument tradition, drowned stories. The chronic hush lifts only through earned, incomplete gestures—no coincidence resolves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—authentic feeling vs. counterfeit emotion—is signaled early and deepens when Lira admits this isn’t for a client but herself. The tightening occurs when she presses the petal, trading professional invulnerability for raw empathy. Cost is unmistakable: her empire’s premise collapses, vials crack, and she endures the pain as “proof she was still reachable.” Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, with each absorbed emotion narrowing her old path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sustaining invisible networks of care—is signaled early via waived fees and deepened by the envelope’s discovery. Pressure escalates through Marisol’s agency: she chooses to decipher, deliver, and log the act. Cost is legible: she parts with her mother’s photo, a tangible sacrifice. The mistaken address and outdated wharf add friction but don’t resolve; resolution comes from her persistent ethic under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes kinship must be forged. The shared search with the twins escalates pressure by narrowing focus to the heron tag, culminating in the crystal trunk discovery. Protagonist agency drives every turn: she chooses to step under the arbor, join the twins, touch the mercury. Cost is felt in her physical collapse and the irreversible commitment of her breath-glyph, which reconfigures her solitude into connection.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the unsaid final syllable—is signaled early and tightens when Mira must repay every borrowed instant with her future. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each cadence measure deepens commitment and narrows options (e.g., choosing left fork where steam writes musical notation). Cost is unmistakable: unspent future minutes drip away as digit-boats. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—density of time-distortion phenomena grows until the giant’s exhale snaps chronology taut.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss through measurable shapes—tightens when the glass eyes activate the mosaic, forcing a trade-off: accept uncertainty but restore motion. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: placing eyes, aligning pupils, climbing, projecting light. Cost is felt in the dented astrolabe and unburied grief, yet the orchard’s sigh proves stakes were viscerally real. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from ritual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost voices for those who need them—is signaled early and tightens when the girl appears, forcing Elias to choose between secrecy and service. His agency drives escalation: he uncovers fragments deliberately, altering tactics from hoarding to sharing. Cost is legible in his relinquished solitude and the girl’s tears—proof these voices matter. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s escalating confrontation with inexplicable plant behavior. The tightening occurs when the leaf’s veins sync with her pulse, forcing a choice: resist or yield. Her decision to “release her grip on understanding” is protagonist-driven and carries irreversible cost (humanity). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens: each sensory intensification (glowing leaves, humming vines) reweights the central conflict without coincidence resolving tension. The assistant’s quiet stewardship at the end affirms the new stakes—acceptance over control—with visible societal consequence (botanists baffled, visitors changed).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the shell spirals demand interpretation. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow trails, kneel, paint, and accept the exchange. Cost is felt in lost sleep transformed to gift, but the old woman’s backstory slightly dilutes pressure. Coincidence (brooch warming) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Mara’s creative act.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and deepens via the pilgrim’s surrender of observation/participation boundaries. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he offers his memory, accepts the pearl, tries to return the gift. Cost is unmistakable: the seer’s future thins to one strand, and he bears permanent responsibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each corridor choice altering tonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments to hearten the city—is signaled early and deepens when the archivist must prove visionary capacity. Pressure tightens via object loss (mouthpiece), institutional resistance (ledger of “Name (if returned)”), and personal cost (carrying only silence). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: seeking, assembling, bargaining. Coincidence complicates (storm-damaged bell), but resolution stems from earned trust and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—breaking silence—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each confession lights a compartment, heals pavement, and reconfigures space. The single meaningful deepening (cracks → rails → healed sidewalk) narrows options until only speaking remains. Cost is unmistakable: confronting lost art, failed engagement, and self-deception. Coincidence never resolves; every escalation stems from Alden’s choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether grief can be solved by reason—is signaled early and deepens when the tile demands participation over transcription. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to listen, aligns the astrolabe to her mother’s spirals, and ultimately transcribes for “the choir inside her.” The cost is tangible: she abandons archaeological duty, releases the artifact, and embraces unverifiable truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each whale exhalation and memory tightening the thematic vise until the decisive turn at midnight.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what lies after “goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens when the amulet reveals the wooden door. Escalation is driven by Vey’s agency: he chooses to follow the fragment, reveals himself to mutineers, and offers exile in exchange for aid. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders immortality’s infinite corridor for unknown darkness, while mortals inherit restless pilgrimage. The mutiny’s stakes (freedom from immortal oversight) converge with Vey’s desire, creating a shared pressure that crystallizes in collaborative procession toward the door.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—posthumous asylum for her mother—is signaled early and escalates through Cassidy’s active waiting. The tightening occurs at the ink dip: she trades her last honest memory, narrowing her emotional world permanently. Cost is unmistakable (“felt the tune vanish from her mind forever”) and drives the climax. Rurik’s coercion sharpens the ethical calculus without resolving it externally.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—collecting textures of invented times—is signaled immediately and deepens when the labyrinth begins reading her inventories, transforming forgeries into living matter. This escalation is driven by Aurelia’s agency: her decision to keep writing despite fear tightens pressure and forecloses the path of mere fabrication. The cost is legible: she risks “exhaust[ing] the world’s longing,” and the final image confirms silence is now “seeded”—a permanent shift with opportunity cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift (from observation to dictation) reweights the stake with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—validating existence against systemic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara learns the poison targets memory itself. Her agency drives escalation: collecting fragments → receiving the recorder → disseminating voices. The tightening occurs when she chooses to invert the poison’s purpose, foreclosing anonymity as passive survival. Cost is legible: she remains officially dead but gains resonant belonging, paid for by the archivist’s and captain’s deaths.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and deepens when Arlen confronts his own voice’s arrogance. Agency drives escalation: each retold note summons a voice, completes the cello, and reweights belief. Cost is unmistakable—the seashell cracks, revealing the compass that tugs his sternum like a “fishhook.” The tightening forecloses his debunker identity; he walks away carrying only porous truth, guided by heartbeat-as-needle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival vs. commodification—is signaled early and tightens when Syndicate branding appears. Lina’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the graffiti signal, convenes the assembly, and leads the overnight reorganization. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: “privatization had merely been postponed,” yet the act of resistance reweights what survival means. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—each corporate hue intensifies the need for creative defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last bloom before extinction—is signaled early and deepens when the inspector realizes no seed bank or political will exists. Her agency manifests through attention (framing Earth above anemones) and endurance (waiting past tremor), narrowing options until only witnessing remains. The forty-three-minute timer forces trade-offs: water rationed for reaction, contract expiration ignored. Cost is unmistakable: the pink blush beneath basalt confirms irreversible closure, and her voice cracks acknowledging abandoned terraforming dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (delivering medical seeds) tightens via the anchor-lift countdown, forcing Lira to confront not just physical fracture but the drone’s learned terror. Her agency drives escalation: silica patch → spectral test → recalibration via water. Cost is unmistakable—the drone’s panic echoes her trauma, making repair an act of shared endurance. Coincidence complicates (swelling battery) but never resolves; solution stems from her method.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—witnessing the convergence before the Registry buries it—is signaled early and deepens when Maren chooses personal truth over bureaucratic compliance. Escalation is driven by her agency: speaking Quechua, descending, tearing the map. Cost is visible (dead falcon, abandoned outpost) and conceptual (myth dismissed as fiction). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern density rather than causal turns, satisfying band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring Viremont’s “shared balance”—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the north ward resists, forcing Elian to escalate from external tuning to internal sacrifice. His agency drives every turn: walking circuits, offering his heartbeat, shattering the fork. The cost—his corporeal erasure—is unmistakable and irrevocable, crystallizing in the final image of him “transparent at the edges.” Pressure accumulates texturally (silence → rhythm → song → reconstruction) under the Accumulative lens, with each deepening (fork brightening, spirits manifesting, stubborn ruins) narrowing options until only self-offering remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting a distress call before air runs out—tightens when the temple actively muffles sound, forcing Mira to seek the organ. Her agency drives escalation: she overrides instinct, descends deeper, and sacrifices her last Earth-scented keepsake. Cost is unmistakable: the vial’s depletion, burning lungs, and near-certain death even after success. The deepening occurs when silence becomes active resistance (“stone tendrils wrapped the radio mast”), narrowing options to one desperate tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—truth’s recoverability in a lineage of lies—is signaled early and deepens through Cassian’s agency: each step re-strings a lie into a truth-bead. The meaningful tightening occurs when the lattice reveals the father “was not lying the last night, only early,” forcing Cassian to confront the cost of inherited narrative. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off: becoming the wolf (truth incarnate) means accepting the parable’s burden. The timeframe (“before they find the bodies”) adds urgency without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repaying ancestral debt—is signaled early and deepens through each visitation, narrowing options until only symbolic fruit can balance scales. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the ghost chooses mercy over blood, the boy offers his wrist then accepts the apricot. Cost is unmistakable: the orchard dies, the ghost scatters, and the boy inherits lifelong responsibility. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with the bead’s pulse and fruit ripening serving as visceral intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring broken precedents through hauntingly optimistic weaving—is signaled early and tightens at the cavern loom when Calyx realizes memory alone is insufficient; he must bleed optimism into the work. This deepening forces a trade-off: his blood for blooming orchids, his unrest for rebuilt stairs. The cost is unmistakable: the plate dissolves, the loom sinks, and his footprints smooth under foam—proof of irreversible change. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (sewing, climbing, whispering), not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith through rebuilding—tightens meaningfully when the mirrors fracture her reflection into twelve exiled generations, revealing that interrupted journeys are collective. This deepening forces the turn: she must rebuild not just a structure but a “circuit of belief,” paid for by her permanent residence. Agency drives escalation—each alignment, hymn-teaching, and root-following narrows options until only presence remains. Coincidence complicates (missionaries’ past violence) but never resolves; dawn’s reassembly stems solely from her ritual act.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—authenticity vs. safety—is signaled early and deepens when the drone arrives early, forcing a compressed choice. The tightening (mail drone at 6:17) narrows options to seconds, raising cost: sending the unsigned letter means accepting permanent ambiguity. Her agency drives escalation—writing chalk codes, drafting two letters, drawing the gateway—and the final renunciation crystallizes stance under coherent pressure. Coincidence (early drone) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she alone decides which truth to surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving unheard stories against cultural erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the map becomes actionable intelligence. The embroiderer’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reveal, to synchronize breathing, to rewrite the night. Cost is unmistakable: political violence averted only through personal risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each stitch, hum, and fold tightens options until the final image reconfigures possibility itself.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching the “space where an apology waits unspoken”—is signaled early and tightens when the medium reveals the seam before the slammed door. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to follow, hold the shard, speak the words. Cost is unmistakable: twenty-seven unsent letters transmute into moths, the cut on the lip heals only after speech, and the brother remains scarred, not magically restored. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each image deepens the emotional weight without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto wounds—is signaled early and deepens when the cast reveals the translator’s birthday and village massacre. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to voice each symbol, transforming confession into shared ritual. Cost is unmistakable: the pulse-stuttering memory cannot be dulled, yet he stays. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens until stakes crystallize in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering irretrievable joy—is signaled early and deepens when the film memory appears. Escalation is driven by Luma’s agency: she summons the Lattice, walks to the cider house, and paints at personal cost. The tightening occurs when the Lattice demands display on a “living wall,” narrowing options to one painful act. Cost is unmistakable (“each brushstroke cost her a sigh”) and paid fully; coincidence complicates (fragment found by chance) but resolution is earned through courage, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early (“methodically playful”) and escalates through three awakenings that narrow Liora’s options: she can no longer restore as if the city were inert. Each deepening forecloses a path (e.g., abandoning rabbit-skin glue’s surety) with visible cost: color drains into “possibility,” not ruin. Agency is maintained—she chooses inversion, follows the ribbon, speaks the lullaby’s truth. The hobo nickel complicates but doesn’t resolve; Liora’s final act (lifting the empty spoon) is earned through her sustained attention, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defending untaxed thought—is signaled immediately and tightens when Voss appears, forcing Arlo to accelerate planting before satellite pass. Agency drives escalation: his choice to activate the club via Lucretius directly triggers pollen release and escape. Cost is visceral (“seed pouch lighter by one”) and conceptual (defiance as taxable offense). The “candidly cryptic” warning’s very obscurity becomes a weapon against surveillance, deepening the moral calculus of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—ending war before it begins—is signaled early and deepened when Zale realizes poets, not generals, sustain the armistice. His agency drives escalation: reading the postscript triggers the chorus, peeling the card releases blossoms, sealing it embeds the treaty. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his identity as insomniac guardian, leaving centuries of longing behind. The “shyly unstoppable” wind complicates but never resolves; Zale’s choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled immediately and escalates via protagonist agency: Lira converts fracture into reed, strikes the fork, feeds memories. Each sacrifice narrows her existence (“hollow into a translucent silhouette”), tightening options until only self-erasure remains. Cost is visceral and cumulative; the chandelier’s demand isn’t external fiat but an emergent rule from the world’s logic, paid in irreplaceable personal history.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through linguistic restitution—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes translation requires restitution, not just mapping. Her agency drives escalation: speaking ash-and-honey syllables triggers the archive’s transformation. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the ink well, her proof, vanishing into the crowd. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each chord written intensifies the counter-melody until the symphony swells beyond her control.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing upstream/downstream needs—is signaled early and deepens when the lullaby transforms discord into duet. Mireya’s agency drives escalation: her analysis, pacing, and singing force a trade-off (gates open three nights, closed others). Cost is felt: both sides relinquish absolute control, yet gain empathy. The mountain’s rhythm becomes their compromise—a visible price that alters tactics and crystallizes stance without bloodshed.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased culture against state-enforced oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when constables arrive, forcing Mirela’s final dispersal. Her agency drives escalation: choosing sanctuary, building the loft, drafting a new identity. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits permanence, becoming airborne refrain. The meteorite chip’s concealment and Inkspot’s missions show tactics shaped by persistent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the sacredness of thresholds—is signaled early and deepens through Juniper’s analysis of wood grain, narrowing options until only the leap remains. Escalation is driven by her agency: each tactile discovery (notches, rings) tightens pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable—the house’s drift severs her from known home, and the maze’s dissolution demands she accept distance as necessary rather than seek return.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: she moves from passive charting to co-creating constellations, then to exhaling her breath into the moon-pipe, each act narrowing escape options. The sunrise deadline creates coherent pressure that tightens tactics (using shell-chalk, striking the match-memory), and the cost—risking permanent exile among barnacled ghosts—is felt in her deliberate slowness. Agency is clear: Vesper’s ghost offers ritual, but she chooses to complete it, transforming telemetry into ceremony. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her decisions under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Lira’s conjecture leads to tactile investigation, which yields emotional insight (“cliff had grown lonely”), which fuels her creative solution. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from recovering the old path to inventing a new story. Cost is unmistakable: the cliff’s golden abandonment pang and Lira’s acceptance of future memory fade. Luck (the bird) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Lira’s insight and action.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—serenading monotony—is signaled early and deepens when Cipher engineers serendipity via the ferret gambit. Escalation is driven by his agency: placing the cup, retreating, syncing pulse to tide. Cost is visible in his forfeiture of the jackpot and emotional detachment from tip overflow. Coincidence (ferret’s leap) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the waltz and confessions bloom from his initial setup, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—inscribing uncensorable memory—tightens through Lysira’s agency: she chooses to dance faster as dawn approaches, sacrificing the moonstone’s last grain to complete the verse. Each inscription forecloses a path (no return to anonymity) with felt cost (aching salt-wound sentences, burning dust). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; escalation peaks in bodily transformation, not external threat. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—illuminating unpaid debts of beauty—is signaled early and deepens through each ring’s revelation. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for visions but actively communes, interprets, speaks reparations, then hurls the prism to enact change. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering her sole prism (a relic of the abandoned lighthouse) to heal others’ brokenness. The tightening—from private reckoning to public healing—narrows her path to irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into universal language—is signaled early and deepens when ash becomes ink. Elias’s agency drives escalation: swallowing ash, speaking aloud, drawing the spiral. Each act narrows his path from mute endurance to vocal witness, with tangible cost (tears, emptied box, exposed scar). The celestial timeframe intensifies pressure but never resolves it; resolution stems solely from his choices under coherent, accumulating weight.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing consensus reality—is signaled early and tightens when the gauge resets to zero despair, forcing Mira to risk blood and selfhood. Agency drives escalation: her equation-writing triggers the balloon’s expansion and cross-reality synchrony. Cost is unmistakable in the evaporating “potential” rain and erased footprints—hope requires surrender of permanence. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping abandonment—deepens into inheriting “legacy’s burden,” with each revelation narrowing Mira’s options: from observer to subject, then to vessel. Her agency drives escalation—she chooses to descend, to touch the negatives, to recognize herself in the frames. The cost is total self-erasure, made legible when her scream at age seven prefigures her dissolution. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses escape with haunting finality.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the third mirror’s ultimatum, forcing a trade-off: keep the heartbeat (paint alone forever) or gift it (risk deception). Protagonist agency drives escalation: her lullaby-weaving and sphere-pressing actively reshape each mirror’s response. Cost is unmistakable on the page: she surrenders her “compass or currency,” stepping into anonymity so others may see possible selves. The moral calculus—individual memory versus collective imagination—sharpens the peak choice without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—anchoring ideals in practice through remembrance—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes burning the list isn’t enough; he must speak the names. Escalation is driven by his agency: arranging offerings, voicing names, lifting the transformed clipboard. Cost is unmistakable: the terrace crumbles, peace remains fragile, and the burden shifts from one man to many. Coincidence (the gathered enemies) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their ascent is drawn by his ritual, not plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinction—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist bribes climatologists to choreograph humidity and static charge. His agency drives escalation: financing the drought, then engineering its precise undoing for one night. Cost is unmistakable: the map vanishes, the egg becomes stone, and he carries a hollow voice forever. The tightening forecloses any future attempt—this was the only moment it could work.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defying the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and escalates via Lys’s agency: each untangled knot retracts snow, exposes mosaics, and vibrates the sanctuary toward collapse. Cost is unmistakable: predecessors’ failed escapes manifest as weeping mercury, and freedom’s “terrifying lullaby” replaces obedience. The tightening choice—surrendering echoes to void rather than escaping—forecloses personal liberation for collective awakening. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: echo-density intensifies until citywide gasps shatter dream-chains.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether art must serve revolution or remain autonomous—is signaled early and deepens through the puppet-show visions that force Lucien to confront his own compromises and refusals. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to burn the stick, speak backward, then reverse his reversal. The cost is felt in lost patronage, physical pain, and the irreversible consumption of the stick. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where options (serve slogans vs. refuse) are reconfigured into a third path: lettering with questions.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving ephemeral histories temporary form—is signaled early and deepens when the twin butterfly arrives, transforming ritual into reciprocal witness. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she accelerates her work, integrates ferns, accepts dissolution as necessary. Cost is unmistakable: the memorial lifts away, leaving only fading imprints. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with the monarch migration acting as a live clock that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before glacial erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s technical gentleness and ritual precision. Escalation occurs via embodied agency: he doesn’t find a solution but constructs one, reconfiguring the rope strand by strand. Cost is unmistakable: the punched card dissolves, his tears freeze and crack, and he accepts lifelong carriage of voices. Pressure tightens not through external opposition but internalized historical responsibility, coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens when the dream reveals the path that “devours the chooser.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she offers her dream-bird memory, steps into the storm-cataract, and consents to being “worn smooth.” The cost is unmistakable: her fixed identity dissolves, her name unthreads, and continuity itself unravels into moss—yet this loss enables transcendence, satisfying the directive’s evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving Babylon’s sky charts against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Naram-bel chooses ritual over survival. Agency drives escalation: drawing symmetries → lattice projection → door unbarred → chamber entry. Cost is unmistakable: he becomes spectral, heard only in dusk. Coincidence never resolves; pure number, not luck, unlocks the sanctum. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the pressure could intensify further during the sanctum crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—teaching release through cellular memory—is signaled early and tightens when the sanctuary demands balance, forcing Lira to confront her own resentment. Escalation is driven by her agency: angling the box, accepting the shadow, setting it down. Cost is unmistakable—the broken pin, silenced song, unopened crates of anger—and reweights the final image. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural logic; coincidence never resolves, only deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the runaway dream to heal isolation—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: each breath deepens risk, culminating in self-laceration that forecloses passivity. The cost (three blood drops, centuries of fog dissolved) is unmistakable and alters the world permanently. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases via breath cycles until the corridor seals “with a sound like a sigh resigned to memory.” Coincidence never resolves; the dream is drawn closer solely through synchronized breathing and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping the orchard alive despite breached contract—is signaled immediately and deepens when the mender opens the forbidden pouch, narrowing her options to ancestral methods. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: each object used (ribbon, gear, pollen) raises emotional and symbolic stakes. The cost is unmistakable—she sacrifices institutional validation for organic justice, sleeping beneath the graft while elders wait outside. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves, only complicates (wind shifting, fig dropping).

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge at the cost of one’s past—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Each act of inquiry (whispering to cameo, stepping through mirror) erases a kindness, narrowing options until the only path is self-merger. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under Accumulative pressure: the bathroom’s plumbing reveals erased deeds as fertilizer, forcing her to inscribe a deeper question. Cost is unmistakable: lost birthdays swirl down the drain, and the trees demand their stories back.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering unlearned lessons before ignorance flowers into war—is signaled early and tightens when the door demands an unspeakable word. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she proposes renegotiation, crossbreeds pronouns with lullabies, and pronounces the word at personal cost. The single meaningful deepening (borrowing/lending future syllables) narrows options and raises emotional price. Coincidence (time traveler’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her resourceful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recapturing their true name—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly: each mirror-pane version without a name heats the card, forcing collection of fragments. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—she chooses to enter the maze, stitch heat-spots into her coat, recite syllables—each act narrowing options toward irreversible unity. Cost is unmistakable: the ship sinks, audience vanishes, and only a single lily remains. The “blissfully aberrant” stride embodies the central tension between height and depth, making every step a high-stakes negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to historical absence—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the treaty collapsed over identical swan-necked seals. Her agency drives escalation: each braid twist alters time’s structure, shedding “flakes of oxidized time.” The cost is unmistakable—the rope bleeds wax, the seal dissolves, and she shoulders the burden so students inherit an unvisited village. Coincidence (the unmarked envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems wholly from her ritualized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving pre-invasion memory through silence—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly: the “bloom of hush” window forces immediate action, the southern gallery’s hum raises urgency, and the beings’ presence at the dome escalates to marrow-threatening vibration. Agency is clear: the mapkeeper’s ice-reading initiates the plan; her and Jalen’s coordinated fracturing of sound pathways drives resolution. Cost is unmistakable—the echo stone cracks open, releasing all stored voices in a sigh that carries no sound, only irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the shard of hush demands bodily sacrifice (prying it from fused palms). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she walks seven nights, reads star paths, endures desert muteness. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s skeleton embodies the price of hope, and her return forecloses anonymity for eternal vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—identity under archival erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the archivist realizes purity equals amputation. Escalation is driven by her agency: measuring lightning shadows, snapping the quill, sculpting the fog figure. Each act narrows options until synthesis becomes the only path forward. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits archival legitimacy and descends “no longer archivist nor artifact,” leaving behind a self that may never be remembered.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defying enforced despair—is signaled early and deepens when Jax reveals the governor’s policy. Luma’s agency drives escalation: she trades, deceives (hiding the fuse), and stakes her craft on one demonstration. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering her art forever if she fails. The governor’s “razor-thin nod” crystallizes pressure, making the rocket’s success a live-or-die test of hope’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether reconciliation is possible—is signaled early and deepened through the chronicler’s tangential method. Agency lies in attention: she chooses to shift the lantern, offer the cicada, speak only metaphorically. The meaningful tightening occurs when the daughter arrives; silence becomes shared observation, narrowing the path from estrangement to tentative union. Cost is legible in the “awkward jokes” and inherited sideways seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—escaping internalized confinement—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Lira actively collects, trades, and finally releases silences. Each encounter escalates pressure (iron → lullaby → bolt-sigh → birth/death mute), narrowing options until she must choose between carrying the bunker or breathing freely. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves the doll, her last tether to maternal memory, wedged in the vines.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence as comfort—is signaled early and deepens when the commuter’s pulse breaches the decibel limit. Nilo’s agency drives escalation: he slows the gondola not to enforce rules but to demonstrate how stillness can hold fear. Cost is unmistakable: the commuter risks shame to speak; Nilo bears the weight of every crystallized fear in his private constellation. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (whistles, prisms, fluid shifts) intensifies the emotional calibration required.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reuniting truth with legacy—is signaled early and tightens as the waterfall’s pattern shifts, creating real time pressure. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: decoding murals, interfacing with ancient tech, stepping onto the light-staircase. Cost is legible in the weight of history and the burden of responsibility, though the physical/emotional toll remains abstract. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from her knowledge and tools.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—teaching the dead to breathe by suffocating—is signaled early and tightens when the boy’s presence forces confrontation with her own unresolved pain. The meaningful deepening occurs when she links scars, sharing trauma to dissolve it—a choice that narrows her emotional isolation at visible cost (reliving her own suffocation). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Cost is legible but could be sharper in tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—liberation from psychic debt—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Lira initiates contact, crawls to the drip line, completes the circuit, and twists the bolt. The tightening is decisive: each action narrows options until the bolt shears, converting regret into diamond with blood-drawn cost. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—glitch-texts, hum frequency, spore language all intensify toward the transmutation. Coincidence never resolves; every escalation stems from Lira’s choices under inherited trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the warm crank implies surveillance, raising risk. Arin’s agency drives escalation: turning the handle is a deliberate act that forecloses anonymity. Cost is unmistakable: blood signs a new treaty, name is lost, future is river-bound. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each rotation deepens moral weight, culminating in public testimony that shifts the city’s posture.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility’s shape—is signaled early and tightens when the knight realizes it demands surrender, not conquest. His agency drives escalation: choosing choreography, unsnapping the clasp, accepting wooden transformation. Cost is unmistakable—human sensation lost, armor shed, identity ceded—and alters tactics (he stops seeking, becomes the guardian). The trade-off (“become the thing possibility abandoned”) crystallizes under Accumulative pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether small kindnesses can redeem systemic abandonment—is signaled early and deepened through Rowan’s discovery and decision. Escalation is driven by her agency: noticing the button, reading dust, inserting it into Marcus’s file. The cost is felt in her solitude and the fragility of her hope (“unknown, but breathing”). Though coincidence introduces the button, resolution stems from her choice, not luck—she reroutes history through deliberate, vulnerable action.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—resisting the tyranny of indifference through recovered speech—is signaled early and deepens when Mira hears her own erased childhood call. Pressure escalates via drone patrols, time constraints (guard shift), and technical risk (azimuth alignment), all navigated through protagonist agency. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses broadcast over escape, foreclosing personal safety for collective reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: vulnerability under spotlights, exposure to arrest, and the emotional toll of hearing overwritten love.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (silencing the prophecy before it names his death) tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure: each arpeggio risks awakening the “sleeping animal” beneath the world. Protagonist agency drives escalation—he counters with diminished chords, trills, backward notes—each narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable: spectral voices reveal his daughter’s dress color, his childhood nickname dissolving. The “vested hush” buckling shows stakes materialize viscerally, not abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring equilibrium through remembrance—is signaled early and escalates via Mireya’s agency: she decodes runes, crafts monuments, and ultimately releases the moonstone. Each act forecloses passivity; the cost is visible in her transformed body and role. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of monuments intensifies until the sky accepts offerings. Coincidence never resolves; the prophecy is a dialogue answered by mortal action.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—intensifies coherently: from noticing leaf patterns to surrendering artifacts in the pool. Elias’s agency drives escalation (choosing to descend, dunk, release), with cost legible in abandoned clocks and self-invented time. Coincidence (three-seventeen) complicates but never resolves; pressure crystallizes into stance without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redemption through understanding the weight of names—is signaled early and deepens through three explored limits, culminating in the fourth: redemption as calibration, not destination. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: each ritual act (weighing, calcining, binding) narrows emotional options and raises conceptual stakes. Cost is unmistakable: tears add weight, rust becomes gold, and she abandons solitude to carry “luminous regret” into the world. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—integrating lost laughter into healing—is signaled early and tightens when the giggle flees toward the harp’s “wrong notes.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she climbs, uses the tooth on the string, and offers silence-as-invitation. Cost is unmistakable—the child’s blue cheeks, the snapped harp string releasing “every lullaby ever hummed”—and the gorge’s slowed river shows environmental consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens; no off-stage resolutions or static loops.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—extracting mercy from infinite suffering—is signaled early and tightens through three equations that narrow understanding without resolving pain. Agency is exercised via bracing, counting steps, tearing off the strap—all choices that foreclose paths (e.g., no return to passive penitence). Cost is unmistakable: the strap grows into flesh like a “wedding ring made of scars,” and removal leaves a wet wound. Escalation is driven by proprioceptive spikes that force confrontations with memory, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories by releasing rather than collecting—tightens decisively when the protagonist chooses to return the fragment, foreclosing his identity as keeper. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each step (pausing at stall, leaning into painting, stepping through) narrows options until only surrender remains. The cost—loss of the fragment, transformation from translator to listener—is unmistakable in “pockets empty yet resonant.” Coincidence (painter’s death) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems solely from the protagonist’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to fix or fall—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara climbs not with muscles but memory, engages the moment like a mis-leveled car. The tightening occurs when she sees her past self, forcing renunciation of control. Cost is unmistakable: accepting that cables only postpone the fall. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of ghosts, tickets, and temporal layers—culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses mechanical repair in favor of existential ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring narrative coherence via the bottled whisper—is signaled early and tightens when Corwin types “The rupture begins with breathing,” triggering systemic collapse. Escalation is driven by his agency: uncorking the whisper, feeding vellum, inhaling the spiral. Cost is unmistakable: ballast-books slide, keeper dissolves, time folds. The deepening shift—from repair to surrender—reweights reality itself, with Corwin accepting rupture as necessary breath.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unrealized futures—is signaled early and deepens when Aurelia chooses poetic reimagining over artifact preservation. Her agency drives escalation: covering mirrors thwarts the storm, crushing the shard seeds a new world. Cost is unmistakable: her body dissolves, yet her verses endure. The archaeologist’s intrusion raises pressure without resolving via coincidence—he’s transformed by her act, not its solver.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming light for his daughter’s art—is signaled early and deepens when Elias admits he came “not to save the city first.” The tightening occurs at the tethering moment: honesty becomes the price, narrowing options to raw confession. Cost is unmistakable: exposing his failure as a father. Escalation is driven entirely by Elias’s agency under a Causal lens, with no coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—locating “the place where explanations fail”—tightens decisively when the lagoon demands tribute over testimony, forcing Ivy to sacrifice her collection. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to delve, initiates psychometry, and uncorks every vial. Cost is unmistakable: decades of gathered petrichor released, compass dissolved, identity transformed. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through increasing sensory density until the final trade-off crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—deciding if the slide is gift or geas—intensifies when the storm forces action, narrowing options to carving or fleeing. Maela’s agency drives escalation: she wedges the slide, carves with memory, and chooses unmarked maps over GPS. Cost is unmistakable—the slide dissolves, her skiff remains battered, and she rows outward alone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each shadow thickening raises stakes until the fleet kneels, making refusal impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal bloom—is signaled immediately and deepens through Liora’s embodied reckoning with shadow. Agency manifests not in grand action but in sustained attention: waiting through frost, tracing vines onto glass. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes “the answer had never been about light but about absence,” foreclosing her lifelong pursuit of dawn. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of control—the mural grows without her, entrusted to seasons and strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering suppressed truth—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist-driven trades: future for past, life for names. Each parley deepens cost (“hour of my own death by ink-poisoning”) and narrows options until only public revelation remains. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence never resolves. The lagoon’s rules are consistent and paid for in marrow.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth over comfort—tightens when the bottle “hunger[s]” for scrolls, forcing a trade-off: preserve memories intact or release them to wind. Protagonist agency drives escalation: conceiving rituals, naming streets, burning lanterns. Cost is unmistakable: “memory is also solvent,” dissolving the self even as it rebuilds civilization. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled early and deepens when the archive inverts to consume him. Ambrose’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to immerse the shaving, triggering the memory that confirms his fate. Cost is unmistakable: his body becomes the city’s resonant chamber for broken promises. Coincidence (school group’s phonograph) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the prophecy’s cruelty stems from his own trait (dead-language fluency) enabling comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reopening linear time by decreasing entropy—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: she doesn’t wait for fate but kneels, breathes names, cracks the cap. Escalation is textural (seeds levitate, water reverses) but culminates in a decisive trade-off: she fractures herself to circulate time, rejecting binary preservation/surrender. Cost is felt in the “empty” pocket now “full of spirals”—a conceptual price made tactile. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—listening vs. noise—is signaled early and deepens when the rope “twitch[es] like a fish testing a line,” forcing Mara to choose bell over siren. Her agency drives escalation: she logs anomalies, builds the toggle, overrides protocol. Cost is felt in her isolation (“humble storm siren tester”) and the irreversible civic breach. The microclimate hiccup (03:17 pressure drop) isn’t coincidence—it’s the mountain’s test, which Mara answers with bronze, not steel.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling human fragility with cosmic transience—is signaled early and deepens through the janitor’s nightly empathy practice, which escalates from passive observation to active dialogue (“whispering apologies”). The Perseid storm forces a trade-off: he must surrender the lantern’s hoarded memory to receive the meteor’s vision, foreclosing his role as keeper of relics. Cost is unmistakable in the transparent glass and his departure, though the story leans slightly more on lyrical accumulation than causal tightening; the meteor’s question arrives via vision rather than hard-won dialectic.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words against entropy—is signaled early and tightens when the child ghost arrives with her invisible jar, raising the cost from memory-keeping to active reception. Alden’s agency drives escalation: he opens the box, kneels, waits, then whispers. The fracture introduces a live constraint that forces a trade-off (mend vs. flee), and the final choice forecloses escape with palpable emotional weight. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through ghostly arrivals and material decay.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through the garage sale’s narrative economy. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he reads tags, contributes his own, trades the urn fragment, and internalizes the new system. Cost is felt in his ribs as “Braille” and conceptualized in the shift from measurement to exchange. Coincidence (the boy’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the core transformation stems from his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and deepens when the horizon feels “wounded.” The poet’s agency drives escalation: he shifts from solitary observation to collaborative weaving with the woman, then actively repairs the zither string. Cost is legible in the chipped tooth (a “lunar” absence), the torn feather, and the erased sand-writing—all embodying loss that enables creation. The tightening occurs when he realizes his task isn’t to finish but to “let [the chord] hover,” foreclosing closure as goal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—securing interspecies continuity before death—is signaled immediately and deepens through Mara’s agency: each pruning rewrites prayer, each graft serves multiple species. Pressure escalates texturally: hands shake in month five, yet tremor becomes lullaby; tourists’ silence marks communal witness. Cost is unmistakable: Mara’s name and pulse are surrendered into copper, her body absent by story’s end. The spiral wire’s completion forces a decisive reconfiguration of ecological voice.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding whether “home” can be chemically synthesized—is signaled early and deepens when the amber dissolves into spores that rewrite memory. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she activates the recorder, presses amber to bronze, inhales the spores knowingly. Cost is unmistakable: the tower collapses, the path vanishes, and belonging is revealed as nostalgia’s isotope. One meaningful tightening suffices—the fly’s wingbeat catalyzes irreversible conceptual loss.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a blood-soaked battlefield through pre-linguistic memory—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: choosing the “forgive” pod, speaking trilobite tongues, scattering seeds. Pressure escalates texturally: from silent arrival to bleeding voice, culminating in vines wrapping bayonets. Cost is unmistakable—the coachman’s living tongue bleeds, his carriage’s weapon-carrying function foreclosed—and directly shapes tactics (using bird calls to locate the bloodiest acre). The gull’s reply narrows options to one precise action, fulfilling the lens’s requirement for a meaningful deepening with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle reframes it as collapseable separation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Kite’s decision to press leaf to cylinder creates the new groove that reveals coordinates. Cost is unmistakable: Scraps’ limp, the brother’s buried suffering, the risk of false hope. Coincidence complicates (finding the leaf), but resolution stems solely from character choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling survival guilt with maternal legacy—is signaled early and deepens when the compass needle spins toward an impossible vector. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the sliver of light, crawl into the crawlspace, and take his mother’s hand. Cost is felt in the irreversible departure from linear time and physical reality. Coincidence never resolves; the intercom voice and moving maps emerge from established emotional logic, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—amending truth—is signaled early and deepens when Vespers swaps the bishop containing “how to fall upward,” tilting reality itself. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each move on the chessboard extracts emotional cost (mother’s laughter, first lie), culminating in Halcyon’s leap of faith. The tightening is decisive—once the board tilts, retreat is impossible—and the price is legible in the spire’s collapse and Vespers’ empty pockets. Coincidence complicates (sky convulsing) but never resolves; agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving small gestures against historical erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Kestrel enters, transforming solitary archiving into shared witness. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she completes “remember” despite boots approaching, then spells “Adel” in response to his question. The cost is conceptual yet visceral: truth preserved requires cutting softness free of context that might shame it. No luck resolves tension; every turn arises from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming home’s shape without perpetuating prophecy’s violence—is signaled early and deepens when the custodian demands reburial. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she refuses his exchange, cracks her reflection, triggers lightning. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering all talents (“shards falling like silver rain”) to free the town. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of trapped weather/bottled grief culminates in the burning cataract of alphabets, forcing her decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through reframing guilt—is signaled early and deepens when Marek realizes the stitched game is a portrait, not a puzzle. His agency drives escalation: decoding leads to mental replay, which triggers insight that alters his physical action (walking the maze). Cost is unmistakable: he abandons the illusion of solving regret, accepting instead that “the board is wider than the mistake.” Coincidence never resolves; thunder’s release is consequence, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—refracting truth to diffuse blame—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes “the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening.” Her agency drives escalation: climbing, angling light, improvising poetry, then choosing silence. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts burden (“I accept the cost”) before the spire cracks. The one-hour clock pressures tactics without becoming mechanical, and the priests’ arrival validates stakes without resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when healing the statue risks workshop collapse. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her tracing creates the pattern that forces the climactic choice. Cost is unmistakable: each snapped chain literalizes sacrifice; final tally (“Damage accepted”) crystallizes stance under coherent pressure. No coincidence resolves—only her deliberate press against the porthole.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against industrial erasure—is signaled instantly by the mirror cracking as Ren paints the quay. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: he chooses to walk inland, enter the cleft, copy the shell, and finally embed his work. Each deepening (shell’s advancing image, recognition of his younger self) narrows options until only transference remains. Cost is felt in lost home, abandoned tools, and irreversible departure—but crystallized in the “second heart” of temporary eternity, making the final image resonate with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outtravel shouts—is signaled early and deepens when the keeper trades mechanical certainty (foghorns) for biological fragility (scent, pulse). Escalation is driven by her agency: each action (climbing, adjusting light, descending, whispering) tightens the experiment’s parameters until the boat’s course shift validates her thesis. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts invisibility (“ships guided by whispers rather than warnings”) and the perpetual labor of transmitting unsaid love. The lighthouse’s learned tenderness crystallizes the stakes’ transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: each phone call raises bodily cost (soldering hair, speaking names into bronze), narrowing options until only self-offering remains. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: she chooses to obey, to build backward, to step into the spiral. Cost is unmistakable—her stitched body unravels, coat grows heavy, she becomes dust. Coincidence never resolves; moon-phase mechanics are established rules, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when the mixture spills, forcing the narrator to confront whether safety means muting or holding others’ pain. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to drink again, this time to carry. Cost is unmistakable—the luminous film forces confrontation with every lover who left, every child who cried louder. The textbook’s warning (“cure completes only if witnessed”) crystallizes stakes without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s death-message—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating gaps that narrow Maris’s reality. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to “read absences,” logging anomalies, then breaking the cycle by releasing the flower. Cost is unmistakable: loss of cherished memories enables restoration of gulls, horn, and reflection. The tightening culminates in a trade-off where memory becomes currency, paid to restore cosmic order.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—choosing one’s true path—is signaled early and tightens at the doorway where Elias must act. The creek’s rising water imposes a live clock, and the chip’s warmth escalates tension physically. Agency is clear: Elias chooses despite fear. Cost is legible (“carrying away the old life”), though the emotional price of abandonment remains abstract rather than dramatized through loss of a concrete object or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving her name/memory—is signaled early and tightens decisively when starlight pools as “memory escaping the world.” The queen’s agency drives escalation: she climbs despite lacy menace, interprets the shard’s revelation, and chooses self-immolation in the crown. Cost is legible in molten silver hissing on stone and mirrors cracking kingdom-wide. Coincidence never resolves; fireflies’ arrival merely marks the deadline, not salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing presence without killing it—tightens when Corin confesses his pocket-suns sell “holes where moments should be.” His agency drives escalation: crushing the sphere forecloses his alchemist livelihood with visible cost (destroyed inventory). Mira’s pressure crystallizes his stance; her whispered secret forces the renunciation. The scientifically romantic paradox (“how to preserve now without making it then”) sharpens the moral calculus between commodification and communion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether stories can save her—tightens when the scroll forbids landing, forcing renunciation over resolution. Her agency drives escalation: reading, adding to, then surrendering the scroll. Cost is unmistakable: words reduced to ash, footprints she hasn’t made yet, the corpse in the grave who “no longer had to choose.” The deepening (“jealousy of past selves”) alters tactics—she stops trying to fix time and begins mapping its collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—can meaning persist without sensory proof?—is signaled early and deepens when Mira reads the screw’s “panic” in its scratches. The tightening occurs when she chooses to reassemble the clamp not for function but commemoration, foreclosing her own desire for olfactory restoration in favor of symbolic stewardship. Cost is felt in her silent endurance and the irreversible shift from aromatherapist to emotional midwife. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming traumatic memory into speakable story—is signaled early and tightens at the twelfth stroke, where failure means inversion (as with her brother). Lina’s agency drives escalation: she deliberately courts the same timing, using scholarly precision to confront superstition. Cost is unmistakable: crystallized breath shatters internally, quill splits, voice risks annihilation. The typhoon’s arrival coincides with success, but doesn’t resolve—it amplifies the earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with her exorcised sister—is signaled early and deepens when the apology “clings like rosin.” Pressure escalates causally: induced current guides her to the score, the drop’s refusal to fall forces verbal confession, and chainsaws outside raise urgency. Protagonist agency drives escalation—she chooses metaphor over magic, words over perfume—and pays visible cost: the orchard’s destruction coincides with release. Coincidence (tractors idling) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her vocalized regret.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions before expulsion—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: she opens the dictionary to “reality,” steps into her footprints, whispers her name, all narrowing options toward inward collapse. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes endings and beginnings are folded together—a conceptual shift that forecloses escape and demands surrender. Cost is unmistakable: loss of identity, memory, and linear time. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens when Torvald links the anomaly to his daughter’s death, raising emotional and conceptual cost. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: his counting backwards, squinting, and key-turning drive each intensification. The tightening—water flowing uphill—narrows options to one irreversible act. Cost is unmistakable: Torvald surrenders his humanity to become the “space between memory and possibility,” a trade-off charged by prior grief and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering Luc—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes there’s no “original,” only choice. Her agency drives escalation: clicking the laser chains red dots to guide the Lucs, forcing a merger. Cost is unmistakable: she must accept an ambiguous brother, sacrificing certainty for closure. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence never resolves—Dr. Voss explains but doesn’t intervene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love with disappointment—is signaled early and deepens when Mira reads the diary, forcing a trade-off between her need for moral clarity and her desire for connection. Agency drives escalation: her decision to follow scrawls, then to leave annotated pages, transforms passive mourning into active participation. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders her narrative of her father as mere failure, accepting the “lattice of love beneath the ruin.” The tightening occurs at the diary’s final entry, which crystallizes the thematic wager and narrows her options to either reject or embrace his chaotic faith in her.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to break estrangement—is signaled early and tightens through the child’s calls, culminating in the gate confrontation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to answer, to offer a lesson, to walk the tracks, and finally to let go. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing his identity as guardian of silence. The “loop” deepens from routine to existential pattern, then fractures into “direction,” satisfying Accumulative lens requirements with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when headlights flare and engines growl. The archivist’s agency drives escalation: she works faster, seals the locket, whispers the boy’s name. Cost is unmistakable—the locket’s loss, the bruised-violet ink blooming like wounds. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each added detail intensifies the covenant’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—alleviating loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled early and escalates via Kit’s agency: he initiates jokes, accepts Lila’s “moon tax,” plants seeds, and sustains the swap-meet ecosystem. The meaningful deepening occurs when rumors transform pilgrims’ behavior, raising stakes from personal ritual to communal stewardship. Cost is unmistakable: Kit’s eventual departure forfeits the haven he nurtured. Coincidence (Lila’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the solution emerges from his consistent ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens through the ring’s accumulating weight (consonants of extinct birds, vowels of unborn children). The tightening occurs when musical notes press against his ribs “asking for entry,” forcing a choice: inhale or retreat. His agency drives escalation—he chooses embodiment over avoidance—and the cost is felt in the “wet heart of silence” he seeks, now carried as “quiet blaze.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each tremor narrowing his emotional evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from noise—is signaled early and tightens when effect precedes cause, making experience “pre-threshed.” Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unbend the event, altering filaments at visible cost (station dims, gravity slackens). The deepening occurs when she realizes editing isn’t deletion but rerouting—a trade-off that forecloses certainty but enables comfort. Cost is unmistakable: power loss, physical floatation, and the burden of future loops.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating communal silence into reclaimable music—is signaled early and deepens through the advisor’s subtractive actions, each deletion narrowing the world’s noise and raising emotional stakes. Agency is clear: his signing choices directly enable the symphony, and the cost (his dissolution, the borrowed heartbeat) is felt in the town’s altered behavior by dawn. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. The tightening—from individual absences (cough, car door) to collective resonance—reweights silence as sacred resource.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a forgotten promise through understanding destruction’s dual nature—is signaled early and deepens via Ember’s realization that her arson targeted corrupted histories. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each artistic creation narrows interpretive options until the tapestry reveals the truth. The cost is conceptual (abandoning her identity as mere arsonist) and physical (the archive’s irreversible collapse). Agency is clear: her analytically intuitive decoding drives every turn, though the tightening lacks a visceral trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a personal memento).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming selfhood without erasing others—is signaled early and deepens at the lagoon, where Mira chooses harmony over extraction. Escalation is driven by her agency: drumming intensifies, then transforms into communal rhythm. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits solitude but gains purpose. The “hush of the universe” timeframe tightens decisions with poetic urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and deepens through tactile collaboration. The tightening occurs when the brass key’s sonic mechanism replaces physical locks, narrowing options to precise acoustic performance. Cost is legible: Mira abandons cartographic certainty for auditory intuition, accepting that her life’s work was fundamentally misread. Agency drives escalation—both women choose to trust inherited knowledge over technology.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness its worth—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she chooses true starlight over lantern, altering the pattern’s meaning. Pressure escalates texturally (ripples → helix → nested minnows → shimmering recognition) under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: her mute endurance, the child’s loss, and the offering of her only tool. Darkness’s transformation is earned by her precise, costly adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating thought from fixed systems—is signaled early via Mara’s coaching ethos. Escalation occurs through Mara’s agency: she organizes displays, gathers townsfolk, and initiates the “unspoken gambit.” The tightening forecloses passive resignation; cost is visible in Ellis’s bare feet, the janitor’s loose bulb, and the collective risk of curfew violation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via layered confessions until the grotto’s iron leaves lift—a cadence shift that reweights silence as power.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether the island (and its people) can redefine themselves beyond inherited violence—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s agency: her song, her push, her release of the scrimshaw. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure; cost is unmistakable in dissolving foundations and relinquished weapons. The whale’s call complicates but doesn’t resolve—Lira’s response crystallizes the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief under enforced silence—is signaled early and escalates through constrained tactics: labeling noise “dirge,” transmitting scrapes to bureaucrats. Protagonist agency drives deepening: her narration invites the officer’s participation, transforming isolation into shared ritual. Cost is visible in forfeited compliance roles and the fragile hope of resurrection. Coincidence (crow’s speech) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from carved choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rewriting boundary law through aesthetic dissolution—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she chooses phonemic inversion (“None shall stay”), risking re-freezing. Pressure tightens as ice fissures spread and quartz shifts pitch, narrowing options to perfect pronunciation. Cost is unmistakable: potential entombment as “statue of precedent” versus liberation through impermanence. Escalation follows Accumulative lens—each footfall paraphrases density, culminating in lake lifting as wings.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens through each exchange. Milo’s agency drives escalation: he searches, accepts the trade, arranges plants, presses the eye to his socket, and ultimately stops painting. Each act forecloses a path (e.g., abandoning pigment for shard-based expression) with visible cost: scarred hands, fractured vision, the kiln’s deliberate destruction. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic, culminating in a Charged Poise where brokenness becomes language.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering “the texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens when the bell ringer challenges mournful preservation. Her agency drives escalation: questioning assumptions dissolves artificial pilgrimage routes, forcing others to dismantle gear. Cost is felt in the loss of old rituals (no bells carried out) and the vulnerability of unpracticed voices. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, though the collectors’ shift feels slightly swift given their prior fixation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether memory can honor the dead without freezing them—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s actions. Her agency drives escalation: each origami placement is a deliberate act that narrows her path back to mere preservation. The cost is unmistakable: she dissolves her daughter’s last physical trace (the stencil) to create the final figure, foreclosing return. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured but not yet lived.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns before memory fades—is signaled early and tightens when she discovers the fractal debt sigil, foreclosing any singular future. Agency manifests through methodical grid-laying and path-multiplying; each action narrows interpretive options until the infinite regression emerges. Cost is unmistakable: “pockets empty of coin but full of measured silence,” and the realization that prophecy is obsolete. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s choices under Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—purifying corrupted records—is signaled early and deepens into a moral reckoning about erasure vs. preservation. The tightening occurs when she realizes purification would destroy her identity; her agency drives the exit discovery. Cost is felt: she abandons solitary authority to join survivors. “Steadily unpredictable” isn’t just motif—it’s tactical necessity against algorithmic defenses.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s unshareable shape—tightens when the stone warms, escalating from cataloguing to active fusion of timelines. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to compare reels, place the stone between projectors, and ultimately absorb it rather than drop it. Cost is unmistakable: her career ends, her body becomes archive, and the library dims. The “shadow unbound” whispering “hope was a shape that could be lost” crystallizes stakes under Accumulative pressure, with no coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding ethical care after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Miren shifts from preserving reputation to honoring failure. Agency drives escalation: her shedding layers (ring, braid, lecture) narrows options until only release remains. Cost is visceral (five corpses lined like an honor guard) and conceptual (abandoning “immaculate” identity). Coincidence complicates (the con) but resolution stems solely from her choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—releasing the displaced miracle to end cyclical grief—is signaled early and tightens when the osage reveals “Inside the spiral is the moment you lost.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to step, reopen the wound, and offer blood. Cost is unmistakable: fresh loss required, telepathy fades, and the sister’s laugh is reclaimed only through bleeding. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of botanical imagery intensifies until the miracle swells and breaks free.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost chorus to complete her mother’s goodbye—is signaled early and deepens when the film strip moves autonomously, raising the cost from passive hope to active participation. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she threads the projector, sings, scratches new lyrics. The tightening occurs when she realizes the blank letter *is* the vessel for future love, forcing a renunciation of possessive grief. Coincidence (storm, self-threading film) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to inscribe release.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—freeing stardust memory before aurora dims—is signaled early and tightens when meteors deliver the ultimatum “create, or perish.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to dismantle the telescope, transforming passive observation into active creation. Cost is unmistakable—her body dissolves, yet the price enables future artists to avoid soul-colorblindness. The aurora’s flare casting dual shadows crystallizes the core tension between earthbound limitation and cosmic potential, narrowing options to one irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspent futures through lullabies—is signaled early and tightens when phantom children appear, forcing the guard to act beyond ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to sing “through wave functions,” collapsing possibilities into pollen-children. Cost is unmistakable—“cargo once deemed lost”—and paid via his relinquishment of the clock, which now keeps divergent time without him. The Accumulative lens intensifies pressure through layered imagery (ash→leaves, sparks→lanterns) rather than causal reversals, satisfying escalation requirements for this design.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s wild frontier—is signaled early and tightens when the jaguar demands relinquishing the gear, forcing a trade-off between certainty and wonder. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses synchronization, ascent, and ultimate sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable: risking total self-unraveling (“forget her name entirely”). The forest’s “elegy for every philosopher” underscores irreversible loss, making the final barefoot return a credible endurance with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance after the leash breaks—is signaled early and tightens when the hound’s escape tangles routes. Agency lies in traversal via indirect routes, culminating in Jun’s star-stamp act, which forecloses the path of external seeking. Cost is conceptual: unused courage must be acknowledged, not found—a reweighting earned through the hound’s whimper and drooping head. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens; coincidence (howl guiding them) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the guides’ persistence earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cost of safety paid in voices—is signaled early and deepens when the bellhop transfers the bolt to the silenced boy, narrowing his own path to endurance. Agency lies in attention and presence: “he remain, motionless” becomes a tactical choice that forecloses speech but affirms continuity. Cost is unmistakable in the ledger metaphor and the fortress’s slow self-erasure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus illusion in legitimacy—is signaled early and deepens when the pretender’s forged prophecies meet the titan’s hidden map. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the titan plants clues, then intervenes directly with “Where the spine cracks, the truth leaks,” forcing the pretender’s unwitting complicity. Cost is unmistakable: the man loses not just power but self-recognition. Coincidence (stellar pause) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the sundering arises from earned contact with the rune.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—remembering what was meant to be forgotten—is signaled early and deepens when the tapping echoes from the sea, forcing Mira to choose between institutional abandonment and ancestral summons. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she interprets clues, deploys the submersible, inserts the atlas page. Cost is unmistakable: she trades documentation for stewardship, surrendering proof for faith in regrowth. The blank square “Path 27” evolves from epitaph to invitation, narrowing options to one irreversible dive.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reigniting hope during rebellion’s lull—is signaled early and deepens when the stone circle’s hum demands action. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her whistle awakens the henge; her song activates consoles; her focus ignites the pad. Cost is unmistakable: she risks curfew, militia reprisal, and personal safety to broadcast the lullaby. The tightening from passive observation to active ignition forecloses the path of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition before reconstruction fossilizes—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the guard appears, forcing Nara to act under time pressure. Agency drives escalation: decoding the kite, descending alone, grafting the embryo—all choices narrow options with visible cost (physical pain, risk of capture). The council’s off-stage pressure remains coherent; coincidence (the kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Minor deduction: the guard’s soporific pollen resolution leans slightly convenient, though mitigated by established plant telepathy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and tightened through the “freeze” exercise, which narrows perception to dissect trauma. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to map grief onto plants, then to release the photo, incurs tangible cost (loss of relic, confrontation with shrapnel-memory). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves. Final stance crystallizes not through external event but internal recalibration with felt price: “grief ends its dictatorship.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can grief be transmuted into a face that no longer exists?—is signaled immediately and tightens as the lighthouse sinks nightly, forcing Elian to act before total collapse. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for revelation but kneels, spreads shards, and actively “redesigns by untangling threads.” The cost is unmistakable: he trades survival for artistic completion, stepping into black water as the structure grinds to dust. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each environmental shift narrows time and space, culminating in a final choice that forecloses life but fulfills vision.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s crisis-slowing—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra’s journal reframes it as desert defense. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the drone, interpret symbols, and finally empty the vial. Cost is unmistakable: vanishing permanently to join pioneers. The tightening—from tracker to temporal pioneer—narrows options irreversibly under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—honest memory versus curated oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when Sera realizes even her own records were falsified. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to couple the transmitter despite knowing the council could re-freeze her “within the blink that follows surprise.” Cost is unmistakable: potential destruction of the archive she loves, yet she accepts it because “choice required risk the way thawing required heat.”

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“to weave continuity through chaos”—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s grafting act, which forecloses vengeance as an option. Pressure escalates texturally: silence grows heavier, blood-soaked earth yields forgiveness-colored blooms, and the father’s scrap becomes part of the stem. Cost is felt in her solitary labor through the night and the irreversible fusion of violent and peaceful threads. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara’s silence-weaving method forces the goddess off-balance. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: constellations bleed envy → star-goddess manifests → garden threatened → fissure created. Cost unmistakable: stellar weight lifted only after Mara voices “every unsung night.” One meaningful tightening (spike-driven fissure) narrows options decisively, altering cosmic order.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking the orbit of inherited shame—is signaled early and deepens through Cordelia’s agency: she doesn’t wait for absolution but forces contradiction via celestial journalism. Each inscription narrows options (“Assume the orbit is eternal” → curve becomes its own denial), escalating until the nib breaks under the weight of falsehood. Cost is legible: the splintered heirloom, the relinquished identity, the silent presses now roaring anew. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt through sonic restoration—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when the lab reveals it cultivates, not stores, lost sounds. Protagonist agency drives escalation: tethering amber triggers the cry; selecting RESTORE unleashes the chorus; slicing the chain enables RELEASE. Cost is unmistakable: she trades personal resolution for communal peace, foreclosing the path to self-forgiveness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in impermanence—is signaled early and tightens when Mira sprinkles the tile dust into the mandala, risking coherence for connection. Agency drives escalation: her faster fingers invent ear-canal curls, inviting silence to listen back—a bold reversal of passive waiting. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits permanence, signature, even the tile’s memory, accepting that meaning is motion, not shape. The emergent hush isn’t coincidence; it’s a coherent pressure that crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—what knowledge deserves preservation—is signaled early and deepens when Asha chooses to release memories, foreclosing her former absolutism. Pressure escalates through embodied agency: each tessera placed represents a renounced belief, narrowing her path to exile. The moral calculus sharpens at the climax (building empathy’s “armor”), with visible cost in her departure and the city’s unguided healing. Coincidence never resolves; rain merely marks time, not salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled in opening beat and deepens via protagonist agency: he doesn’t wait for rescue but flips the coin, walks the stage, ties the thread. Cost is unmistakable: Lila vanishes after their duet, leaving only a spinning thimble; he gains solidity but remains bound to ritual. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of echoes increases until they coalesce into heartbeat. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring mental privacy—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s realization that light patterns can create “dead zones.” Escalation is driven by her agency: she tests, iterates, and personalizes shields. The cost is felt in Mrs. Chen’s suffering and Mira’s exhaustion, and the stakes deepen from personal curiosity to communal salvation. Coincidence (static shock) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the solution emerges from sustained effort under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unknown before oceans erase all traces—is signaled early and tightens when the cold node interrupts gradient, forcing Aera to choose between documentation and surrender. Her agency drives escalation: pressing fossil to chest inverts heat, then vocalizing weather-sounds transforms it. Cost is unmistakable: bodily depletion (“collapsed, cheek against... floor”), loss of self (“dissolved into rumor”), and the irreversible shift from collector to conduit. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density until the fossil demands resonance over record.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mending fractured time through discarded fasteners—is signaled early and deepens via the jar’s quivering and echo release. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her classification method tightens options until silence becomes actionable wisdom. Cost is unmistakable—the cracked tower, abandoned role, emotional labor of listening to mute grief—and reweights the final choice to share rather than hoard prophecy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting proof of betrayal—is signaled early via pillbox/keycard weight. Escalation is protagonist-driven: he deciphers weather-scoured codes, bypasses dead keypad, crushes the pillbox to prevent reuse. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain (stabbing knee, bleeding), destroyed identity (crushed portrait), and certain death (expecting “bullet’s silver hush”). The “tilt toward spring” tightens tactics—thaw threatens to erase snow codes, forcing immediate action under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—distilling complexity into essence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the girl declares “the crossing will sink” upon gutter silence. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to pierce fog with needle, walk invisible plank, accept sphere. Cost is unmistakable: loss of coach, occupation, and all overwritten crossings; the sandbar’s emergence demands total narrative sacrifice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each spooled memory intensifies density until thread becomes sphere.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and deepens when Lin realizes “places resist change when no one remembers how to tend their kindness.” Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting sun patterns, shaping the clay hive, aligning fractured reflections. The cost is unmistakable—the oasis will vanish again, and Lin must carry the burden of memory alone. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each thrum intensifying the timeline fractures until kindness stitches them.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—bringing proof of sky to a caged child—is signaled early and deepens when the rose petal falls, granting “permission to speak secrets.” Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she steals the tooth, picks the lock, chooses the petal over the tool. Cost is unmistakable: the rose dies, the tooth is lost, her hidden garden risks exposure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory and rhythmic echo (oars, slosh, sighing lock) tightens the emotional vise without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens when the stone circle offers partnership at the price of self-erasure. The gryphon’s agency drives escalation: she decodes protocols, steps onto stones, then *chooses* refusal. Cost is unmistakable: the “brittle awakening” cracks further, yet admits light. The hum’s disappointment validates the stakes’ weight—coexistence demands refusal, not passive endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rejoining a world she only scripted—is signaled early and deepens when the projection’s frayed thread demands her personal offering. Her agency drives escalation: placing the twig spiral triggers the galaxy-weave, releasing her ghostwritten lines. Cost is unmistakable: the nest crumbles, her secrets scatter, and she forfeits keeper status. Coincidence (doves, rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the thread’s reweaving stems from her choice alone.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—halting cosmic manipulation of human division—is signaled early and tightens at 01:58 when the first probe hits. Lyra’s agency drives escalation: retuning, sacrificing sine wave for glacier chaos. Cost is unmistakable: physical strain (“sweat salted her lips”), emotional toll (“cautiously hopeful” tag masking exhaustion), and tactical vulnerability (SWR needle in red). Tricksters’ adaptation raises stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the Meridian Vault key—is signaled early and deepens when spatial mutiny becomes necessary. Arin’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to stay amid claustrophobic collapse, anchors the compass, steps into the shadow-circle. The trade-off is crystallized in the vision: take the key and lose the tunnels forever. Cost is unmistakable—her past selves shatter, access is sealed—and directly shapes the final image of dawn-lit rails and westward departure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy to paint the unseeable—is signaled early and deepens when the ribbon’s hair-weave demands blood sacrifice. Juniper’s agency drives escalation: her method (“unify opposites”) compels the self-inflicted wound that collapses time. Cost is unmistakable: thirty-six years of blindness, the babysitter’s cracked skull, the detective’s stored tears. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each charcoal stroke, droplet halo, and stiffening ribbon fiber tightens the emotional vise until empathy convulses awake.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased bravery—is signaled early and deepens when Voss reveals his brother’s loss, merging personal and institutional stakes. Mara’s agency drives escalation: decoding, assembling maps, launching the dirigible. Cost is felt in the temporary scar and permanent moral burden. Coincidence (Voss’s kinship) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the wreck’s location is earned through overlaid drift models.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (“sculpt possibility from ashes of ‘never’”) tightens via protagonist agency: playing reconstructs the hitchhiker, crushing the flake commits to the unknown. Pressure escalates texturally—each note adds emulsion until the flake thaws. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves her violin behind, trading known artistry for uncertain co-creation. Coincidence (hitchhiker’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her performance choices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—escaping inherited cycles of futility—is signaled early and deepens when Mara arrives, reframing failure as shared ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when they build the spiral: a collaborative act that transforms passive memory into active release. Agency drives escalation; cost is unmistakable (burning startup relics, parting ways). Under an Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density of symbolic action, not external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding inscriptions before the star dims—is signaled early and tightens when SS Lacertae’s fade becomes a “doorway.” The chronicler’s agency drives escalation: she speaks petal-syllables, places the telegram on brass, copies the inscription—all choices narrowing options (temple vanishes post-revelation). Cost is felt: her lifelong insomnia refracted into communal hope. Coincidence never resolves; stellar mechanics are consistent (19.3-hour pulse), and grief’s resistance to healing raises authentic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—confessing her betrayal to preserve the trees—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the seventh circle when the lake becomes a mirror. Briar’s agency drives escalation: stepping onto roots, pressing the seed, speaking aloud. The cost is unmistakable: her arm bound by truth-recognizing vines, her exile encoded in the orchard’s rings. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens until the gyre rewinds as consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring the eclipsed covenant between city and soil—is signaled early and tightens when the clipping tugs toward the hedge. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to reopen the scar-channel, then to let the maze graft. Cost is unmistakable: permanent rooting, loss of mobility, joining the fireflies. The “anxious elation” midpoint crystallizes pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—patching soul-holes through memory barter—is signaled early and escalates when Lira demands the irreplaceable (mother’s hum) instead of expendable sunrise memories. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn: his nod surrenders warmth for silence, costing him innocence and burdening Lira. Escalation peaks with visible price—her hollow eyes, his cool battlefield silence—and culminates in mutual transformation. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems from their choices within the orchard’s brutal economy.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—tightens decisively when Mason chooses to speak into the mic, narrowing options from retreat to re-engagement. Agency drives escalation: his repair work and vocal act stem from prior choices (keeping the cloth, opening the ledger). Cost is unmistakable: risking further ridicule to test if sound still “saves sorry souls.” The foreman’s shift from cancellation to commission proves stakes were viscerally felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reestablishing severed meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes ambitions are haunted literally, not metaphorically. Her agency drives escalation: transcribing → humming → etching the equation, each act narrowing options until the arbor resonates. Cost is unmistakable: she trades closure for her mother’s body for her pattern-as-waveform, and the new plank extends only after she accepts love’s mutable shape.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against dissolution—is signaled early (“after tomorrow disappears, the archive's catalog becomes unreliable”) and tightens when contradictions resist fusion (“fluttering against the filament like silver leaves”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she cranks her wrist, steps into surge, speaks litany, plants creel. Cost is unmistakable: “if she did not anchor them, they would scatter and grow into storms of forgetting.” The moon’s pull acts as coherent pressure, not coincidence, narrowing her window to act before “wintersun serenity” fades.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—dissolving walls between hearts—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s agency: she chooses to speak her confession, wear the crown, and stay. The escalation is driven by her decisions, not coincidence; each etched hope raises emotional stakes. The cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the surface world to become a conduit for collective grief. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, tightening from inspection to embodiment without slack or deflection.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through river logic—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Lila chooses to descend, play, immerse, recite, and release. The tightening occurs when the stream mirrors her sins via mica glints, forcing confrontation rather than avoidance. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the accordion, permanent unmedicated vulnerability, and the irreversible act of naming coordinates aloud as apology. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each beat intensifies emotional density without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unspoken words—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist-driven choices: using lies to map truth, enduring heavier watch-ballast, choosing dissolution over escape. Pressure tightens via the nine-hour window and cyclically reversed gravity, culminating in a trade-off: personal voice for collective existence. Cost is unmistakable in the final scream carried backward through history. Agency remains central; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—weighing a dream against an empire—is signaled early and deepens when the coffee stain reveals the child-emperor’s glacial tyranny. Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: interpreting stains, heeding the cereus, choosing to play. The moral calculus sharpens—silence preserves provenance but evaporates hope; playing unravels destiny but starves the empire. Cost is unmistakable: collapsed violin, failed harvests, her own exhaustion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with “propagate” acting as both command and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when she sees her aged reflection in the emerald, realizing she must give herself. This deepening reweights the entire endeavor from preservation to sacrifice. Agency is clear: she chooses dissolution, trading her name for 342 sparks. Cost is unmistakable in the empty studio and her dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment—is signaled early and deepens into a moral reckoning with debt, grief, and rebirth. Pressure tightens when the grotto denies epiphany and the boy begins to dissipate, forcing the caretaker’s decisive act (stabbing the hairpin). This protagonist-driven escalation forecloses escape and reorients direction toward wound-tending. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s absence, the sister’s guilt, the valley’s burden—all crystallized in the relic’s pulse beneath bone.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—moral unease vs. professional certainty—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira offers the geologist the choice to “stand here naked with the truth.” This protagonist-driven escalation narrows options: maintain lies or embrace vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable—the team forfeits their protective certainty, risking careers, while Mira bears their grief unpaid. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transmitting forbidden knowledge without collapsing possibility—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s withholding. The deepening occurs when Marcus sees his own reverse aging, raising stakes from intellectual inheritance to existential participation. Agency is clear: Elara chooses timing, method, and student; Marcus endures the cost of delayed understanding. Pressure escalates texturally via ripple revelations, each narrowing interpretive options until the fourth ring reconfigures everything with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens through Cael’s harmonic interaction with the canyon. His agency lies in choosing stillness over pursuit, which forecloses all prior paths with visible cost: rooted feet, merged identity, eternal residence among bone and dust. Pressure escalates texturally (density of echoes, flock patterns, resonant frequencies) until the final image reweights “home” as internal alignment rather than destination.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unquantified wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the spire’s algorithms begin “sealing the air into glass.” Elian’s agency drives escalation: his confession stabilizes the stair; his badge-wrapping actively hides the keystone’s light. Cost is visible: exile, invisibility, loss of guild access. One tightening suffices—a single, high-stakes choice that reweights his entire existence—but the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure compared to internalized conflict alone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering sound’s color—is signaled early and deepens into understanding vows as luminous survival. Jin’s agency drives escalation: he abandons his ladder, dives, navigates drowned shelves, and plays the cylinder. Cost is legible in his irreversible transformation—post-dive, his ritual is irrevocably altered, and sailors perceive the lights as singing. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each lantern reflection, book, and plankton hue intensifies the central question without digression.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—wavelength alignment with purpose—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes alignment requires sacrifice of self. Escalation is driven by her agency: casting stones, arranging coins, swallowing the spiral. Cost is unmistakable—heat drawn from her skin, identity erased—and charges the final harmonic state. The inward spiral pattern crystallizes pressure, forcing renunciation over passive waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—naming the nameless fear—is signaled early and deepens into confronting his own unworthiness. The tightening occurs when the atlas boat forms the question “What was sacrificed for you?” which narrows his options to acknowledgment or denial; he chooses the former at great cost. His agency drives every escalation: tracing the tentacle, shattering cylinders, folding paper souls. The visible price—carrying unread letters of unlived years in his ribcage—charges the final image with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding belief-driven ocean—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Kael chooses brittle devotion over grand magic, then teaches children to count. Pressure tightens when drip-rate accelerates, but true escalation is communal adoption of ritual after his death—agency transfers without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: Kael’s life spent as keeper; ocean’s fragility persists (“one drought of belief…”). Under Accumulative lens, each doubling drip narrows the path to collective maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving dignity of the drowned past—is signaled early and deepens when Marisol confronts her father’s alternate life. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow, gather, release, and reframe. Cost is unmistakable: private grief surrendered for communal healing. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via layered revelations, each narrowing emotional options until the final renunciation feels inevitable yet costly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the starlings deliver coordinates, forcing a trade-off: trust pattern over thermometer. The deepening occurs at the firelit revelation of orchard history, which raises the cost from personal doubt to ontological risk (“unravel the seam between knowable and known”). Agency drives escalation: she *chooses* to lower the crystal into flame despite logic’s warning. The minor seventh hum and indigo horizon impose a live clock that crystallizes her stance without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust in a compromised network—is signaled early and tightens when the stolen signal appears. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her decision to descend, then offer the buckle, reweights the entire system. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her identity as sole watcher, exposing herself to potential betrayal. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of coded gestures and embodied protocols intensifies until the anomaly forces reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—custody via emotional authenticity—is signaled early and escalates through rounds of confession that narrow options (loser dissolves). Mara’s agency drives climax: she breaks ritual by pouring fluid over joined hands, accepting cost of merged identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each memory deepens neural glow until Zero’s silence cracks. The rewrite clock (“seventh time that week”) tightens tactics; history’s flux makes permanence precious.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for innovation—is signaled early and deepens when the seed demands the labyrinth rewrite itself. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for thunderclaps but actively redirects growth via brass levers, turning threat into clue. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits control, becoming part of the system. The tightening occurs when roots thread “orthogonal angles,” forcing realignment of doorways—a physical manifestation of her philosophical surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens when the tunnel transforms engine noise into Quinn’s giggle. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Ellery modulates throttle to coax sound, choosing vulnerability over silence. Cost is unmistakable: emotional shredding (“heart macerated”), physical kneeling, and the irreversible surrender of hope for literal return. The tightening forecloses denial, forcing him to accept echo as vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making friends with uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens through the nightly ritual, culminating in the charged poise at the threshold. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes friendship means “standing at the threshold long enough to feel the draft of both sides,” which narrows options: crossing would betray her method. Cost is unmistakable—the pendant left behind, evidence erased—and escalation is driven by her agency (choosing retreat over passage). Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—interrupting destiny through creative destruction—is signaled early and tightens when the alchemist pours blood, then ash, escalating personal cost. Agency drives every escalation: his successive approximations narrow failure until vivification demands blindness. The creature’s emergence forces a Charged Poise: he accepts a “stranger cage,” crystallizing stance with conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—tuning the shard before it consumes all transmission—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: she discards assumptions, inserts the fragment, adjusts the dial. Each act narrows options (rejecting noise-as-silence, gold-as-metal) and deepens knowledge (hearing the “heartbeat of carrier wave”). The cost is unmistakable: sublimating the fragment into “pure photon” erases a relic of human arrogance, and her lighter coat embodies loss. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—density intensifies until silence itself becomes generative, not destructive.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving half-erased commuters by merging timelines—is signaled early and escalates when the hull flickers and grotto closes. Arden’s agency drives every turn: he interprets barnacle coordinates, steers by heartbeat rhythm, and chooses which timeline to sacrifice. The price is unmistakable: irreversible loss of one reality, embodied in the hourglass burning “hope through his coat.” Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a high-cost, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping connection’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: each stitch alters reality, escalating until she becomes the thread itself. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens; the tightening occurs when the composite man dissolves, revealing she’s not outside the system. Cost is unmistakable: her identity collapses into the work (“she was the thread, the pattern, the space between”), paid via loss of separateness. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from her weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate in a folded cosmos—is signaled early and tightens when the boy asks if they can return, forcing the instructor to confront the emotional cost of truth. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to teach edge geometry, to stay with the boy, to give him the link. The price is legible: her smile is “thin,” the city dims, the anchor’s absence aches “like lungs remembering air.” Coincidence (leviathan craft) complicates but doesn’t resolve—it validates the method, raising stakes for belief.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—protecting erased voices—tightens when Mira chooses to upload the ledger over preserving evidence, forcing Hask’s reckoning. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her curiosity → tracing → confrontation → upload. Cost is unmistakable: triggering alarms, risking career, and bearing witness to Hask’s collapse. Coincidence (finding Lila’s photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Mira’s decisive upload and lie.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly: each spoken name thins the gold, deepens immersion, and risks total dissolution. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency (naming, touching, descending), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where density of auroral scars reweights the cost of forgetting. The trade-off is clear: personal safety versus restoring voice to those phase-shifted into rumor. Final cost is conceptual yet visceral—the burden of memory replacing claustrophobic dread.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—survival as a bureaucratic anomaly—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: the ink-map revelation that reframes “error” as corridor. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to defragment through ink, drawing the new ring, confronting the clerk. Cost is unmistakable: existence hinges on systemic fragility, and the price is perpetual impermanence (“wet footprints that match no living pair”). Coincidence (printer jam) complicates but does not resolve; resolution arises from stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—saving a dead language through texture-to-sound translation—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly: each step into the tunnel raises bodily cost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation; she chooses silence over safety, then life over silence. The curse doesn’t rage—it seeps, syncing with her slowing heart to extract clearer phonemes, making price and progress one. Final trade (“one life for many voices”) crystallizes under pressure with irreversible, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—turning bitterness into cosmic meaning—is signaled early and deepens through agency: Mara chooses to stay, question, climb. Escalation is driven by her decisions under Accumulative pressure (confessions, warming arrowhead, rotating flowers). Cost is unmistakable: her body cracks open, human identity shed. The moth-creature doesn’t resolve—it offers memory; Mara acts, fusing flint to palm.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty before calcification—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Calla plays the lullaby backward, risking statue detection. Agency drives escalation: her arrhythmic signaling creates the hesitation enabling advancement. Cost is unmistakable: she uproots the seed knowing it may freeze her in place, and indeed, the orchard’s transformation demands her departure—beauty “travels on its own legs.” Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her musical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reuniting severed promises—is signaled early and deepens when the game speaks in his mother’s voice, transforming abstract mission into visceral reckoning. Riven’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to uncork the storm, feed tokens to a non-game machine, and trade weather for words. The cost is unmistakable—the letters were always there, devoured by borders—and his actions reroute history at personal risk, crystallizing stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes intensify coherently under the Accumulative lens: the search for the halo fragment deepens into a confrontation with silence itself, narrowing options until only song-through-memory remains. The carpenter’s agency drives every turn—his wrong turn, his touch, his internal “singing”—and each choice forecloses retreat into mute craftsmanship. Cost is unmistakable: his throat aches with “a lifetime of swallowed words,” and the final chord sinks into his chest “not as power but as promise,” implying ongoing vulnerability. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accrues through texture and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories gestate—is signaled early and deepens when Ms. Penumbra realizes she collapses “wave function of possibility.” Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing spines, stepping through angles, folding spacetime via scarf. Cost is unmistakable: she births others’ futures while remaining anonymous, her labor legible only as “shiver of inspiration.” Hyperbolic geometry isn’t coincidence—it’s the causal engine generating narrative gravity that pulls her deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the cipher to restore erased voices—intensifies through Mireya’s agency: she chooses to risk unnamed memory, steps into the tide, and snaps the decisive frame. Pressure escalates texturally (light imploding, air thinning) until the dream’s capture reweights all stakes. Cost is visceral: palette cracks, colors rush through veins, and she becomes “the gap between heartbeats.” Coincidence complicates (horizon as shy animal) but resolution stems solely from her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is signaled in the first line and deepens via protagonist agency: she chooses the third gate, offers her DNA-ribbon, cuts the mirror. Each escalation narrows options (gates vanish post-act; years erase with steps) and raises cost (name loss, swallowed words becoming flood). The tightening is decisive: confession without language forces innovation (hair as key), and the final trade—surrender name, keep longing—is unavoidable under the Accumulative lens. Coincidence (Vega’s position) complicates but never resolves; all turns stem from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes they were *offered*, not taken. The tightening occurs at the sextant: she must choose between final forgetting or painful remembrance. Her agency drives escalation—studying constellations, slicing the mushroom—and the cost is unmistakable: re-enduring loss. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory layering (cider, rust, accordion) until the decisive renunciation crystallizes stakes. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her chronic curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when the tea leaves demand Lira become “its next text.” Her agency drives escalation: she seals clauses by circling the cup, rewriting exile into a loop. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her own return so the child may remember. The library’s shudder and falling page confirm pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves, only ritualized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—saving wonder’s color—tightens decisively when Arin realizes hoarding fails; he must release droplets, sacrificing control for transmission. This deepening arises from protagonist agency (his lullaby-weaving invites hues, then his insight reframes the loom as shuttle). Cost is unmistakable: the loom buckles, willow cracks, and his orchard-tending life ends—but laughter erupts across the gorge. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each dawn’s pruning builds toward the seventh morning’s climactic choice, where stakes shift from preservation to propagation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing silenced spirits—is signaled early and deepens through knot-untying that releases layered stories. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency: each knot undone raises emotional density and narrows his role from restorer to exhumator. Cost is felt in the “accumulated silence” lifting only after labor. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as language—is signaled early and deepens when footage reveals the door’s impossible shift. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she compares reels, notices the lightning-aligned frame, presses her palm to stone. The cost is visible: dead projectors, abandoned documentation, and the irreversible choice to “not translate” what she heard. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sensory and temporal layers reweights the stake without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—tightens when variables “refuse to balance,” forcing Mara to confront buried ancestry (1914). The escalation is protagonist-driven: her confession triggers the Electra’s surrender, transforming static suspension into release. Cost is unmistakable—the dissolving notebook, Elias’s lingering absence, the “quietly, irrevocably lighter” solver—and the final act (tipping the globe) forecloses hoarding truth. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each corrosion note, magnesium flake, and spine dissolution deepens the inevitability of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken needs before thunder erases them—is signaled early and tightens when the echo accuses, “You're encoding us away,” forcing Lyra to choose between preservation and release. This deepening shifts her agency from containment to dissemination, with visible cost: she abandons the bolt plate’s protective function. The escalation is driven entirely by Lyra’s choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, and the final image reweights the stake: needs are not owned but shared. The “razor-thin measure” of time between lightning and thunder imposes relentless pressure that narrows every action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the captain smiled while falling—tightens into cultivating joy amid grief, with clear escalation: cipher → map → seed. Protagonist agency drives every turn; wind and gusts complicate but never resolve (the door slam merely triggers what Lira’s arrangement made possible). Cost is legible: she forfeits her position, trades silver, endures cold, and commits to an uncertain future. The apricot tree’s survival hinges on trace heat from coal ash—a credible, small-scale price that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving clouds hold memory—is signaled early and tightens as the cable snaps wire by wire. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she actively logs emotions, threads filament, releases kites. Each act narrows survival options while deepening proof. Cost is unmistakable: her fall ensures dissemination. The Accumulative lens intensifies via cadence shifts—shorter sentences as wires pop—and the final lurch crystallizes stakes without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the unseen essence of human presence before erasure—is signaled early and intensifies through the protagonist’s deepening understanding of her craft. Pressure escalates via external threat (demolition) and internal revelation (painting negative space), culminating in a decisive act: embedding the coin’s pattern into the wall as memory. The cost is felt—she sacrifices personal attachment to faces for universal preservation—and visible in her departure without looking back. Agency drives every turn; no resolution relies on luck.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing the ship’s fade into oblivion—is signaled early via dimming lamps and “forgetting why she flew.” Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: her observation → transcription → recitation sequence deepens pressure until the chief engineer demands “a tale bright enough to burn.” The cost is felt in near-total darkness and sociable isolation; resolution requires her to risk voice and vulnerability. Coincidence (starlings mirroring spirals) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is her deliberate act of reading.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair to mend cosmic and cardiac disarray—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the mirror door. Rowan’s agency drives escalation: his observation of asynchronous reflections leads to the key’s restoration, narrowing options from despair to collaboration. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits return (door vanishes) and assumes eternal custodianship. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—no coincidence resolves; every turn stems from his perception and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the orchards through collective action—is signaled by the dying arches and tightens via the eclipse deadline. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her chalked messages force choices that narrow options (e.g., “one ladder alone tilts the sky” demands interdependence). Cost is unmistakable: her tether loosens only after proving she “needed them, loved them still” through labor. The paradox of “brambled hope” sharpens stakes—sweetness that stings—making the final coordinated harvest feel both necessary and precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—silencing the doomsday clock’s tick—is signaled early and deepens through each lullaby iteration, narrowing options until only self-erasure remains. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her whispered recursions directly cause the clock’s retreat. Cost is unmistakable: “she would remain here, voice eternally whispering,” with villages saved but her existence forfeited. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each song tightens the hush until midnight shudders backward.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before frost—is signaled early and escalates coherently under Accumulative pressure. Mara’s agency lies in attention and impression-making; each warmth-ghost narrows options for the lost while ratcheting her own risk. The mechanical bird’s near-detection and limping traveler’s hesitation deepen tension without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: her prints freeze into fossils, sealing her isolation as the price of their survival.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into resonance—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the chrysalis is a mold, not emptiness. Escalation is driven by her agency: observing foam → synthesizing resin → embedding laughter → installing sculptures. Cost is unmistakable: her cleanroom obsession caused her to miss the final call, and her atonement requires surrendering control (the sculptures operate without her). Coincidence (wind stealing ashes) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—quantifying absence to map story origins—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: each sale deepens narrative gravity until the orchard sags and clouds fracture. The tightening is decisive: pricing shifts to “seconds of unlived time,” forcing patrons to confront unmade choices. Cost is unmistakable—librarian loses index-memory, vendor erases herself—and forecloses paths (no return to pre-transaction equilibrium). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of absences reweights the world’s physics.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—relieving accumulated sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when Marisol realizes the desert wants acknowledgment, not erasure. Her agency drives escalation: kneeling to read sand, descending stairs, pressing palms into coral. Cost is unmistakable: her gift permanently changes, trading extraction for circulation. The tightening occurs at the pavilion threshold—human sorrow meets oceanic grief—and forces a trade-off: absorb or reciprocate. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring communication between sky-measured time and soil-measured worth—is signaled early and deepens when the elevator demands a bridge. Mireya’s agency drives escalation: her language-braiding forces a trade-off (exhaustion for harmony). Cost is unmistakable: her glittering apron, the “missing rib” of silence, the elevator’s threat of rot. The tightening forecloses isolation, making shared custodianship the only viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting entangled dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Mara risks motor overwrite for resonance. Escalation is driven by her agency: calibrating the helmet, injecting neurotrophin, raising her hand. Cost is unmistakable: near-death, shattered engines, bleeding scalp. The moon’s movement applies coherent external pressure, but resolution hinges on her internal calibration—a high-stakes trade-off between memory and selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing forgotten combinations before inversion ends—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the thirty-one-minute clock. Escalation is driven by Ilyra’s agency: fracturing vision to bypass a kernel, chanting then whispering to manage vigilance seeds. Cost is unmistakable—the doodle’s ink bleeds, its purpose spent; time loss forces sprinting through unstable thresholds. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of risk compounds without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving silenced song—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Ilay doesn’t wait for inspiration but methodically maps cracks, then plays them into melody. The tightening occurs when she discovers the siskin-wing fracture, transforming passive observation into active invocation. Cost is felt in her slowed heartbeat matching “arboreal time” and physical toll (“knees trembling”). Coincidence never resolves; every escalation stems from her symphonic choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—teaching beauty in difficulty—is signaled early and deepens when the tutor realizes his exile is a transposition, not an end. The meaningful tightening occurs when silence resolves into teachable patterns, forcing him to act before the next phase. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits passive mourning for active risk, trading safety for the chance to teach “one final student.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves his dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cataloging silence to teach the world empathy—tightens decisively when Mirelle shifts from collecting labels to broadcasting the clasp’s frequency. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each dial turn is a choice that narrows options (darkness, specific frequencies) and deepens knowledge. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits possession of the clasp, risking its misuse, to enable others’ healing. The live clock (“seconds before explosions”) forces urgency without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating “serenity within motion”—tightens when the seed’s rot must be precise enough to fuse but not attract pollinators, forcing Myrrh to stitch blind to scent. This deepening narrows options: she breathes through her mouth to mute olfactory storm, sacrificing sensory advantage for control. Cost is felt in her journal entry (“I sway inside the sway”) and culminates in relinquishing the notebook. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves—only the forest’s pulse and her mother’s silent ascent complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering resilience’s source—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when gravity inverts, forcing Aera to act within an hour. Her agency drives escalation: reading water currents, leaping branches, inserting the arrow tip. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders private memories (first crash, mother’s harvest) to the archive, altering her internal landscape. The sapling’s “prism of every hardship outlived” crystallizes stakes without abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the “next city from going silent”—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the port stores/replays sound predictively. Her agency drives escalation: documenting wind patterns leads to backward writing, which realigns the maze. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices forward motion (walking backward), bears emotional weight (“patch pulse against her heart”), and accepts isolation as the sole listener. The tightening—from surveyor to oracle—narrows her options to one resonant act: leaving reverse silhouettes as warnings, foreclosing normalcy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled by breath-chords shattering under Council threat. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elian chooses to enter Vein, kneel to ice-piano, swallow the score. Cost is legible in closure—he abandons archival validation for embodied testimony, trading institutional legitimacy for existential risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each auroral layer strips protective scales, narrowing options until only ingestion remains.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding why the flute mocked intent—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes “the flaw had never been the melody but the singer’s fear dressed as certainty.” This insight forces a trade-off: pursue ancestral knowledge or accept stillness. Agency drives escalation—her breath through the flute triggers the spiral’s formation, which reconfigures the fault. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the relic and the identity it represented, leaving “without the object she had guarded” yet carrying “the newfound hush inside her.”

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether empathy requires self-annihilation—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Quince realizes borrowed lives erode his lattice until only longing remains. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to feed the astronomer’s strip into the ink-duct, then to place the child of light on the platen. The cost is unmistakable: scattering every borrowed soul, enduring blankness “perfectly weightless and suddenly terrifying.” The press’s backward turn isn’t luck—it’s a renunciation that forecloses his old method forever.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder in a world preferring certainty—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant vibrates, escalating to the existential demand that Elias “become the message.” The tightening occurs when the stranger reveals Corwin’s intentional fade, foreclosing Elias’s path as mere courier. Cost is felt: he surrenders personal memory for mythic function. Escalation is driven by artifact response and dialogue, not coincidence, though Elias’s agency in the climax leans passive.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and deepens when the car becomes a reliquary, not a prison. Elian’s agency drives escalation: each lie tests the prism’s truth-rejection, culminating in the admission “I need you still,” which cracks the hush and returns sound. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits the prism (his sister’s surrogate) to achieve repositioned grief, narrowing his path from possession to release.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early (“yarn itself wanted to speak”) and tightens when the puzzle demands voice-as-currency. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to crush/swallow the bead, converting voice to golden thread. Cost is unmistakable: loss of name, laughter reduced to wind-rumor, permanent muteness. The trade-off (voice for connection) crystallizes under coherent pressure—silence isn’t passive but actively woven into maps, with stakes deepening from wistful note to rewound time.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resilience amid ruin—is signaled early and tightens through Thistle’s nightly labor, which forecloses social acceptance for visionary risk. Agency is clear: he chooses the mines over the forge, silk over steel, ascent over retreat. Cost accumulates (isolation, physical toll), and the seventh-night turn—arches singing—emerges from his persistent action, not coincidence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the villagers’ shift from confusion to wonder lacks individualized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she presses the shard, steps through the loom, pries open the locker. Each action narrows options: touching the younger self fails, forcing redirection; swallowing the cube commits her to irreversible knowledge. Cost is unmistakable: she learns she funded the cover-up, weaponizing her own craft. Escalation follows Accumulative pressure—filaments accumulate in her nerves until the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—keeping the chain unbroken against forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp dies prematurely, raising fear of the keeper’s disappearance. Elias’s agency manifests through attention and ritual: building two cairns, bottling the glass, rowing backward. The escalation is driven by his perception (“lamp coughed twice”) and response, not coincidence. Cost is felt in “apology for lives he reached too late” and the widow’s pink granite stone—each choice narrows emotional options toward Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake—steering night without birthing dawn—tightens when Lirael’s accidental prophecy forces her to accept that shaping dawn *requires* consuming shadow. Escalation is driven by her agency: each laugh deepens commitment and exacts visible cost (erased stars, consumed wick). The black flame and dark sail aren’t coincidence but consequences of her choices under Accumulative pressure. Final trade-off—her identity as herald for reader—is crystallized with undeniable cost: the wick vanishes, the lighthouse dissolves, yet she walks inland sowing prophecies, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding narrative magnetism—is signaled early and tightens when the heart beats faster at sun alignment, forcing Hoshiko to engage the wing as catalyst. Her agency drives escalation: pressing, pouring, painting, folding. Cost is conceptual yet legible—the collector’s life spent chasing a truth he almost grasped, now entrusted to her. No coincidence resolves tension; revelation emerges from her disciplined observation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring vs. witnessing grief—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes trees tally human calculations. The tightening occurs at the pin-drop: a silent corridor becomes the locus of unresolved sorrow, forcing her to deconstruct rather than recalibrate. Agency is clear: she chooses to speak rings aloud, softening brass into wood. Cost is felt—emotional labor, the weight of ancestral grief—but never abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm through recovered song—is signaled early and tightens when the keeper realizes “every mirror refused to reflect another’s light,” forcing a tactical pivot from solo lullaby to communal canon. Escalation is driven by her agency: singing → fracturing mica → shouting her name → inviting reflections to sing each other’s verses. Cost is unmistakable: blood loss, memory bleed, and permanent bodily fusion with mica. Night’s resistance (“tarry vines”) compounds pressure without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unearthing wisdom in her mistake—is signaled early and deepens when she rereads the invitation’s phrase “bring the gift of absence,” now understood as perilous. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: kneeling instead of fleeing, pouring her presence into paper. The tightening occurs at midnight’s purge, forcing her ultimate choice. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits corporeal existence, becoming “woman-shaped hush.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of latent emotions, ticking clock, Vale’s approach—all narrow options toward sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against creeping normality—is signaled early and escalates through Mila’s agency: she chooses not to eat, then plants, then becomes gardener. Each guerrilla act narrows options (commuters step around shoots but linger), raising emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: tenuous absolution requires constant tending, and reopening demands vulnerability (“bell rang like a confession”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—measuring the last frequencies of human virtue—is signaled early and tightens as each vow decays, forcing quicker, riskier measurements. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to strike the flint, sample mercy despite its pain, record stewardship’s ultraviolet ghost. Each loss forecloses a path (loyalty’s static, mercy’s blood), culminating in Wonder’s shattering—a trade-off where truth extraction destroys the instrument. Cost is unmistakable: physical injury, irreversible data loss, and the quiet horror of witnessing meaning evaporate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing trust breaking—is signaled early and tightens as dawn approaches. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her false starts, heartbeat recording, and imagined rescues all narrow options until surrender becomes inevitable. Cost is unmistakable: the truce dissolves, love is unmasked as weight mistaken for connection. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems solely from her internal fracture and the ticking fob’s symbolic deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding weather-carriers—tightens when the skeptic confronts her own atmospheric identity, foreclosing her skeptical methodology. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the ring, descend the bluff, accept convergence. Cost is legible in the branded palm and surrendered doubt. Coincidence (the waiting woman) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the skeptic’s acceptance is her own act.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling inherited memory with creative legacy—is signaled early and deepens when the mother’s self-portrait dissolves into storm. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she pins the parchment, draws wings, and collaborates, each act narrowing her path back to solitary portraiture. Cost is felt in cracked nails, clean fingers (loss of old identity), and the irreversible shift from restoring to co-creating. The lock’s opening releases sound, not freedom—a trade-off where healing requires surrendering control over memory’s form.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—candor as survival—is signaled early (“ink began to feel like a lie”) and escalates through Aurelia’s tactile rejection of deceit. Her decision to seek lost conversations forecloses safety (curfew violation) and material security (abandoning gold foil), with cost legible in blistered skin and trembling hands. The tightening at the cathedral—choosing to stay and read aloud—narrows options to endurance with visible price: breath spent on words when rations are scarce. Coincidence (finding Corin) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s “color”—is signaled early and deepens via the comet’s rare arrival, which forces final calibration under time pressure. Agency is clear: the tuner’s adjustments narrow options (e.g., locking the ice with a pin “no thicker than a tuning fork’s tongue”) and incur cost (thirty silent years, emptied pockets). Escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence; the comet complicates but doesn’t resolve—the sculpture’s song emerges from her precise labor. Felt price (“iceberg shrinking to a pearl of memory”) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the farm through controlled chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the box resists miniaturization, forcing K-17 to choose between protocol and emotional truth. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: opening the box, merging with it, walking into the burn zone. Cost is unmistakable—the android forfeits its original form to become the seed’s heart. Magnetic timing creates a live clock that narrows options until the final decisive act of holding the box open to flames.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving listening heals—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from collecting evidence to practicing witness. Pressure escalates through neighborhood testimony, each voice tightening the mystery until the mailbox’s pulse demands a stance, not a solution. Agency lies in renunciation: she chooses not to force entry, paying the cost of unresolved curiosity for communal catharsis. Coincidence (locket sighting) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Mira’s crystallized ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—encrypting human weakness as future strength—is signaled early and tightens when Mara swallows the seed, accepting irreversible embodiment. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: decoding, rolling dice, surrendering to current. Cost is unmistakable: the lab’s self-drowning, the archive’s fragility, the political weaponization avoided at mortal price. Coincidence (spider’s timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the dice compass is earned through prior trust.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased memories—is signaled early and deepens through Miren’s discovery that memories return only as sensation, not narrative. The tightening occurs when the gravity point collapses: she cannot grasp the firefly-memories, accepting their ephemerality. Cost is visible in the crumbled flowers and spent pigment, altering her tactics from retrieval to dispersal. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (whale beaching) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the ritual succeeds through her deliberate acts.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—hushing a contagious prophecy—is signaled early and escalates organically: from babies crying in binary to drumbeats in cricket legs. The summoner’s agency drives every turn: mapping silence, stepping into water, speaking the inverse word. Cost is visceral—he ingests the threat, binding it permanently to his body. Pressure tightens under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a decisive reweighting where silence becomes active containment, not mere absence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transcending loneliness through shared language—is signaled early and deepens when the tutor reveals her summoned nature. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to “interrogate” the gargoyle triggers the building’s confession, which catalyzes the tutor’s dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting unspoken stories and eternal vigilance (“we will crumble together”). The tightening forecloses the student role, forcing assumption of teacherhood with architectural weight as price.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a quarantined memory—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara chooses to hum, kneel, press palms to earth. Escalation is driven by her decisions under pressure, culminating in irreversible cost (grayscale vision). The three-note lullaby tightens options by binding past/present, and the Bureau’s off-page presence maintains coherent antagonistic pressure without resolution by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forgiving the unfinished—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses self-script over forgery. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each memory deepens her realization that calibrated treason corrupted her. Cost is unmistakable (“become the very monster”) and culminates in relinquishing her talisman. Minor deduction: regime-toppling occurs off-page, slightly softening external stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—escaping involuntary echo—is signaled early and deepens when the canyon questions Lira directly, raising existential pressure. The tightening occurs when she recognizes her mother’s voice in the cocoon, forcing a trade-off: perpetuate legacy or finish it. Agency drives escalation—her decision to sing the missing cadence, not luck, resolves the loop. Cost is felt: she inherits silence as currency, not just peace. The old woman’s revelation (“you learned to finish”) crystallizes the stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—salvaging “something pure”—tightens when Marrow realizes cameo faces are threads in a tapestry, raising the cost from retrieval to translation. Her agency drives escalation: three nights in the shrine, pressing palms until skin sticks, following jellyfish-memories deeper. The glacier’s silence forces her to interpret, not command, making the final hymn a hard-won reciprocity. Cost is felt in passengers dissolving into glitter—a visible forfeiture for the knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens when the whisk’s inscription mirrors her walked spiral, transforming personal mourning into cosmic alignment. Agency is subtle but decisive: her whistle alters the oarsman’s course, proving invisible acts ripple outward. Cost is felt in the fireflies’ extinction and the nets’ inevitable re-tearing, yet she endures. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—only pattern recognition tightens meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unearthing the Coalition’s lies—is signaled early and deepens when Marisol realizes the diamond forces perfect memory, not misfortune. Her agency drives escalation: humming the sign-off tone, threading the diamond on root fiber. Cost is unmistakable: she chooses enduring shame over amnesia, and the orchard’s accelerated decay mirrors her internal reckoning. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each reassembled fragment tightens the moral vise.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn through ancient shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the backward lullaby offers temporal coordinates, forcing Elara to choose between self-preservation and prophetic erasure. Escalation is driven by her agency: she downloads, interprets lyrics, walks toward the portico. Cost is unmistakable: “become the darkness others flee,” paid when she hits enter and dissolves. The moral calculus—better nightmares for better realities—sharpens the peak choice without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory before it dissolves—is signaled early and deepens when the child requests ancestral sound. Posy’s escalation is agentic: she opens the rusted box (foreclosing passive waiting) and pours voices into it, paying the cost of vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density—gull-cries, pulse, whispered hope—until the box clicks shut. Coincidence never resolves; the child’s arrival is consequence, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting Port Viburnum from solidified nightmares via the Echo—is signaled early and tightens when the bone cracks, forcing Mireya into a triadic choice: save artifact (lose town), abandon it (feed nightmares), or invent a third way. Her agency drives escalation: she changes bowing tempo, syncs heartbeat to glacier time, then reweaves vibration to invite listening. Cost is unmistakable: calving ice threatens the town even as she acts, and the key’s transformation marks irreversible sacrifice. Pressure coheres entirely through Accumulative/Textural intensification—each note deepens the sonic field until resolution emerges from resonance itself.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—launching revolution at the exact magnetic inflection—is signaled early and tightens via Elian’s nightly mappings. The skew in moon path and deepening hum force a trade-off: act now or lose the window. Cost is legible in the compass’s surrender and the silent lantern signal—agency resides in attention, not violence, and the price is permanent disconnection from old timekeeping.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking cycles of coercive control—is signaled early and deepens when Mara recognizes her father’s role. The journal discovery narrows options: silence or exposure. Cost is legible in trembling hands and reconfigured stance. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (searching, interpreting marks), though the commissioner’s off-page death slightly softens antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—securing a second opinion for Rowan—is signaled early and tightens when Olya declares machines don’t appeal their sentence, forcing Emil to shift from prayer to action. The deepening occurs when he produces Rowan’s list, transforming contrition into tangible intervention. Agency drives escalation: Emil chooses to spend sacred funds and leak evidence, incurring institutional and spiritual risk. Cost is unmistakable—the chaplain still must stand at the gurney, now bearing truth’s burden alongside ritual duty.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and deepens when the clapper is revealed missing, forcing Juniper to invent a new method. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting the kaleidoscope, descending despite risk, using the arrow as stylus then striker. Cost is unmistakable: the glider’s degradation, the irreversible commitment to a frequency no one else yet hears. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each permutation tightens the yearning until “Descend” crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus corporate erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the keeper discovers her mother’s hologram, transforming abstract justice into intimate restitution. Agency drives escalation: her lie initiates access, her touch triggers exposure, her song broadcasts truth. Cost is unmistakable: loss of job, identity, and official existence. The AI’s staged crash raises stakes from missing persons to systemic fraud, narrowing options until only sacrificial remembrance remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the border between memory and void—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes the Keeper fragmented himself to avoid feeling. Her agency drives escalation: feeding sorrow, stepping through the mirror, swallowing her own empathy. The cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her trained calm, risks entrapment, and permanently alters the keeper’s covenant. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens when Mara abandons spectatorship for participation, foreclosing her original path with visible cost (she never boards Solace). Escalation is driven by agency: volunteering, listening, then actively subverting the mercy ritual by offering tea. The boy’s near-boarding creates peak pressure, resolved not by coincidence but by Mara’s deliberate sonic cue. Stakes remain viscerally felt through tactile and auditory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming possibility against declared impossibility—is signaled early and deepens when Marco reinterprets the families’ verdict as error, not fate. His agency drives escalation: speaking aloud, planning graft, writing a new note. Cost is legible in the “ghost of fire” on his thumb and the vacant station’s silence—a lifetime of waiting made visceral. The single tightening (from passive sentinel to active cultivator) forecloses resignation with tangible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving uncorrupted wisdom—is signaled early and deepens through the walker’s method: approaching without hunger, consecrating through peripheral awareness. Escalation occurs via environmental response (parapet thrumming, whispers dimming), culminating in the clearing’s manifestation as a cognitive space. The cost is felt in his scarred face and the burden of perpetual line-walking. Agency is clear: his choices (three circuits, oblique focus) directly enable stabilization, avoiding coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transmuting communal pain into shared beauty—is signaled early and tightens when grandchildren arrive, forcing the archivist from private ritual to public witness. Agency lies in attention and arrangement; her micro-choices (rotating photos, pressing the key) narrow options toward the dove configuration. Cost is felt in the solitude preceding arrival and the vulnerability of exposure. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening: the shift from collection to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding silence before language vanishes—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when the crystal demands testimony. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to speak, triggering the library’s response. Cost is felt in her irreversible surrender of control (“She had done it to witness”). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sonic density, not external threat, culminating in a resonant trade-off: definition for presence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: he arranges markers, follows echoes, presses play. The tightening occurs when he hears his own decay on tape, transforming abstract yearning into visceral confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: his body’s creak, tomorrow’s inevitable amnesia, the bitter-sweet “flavor of aging.” Coincidence (finding the labeled tape) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to listen and endure crystallizes stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira chooses to photograph the collapse rather than prevent it. Escalation is driven by her agency: prying the clock hand, setting the timer by leaf-fall sound, sealing the camera. Cost is unmistakable: the station’s destruction, her younger self forever confined to a negative, and the irreversible forfeiture of constancy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each beat deepening thematic and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—tightens when Calderon confesses, “I never learned to end things clean,” forcing Mara to reframe closure itself. Her agency deepens the conflict: she shifts from hymning mundane sounds to transposing “scent of hope” into melody. Cost is felt in Calderon’s surrender and Mara’s silent endurance. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost shadows—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra discovers her own silhouette has fled. The tightening occurs when she realizes closing loops demands personal sacrifice, narrowing options to a single trade: her shadow for the world’s. Agency drives escalation: her backward winding triggers retrograde time, stars bending into spoons. Cost is unmistakable: “traded her wandering silhouette” so “no one else would lose theirs.”

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus mercy—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the lie “nurtured the village.” The tightening occurs at the harvest firelight: seeing the “same child, alive and glowing” forces her to confront that her forensic certainty caused harm. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow the path, accept the map, and reframe error. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders the comfort of rightness, embracing a world where “stronger at the bend” replaces rectitude.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sharing non-threatening light—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes villagers “barred doors at dusk.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the mist lifts the shard, forcing her to choose: hoard the pearl or release it. Cost is legible: the sea glass dulls, the pearl dissolves, and Lira walks home empty-handed yet full. Agency drives escalation—her polishing method summons the pearl; her tilt triggers the drop—no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming narrative from viral exposure—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses burial over broadcast. Her agency drives escalation: confession (scream) → recording (seed) → burial (cultivation), each narrowing options (no names exchanged, tablet destroyed). Cost is felt in vulnerability (“throat tightened”) and tactical forfeiture (surrendering digital reach for analog permanence). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: drip cadence tightens into ritual, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finishing the novel despite fear—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s active choices: speaking deleted lines, kneeling for the chord, offering the shell back. Each cameo deepens the cost (cowardice mirrored in Lira, time lost to avoidance). The tightening culminates in her decision to release hopes rather than collect them, which forecloses her old coping mechanism. Coincidence never resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring ancestral knowledge to cure children—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s personal loss. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her singing activates the tendril, times the harvest, and releases pollen. The tightening occurs at moonset, a live clock that narrows options to one precise moment. Cost is unmistakable: the vine dies, Elara bears generational grief, and success hinges on flawless execution under immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering a lost lover through heartbeat cartography—is signaled early and deepens when the plate reveals veins mirroring his own. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his patient exhalations, precise movements, and silent sealing force the world to respond (orchard exhales, scarecrow beats). Cost is unmistakable: he trades mobility for meaning, becoming part of the pattern rather than escaping it. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each beat narrows his existence to this sacred stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring time by understanding echo-harvesting—is signaled early and tightens when Ansel discovers sound-scalloped gears, proving the mechanism fed on village voices. His agency drives escalation: studying angles, measuring delays, reassembling in reverse. Cost is unmistakable: lost hours return thinner, and wonder is stored away, not used. The wounded season’s lull isn’t passive backdrop—it pressures every move, narrowing options until silence becomes the only tool left.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—collecting burdens to prevent valley collapse—tightens when the grotto resists, forcing the weaver to risk self-incrimination. Escalation is driven by her agency: tilting the flame, speaking the unspeakable. Cost is legible in blood, breath loss, and the lamp left behind. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—the weight of memories crescendos until her own burden cracks the system.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing Emil’s last moment—is signaled early and tightens when Mara carves the lion’s mercy/grief, narrowing her world to wood and memory. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to carve, to label jars, to hang the latch—not passive mourning but active harvesting of “lessons from loss.” Cost is unmistakable: blood in sawdust, the empty ring, promises scattered like shavings. Under the Accumulative lens, each shaving deepens pressure until the final Charged Poise crystallizes options—memory as both cage and key.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one’s younger self to reclaim agency over eroded dreams—is signaled early and deepens through two key turns: first confession (“map every island…”) yields a blurred slide; second (“last witness…”) materializes the ghost on a bench, raising emotional stakes. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to break the camera, releasing latent images that dissolve into the lagoon—a sacrifice that reweights possibility itself. Cost is unmistakable: ambitions “erode another micron” with each interaction, culminating in irreversible separation from the ghost. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from character choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting hope via redirected flow—is signaled early and deepens when Alya realizes the “maze of intentions” points inward, not skyward. Escalation is driven by her agency: each weld, reroute, and equation scratch narrows options and raises conceptual stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she works alone, repurposes junk, and accepts that wonder must replace crowds. The maintenance drone’s reboot isn’t coincidence—it’s triggered by her glycol reroute, proving pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens when Arlen removes the pendulum, foreclosing his life’s work. Escalation is protagonist-driven: he chooses to carry no drawings, then to disassemble the prototype, each act narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable: “weight transferred into the stones… hollow beneath his ribs.” The glacial hush deepens pressure until stance crystallizes—not through external force but internal reckoning under Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: investors’ rejection occurs off-page, slightly softening opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus inherited myth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the “medical crates” log entry contradicts artillery weight, forcing Mara to act. The escalation is driven by her agency: translating, cross-checking, demanding a detour. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of paternal heroism and the burden of public witness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Mara’s trained instincts confronting deliberate erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving storm-corn’s planting method—is signaled early and tightens when the last tide-weaver dies. Ari’s agency drives escalation: she decodes knots despite fragility, plants the seed mid-confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits secrecy (planting openly) and risks losing the rope. The harbormaster embodies institutional opposition, but pressure coheres through Ari’s choices, not external luck—fulgurite’s chime completes the stanza because she pressed it to her ribs, aligning pulse with pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the “geography of healing”—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the thread reveals itself as spun absence. The traveler’s agency drives escalation: her choice to unmake the weave forces confrontation with each client’s chosen ending, culminating in her own. Cost is unmistakable—the thread shortens as she releases others, and finally herself; her seven-year trade ends with an empty notebook. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and deepens when the egg warms, forcing higher-risk assembly. Protagonist agency drives escalation: hypothesizing leads to distillation, grave-robbing, music-box necropolis descent. Cost is unmistakable: the palace plummets, beauty flees, yet the fall becomes wings. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via cadence shift from trembling reverie to decisive soldering, then release.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens when Mara chooses to graft rather than bury her father’s legacy, foreclosing pure rejection. Agency drives escalation: her steady hands despite courtroom-flashback flinching, her breath subduing anger, her GPS logging of “Station Green 13” as covert resistance. Cost is unmistakable—the tremor beneath control, the memory-hiss of myths, the promise to return bearing more weight. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail (gull cry, ember-kissed skin, dolphin lighter) deepens the central conflict without coincidence or deflation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens with each breadcrumb, culminating in the irreversible opening of the box. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mara chooses to speak, to see, to release. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of her defensive walls and the permanent shift in the city’s silence. Coincidence never resolves; time’s suspension merely frames her internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting light without self-immolation—is signaled early and tightens when Kael discovers the hidden beacon, forcing a choice between inherited sorrow and active sharing. Agency drives escalation: his sonar pinging initiates the signal that leads to the cavity. Cost is unmistakable—the gear grows quiet, the beacon crumbles—and reweights the garden’s purpose. The 97-year fracture pattern deepens stakes but doesn’t resolve them; Kael’s break from it crystallizes pressure into action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when the carver realizes poems are “chisel strokes against the stone of sorrow.” Escalation occurs through her agency: following butterflies, touching headstones, sitting among them to absorb weight. The cost is unmistakable: she must abandon her craft’s traditional purpose. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the entire village’s method of mourning, though the tightening lacks a concrete tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between land, sea, and inherited debt—is signaled early and deepens when the inscriptions end on “—e,” forcing a decisive trade-off: stop the clock (void contracts, return land) or keep it running (sea eats more). Protagonist agency drives escalation: his carving and bob replacement directly alter tactics and village reality. Cost is visible in slowed time, corroded iron, and villagers’ silent shift from ledgers to seeds—a tangible reweighting of communal values.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering “the shape of intentions”—tightens when the coin pulses, forcing Mercy to choose between dawn pruning and nocturnal excavation. Agency drives escalation: her decoding of threads alters knowledge, which redirects her spade from family mound to lamb’s feet. Cost is visible: she locks herself underground, exchanging daylight rounds for eternal stewardship. The spiral’s closure demands sacrifice, not luck—coincidence (finding case) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—writing a future that grows from within constraint—is signaled early and deepens as the cartographer realizes she must become the constraint. Escalation is driven by her agency: each stroke costs memory, then identity, then physical form. The tightening (dawn approaching) forces irreversible trade-offs, culminating in her dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders selfhood so others may innovate beyond her imagination.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—smuggling stories past narrative ban—tightens when Mila learns the broadcast encodes meaning in intervals. Her agency drives escalation: decoding, rosin ink, copper antennae. Cost is felt: risk of capture, labor, solitude. Solstice timing creates a live clock; inspectors’ intrusion tests her stance. Coincidence never resolves—only her preparation does.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving form to unspoken grief—is signaled early and tightens when Elena positions the chair, forcing a trade-off between preservation and exposure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to scatter powder, transforming passive inheritance into active ritual. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—each grain marks a withheld truth, making absence tangible. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus denial—is signaled early and tightens when Caldera chooses bone over ink, foreclosing assimilation. Her agency drives escalation: each dive deepens knowledge (ledgers contradict), culminating in the sump’s “silent agreement” that forces her counter-narrative. Cost is unmistakable: surfacing to recoiling traders, she sacrifices belonging for legacy. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—sedimentary layers = competing narratives = moral ballast.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—unlearning hatred through sonic subtraction—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara collects syllables, then sacrifices her voice. The tightening is visceral: without a root tone, harmony fractures, forcing her ultimate trade-off. Cost is unmistakable—her permanent silence—and reweights the city’s auditory landscape. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from her methodical listening under the “unbinding” clock.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rewiring collective memory through forbidden cuisine—is signaled early and escalates via Marisol’s agency: stealing, planting, pruning, harvesting. The tightening occurs at celestial alignment, narrowing options to one breath-window. Cost is visible in ash-and-dust compost, blood offering, and Ministry threat. Coincidence complicates (loudspeakers), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle demands a lie, forcing Mara to betray her truth-bound nature. Escalation is driven by her agency: accepting the box, climbing, speaking falsehood. Cost is unmistakable: loss of identity (“I keep nothing but the gate”) and irreversible change (coins etched with bees, open gate at dawn). Coincidence complicates (blackout) but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring homes’ “alive-ness” by acknowledging displaced objects—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elara collects fragments, deciphers streetlight Morse, and crushes the orris shard to deepen shadows. The tightening occurs when she realizes “displaced objects leave cavities which… widen into living absences,” forcing her to shift from observation to ritual action. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices the shard (her grounding object) and accepts permanent absence (needle-less compass), altering the bay’s reality at personal emotional expense. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—welcoming nuance into a certainty-frozen world—is signaled early and tightens at the arch: breaking the ampoule risks dissolving identity (“marble robes shedding flakes”) but preserves extinction if unbroken. Protagonist agency drives escalation (gliding, listening, choosing gentleness over force), with cost visible in softened stone skin and lost certainties. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice: truth requires admitting complicity in the gardener’s betrayal. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each awakening deepens the necessity of release.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering the tactile essence of a missed connection—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the staircase slows, forcing Elara’s panicked blood-offering. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her prime-counting, backward climb, and final refusal all narrow options under Accumulative/Textural pressure. Cost is unmistakable: her existence as climber is forfeited to preserve the memory’s texture, crystallized in the staircase’s convulsive forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased kindness through lost language—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mira chooses to paint despite exhaustion, positions the mirror, accepts Jules’ presence. Pressure tightens when wind rattles panes and bristles glow, forcing faster painting that transforms mural from wall-art to breathable air. Cost is unmistakable: four sleepless nights, vanished grandmothers, fined dialects—all paid so strangers might exhale grateful syllables. Coincidence (Jules arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; he merely witnesses and inhales.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving dying arts—tightens when the beekeeper fails to return, forcing displaced families to become culture-bearers themselves. Aurelia’s agency drives escalation: she shifts from passive waiting to documenting portable archives, then baking. The thaw forecloses external rescue, raising the cost of inaction. Final stakes crystallize in the Chen grandmother’s rebuke, making clear that survival requires active transmission, not archival distance—a trade-off Aurelia accepts by shaping “H” for home.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—stepping beyond fate’s design—is signaled early and tightens when mural clocks smear numerals, forcing the yoyo-as-escapement insight. Protagonist agency drives escalation: winding, failing tricks, tying the stone, leaping into the fold. Cost is unmistakable—the hunger stone burns out, his gift vanishes—and reweights the final image (simple clock promising change). Luck complicates (prophecy visions) but never resolves; the tear in time stems solely from opposed torques he engineers.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting the memory of parental death—is signaled early and deepens when the dictionary cross-references “resuscitation” with “mirror,” forcing the protagonist to act. Agency drives escalation: pinning the clasp through the photo initiates the corridor, a choice that narrows options to direct confrontation. Cost is felt in the loss of the advisor’s voice and the relinquished talisman. Under an Accumulative lens, the single deepening (dictionary insight → skewering image) suffices, though a second tightening might have pushed this into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—surviving the Doldrum Wall by tuning stillness—is signaled early and tightens decisively when engines fail. Protagonist agency drives escalation: first dubbing recorded sounds, then orchestrating heartbeats, finally striking absence. Cost is unmistakable: laughter falls flat, oars fail, and forward motion requires fractal resonance—a trade-off where communal rhythm replaces individual will. Coincidence (cloud spiral) complicates but doesn’t resolve; solution emerges from prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preventing the city from tumbling into the Crack—is signaled early and tightens when Grand Akmon shudders, matching the lost expedition’s cadence. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she alters the pattern, provoking the watchers’ response. Cost is unmistakable: the revelation that her mother chose exile, and now she must guide others toward voluntary departure. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—exposing foundational lies—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elara chooses silence over confrontation, uses terrain to evade capture, and accepts social exile as price. The tightening moment (finding the letter) forces a trade-off between aesthetic seduction and historical duty. Coincidence (watchman’s timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her escape is earned by prior knowledge (smugglers’ cipher) and physical risk. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits familial legacy for verifiable fact.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory of abandoned dreams—is signaled early and intensifies through Mara’s clandestine method, which forecloses engineering salvation in favor of poetic archaeology. Each note insertion narrows options: she chooses emotional truth over structural report, deepening the conflict between civic duty and personal grief. Cost is unmistakable in the inkwell’s “lighter” weight and her solitary departure—agency expressed through renunciation, not action. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering honest origins—tightens when the blackout disables the grid, enabling the stamp’s use, and deepens when Mara realizes the catalogue indexes *her*. Agency drives escalation: she extinguishes her lantern to harness darkness, presses the stamp on water, and initiates rewriting. Cost is felt in the irreversible burden of counter-memory (“private pressure”) and the physical toll of rising water. The blackout’s duration functions as a live clock, narrowing options until the phosphorescent breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into release—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone cracks, forcing her to inhale the dream directly. Her agency drives escalation: choosing the southern stair, pocketing the leaf, breathing in the galaxy. Cost is unmistakable: each crane costs a “day she arrived too late,” and the final act erases all traces of her passage, leaving the basilica “ready for the next grief.”

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes he’s “death’s accountant.” Escalation is driven by his agency: smashing circuit breakers, tracking energy signatures, accelerating the hunt. Each act exacts visible cost (geode fragments, moral weight), narrowing options until only self-sacrifice remains. The final perturbation—his fall altering drone trajectory—is earned through prior logic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the “frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes her grandmother’s star charts on the chip, linking past and present. The meaningful deepening occurs when the pilgrim reveals her parents “found their frequency,” transforming abstract longing into actionable hope. Agency peaks in Mara’s decision to pull the lever, a physical act that forecloses passive searching. Cost is felt: she embraces a path defined by faith, not proof, under twilight’s narrowing light.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus fabricated solace—is signaled early and deepens when Elias learns his client was his mother. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to forge the lie, vomits in consequence, then seeks the carving. The tightening occurs when he finds his own honest face in wood, foreclosing further fabrication. Cost is felt in the “second heart” of truth and his mother’s terminal fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—untethering Seris without granting either crown victory—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s moon-synchronized strategy. His agency drives escalation: halting the herald, inviting knot-tying, humming the lullaby. Each choice narrows options (no document, no chains) and exacts cost (carrying recycled mistakes as bone-weight). The waxing crescent’s “furrowed hush” isn’t backdrop—it’s tactical timing that makes mercy possible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—aligning heart and action—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses shoals over charted safety, trading certainty for authenticity. Escalation is driven by her agency: each pole approached tightens pressure, culminating in tearing charts as a physical renunciation. Cost is unmistakable—the lover left behind, the compass’s irreparable crack—and the “backlash of regrets” transforms into forward motion through her decisions, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—remembering whom he hurt to kindle empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the lake offers absorption vs. hollowness. The seeker’s agency drives escalation: he reads coordinates, chooses diagonals, steps in. Cost is unmistakable: bones illuminated like “paper lanterns,” heart skipping then restarting with others’ rhythms. The turnstile metaphor crystallizes the moral calculus—redemption requires shared passage, not solo salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming sisterhood beyond fire—is signaled early and deepens through the conjuration ritual. The tightening occurs when the narrator realizes “one of us had to die into the other’s form,” forcing a trade-off with irreversible cost. Agency drives escalation: each ingredient ground, each name whispered, narrows options until only fusion remains. Coincidence never resolves; fire surrenders only after love proves stronger than myth.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time with her stillborn daughter—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: she actively reads cards, traces names in clouds, and unfastens grief. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: pressure builds via sensory density (porcelain voices naming traumatic timestamps) until the saucer crack detaches as “lightning bolt of memory,” forcing a decisive inhale of reclaimed time. Cost is unmistakable—years of unlived moments flood her lungs, causing simultaneous laughter and weeping—and permanently alters her relationship to loss. No coincidence resolves conflict; every turn stems from her ritual choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension via joy heavy enough to counterbalance extinction—is signaled early and deepens when holograms warn “it may be mirror.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the sail’s completion: joy must now carry all grief, not evade it. Protagonist agency drives escalation—she chooses to fuse sorrow with joy, enabling passage. Cost is unmistakable: she trades mobility for eternal tending, vacuum tugging at her heels as she stays.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether purpose can be reclaimed through selfless action—is signaled early and deepens when Lira appears. The “detour” isn’t evasion but rediscovery of a buried path, narrowing options to ascent or surrender. Agency drives escalation: Kael chooses to follow, enter, submerge. Cost is unmistakable—his former life dissolves into glass, yet he gains a new currency of touch. Coincidence complicates (bugs orchestrate shelter) but never resolves; resolution stems from Kael’s willingness to wade into transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sparking silent revolution—is signaled early and tightens when Garnet chooses graphite over compliance. Agency is clear: she coaxes locks, bridges terminals, deceives Voss. Cost is unmistakable: the cradle of sparks dies temporarily, yet its “secret heartbeat” passes onward, risking everything for drifting sky-barges. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, with each beat narrowing options toward irreversible liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling Mira’s promise before the tide—tightens as Elias works against time and his own curse. His agency lies in attention and placement, not control; each rock narrows possibility until the ninth triggers resonance. The cost is felt: understanding is revealed as futile, and Mira’s death is reweighted as purposeful. Coincidence never resolves; the climax arises from his disciplined ritual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from hiding words to broadcasting them into static. Agency drives escalation: her choice to feed strips into chemicals transforms passive vigil into active transmission. Cost is unmistakable: she vanishes, leaving only a star-stain and reset timer. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether inquiry serves peace or provocation—is signaled early and deepens through the duel-as-syntax. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he initiates the fencing exchange, reads the slip of paper, and interprets the brook’s role. The meaningful tightening occurs when Vale reveals “The brook reverses at dusk,” foreclosing the path of solo interpretation and forcing collaborative reading. Cost is unmistakable: both men relinquish the identity of sole truth-bearer, a sacrifice made visible in lowered foils and synchronized steps.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when bulldozer threat resurfaces. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Lark chooses vulnerability (showing the tin), then collaboration (rebuilding). Cost is visible in shed skins and torn intake forms; the trade-off (solitude for partnership) forecloses his old survival mode. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in Rourke’s retreat—a tactical win bought with performative compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether waiting constitutes action—is signaled early and deepens when the film offers escape-as-rehearsal. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to ascend, trade the chime, play the chord, then exit. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning the loop’s safety for uncertain reality. The “flickering compasses” crystallize stakes by pointing toward her fears, making the final poise feel hard-won under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory against monsoon-driven erasure—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Calyx confronts the “monochrome canyon” of collective forgetting. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the dream, interpret symbols, and ultimately plant the seed at personal cost. The moral calculus—losing her teacher’s name to save the Aya’s memory—is sharp, unavoidable, and paid on the page. Coincidence (thunder as timer) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—diffusing “cerulean regret”—tightens through Kaede’s instructions, each escalating the emotional labor required. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn: tracing vine, untying knot, exhaling breath. Cost is unmistakable: speech is foreclosed (“he raised a slow finger to his lips”), and the ghost ship’s compass is retired, its duty done. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—density increases until sorrow is transmuted into the bonsai’s impossible teal.
