  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding disaster through patient observation versus dramatic narrative—deepens through accumulating scientific measurements that reveal "gradual change...sounds gentle until it crosses a threshold." Pressure coheres around Mara's systematic denial of anthropomorphism and drama, with the caterpillar encounter testing her commitment to objectivity. The conflict lacks a decisive tightening that would foreclose options; instead it maintains steady textural pressure without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose beyond revenge—tightens when she finds evidence of other murdered glass artists and must choose between pursuit and release. The scorched ledger's physical disintegration creates urgency. However, the final transformation to opening a studio lacks the visceral pressure of the canyon sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: single fork strike → multiple strikes → full thermal orchestra → melting dome → city-wide transformation. The cost is legible (Mara's capsizing trauma transforms into artistic purpose). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the stakes could intensify more sharply at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal summons through discovering the drowned library to accepting eternal guardianship, with the undertaker's agency driving key turns (pressing shard into bezel, burning paper boats of names). The cost is legible—he trades his mortal life to become the lighthouse keeper—though middle pressure could tighten further between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake of community survival under sanctions intensifies through escalating scarcity (flour vanishing entirely) and adaptation (saffron ground to ink). The meaningful deepening occurs when Mara transforms preservation method from food distribution to cultural encoding. Cost is legible in Lila's death and the four-year duration, though agency could be stronger in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of finding/releasing unused love progresses through breath-matching, jade-sharing, and orchard passage, with visible cost in giving away Kwan Yin's tear. Escalation reads more as deepening recognition than causal tightening, appropriate for the accumulative lens. The "fracture in her chest" knitting provides felt consequence, though middle-section pressure could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern intensification: photographs fading → garden responding → fragment burning → physical dissolution. The stakes deepen from personal memory loss to existential transformation, with Elara's agency in crushing the fragment creating the decisive turn. Cost is visible in her dissolution ("veins becoming roots, her breath becoming spore").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal liberation to preserving humanity's future food supply, with the protagonist actively choosing to risk capture by delaying guards rather than flee. The tension between immediate escape and long-term mission creates genuine pressure, though the guards' easy entanglement in netting slightly undercuts the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding betrayal to heal absence—deepens when Mara discovers her own complicity in the fracture. The forge scene provides meaningful escalation as she must "feed the forge what you miss most," with visible cost in the burned absence. Pressure coheres but relies heavily on conceptual rather than physical tension.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from simple theft to moral choice about memory manipulation, with the wedding ring's inscription forcing the key reversal. Cost is visible in the woman's tears and the thief's altered mission, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—creating "safe zones for inquiry" to process grief—deepens through Mara's dramatic narration and physical crafting, culminating in her choice to leave the dome behind. The tension between fleeing and staying provides meaningful escalation. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from identity crisis (DNA revelation) through inheritance quest (finding the shell) to career transformation (choosing to leak vulnerable footage). The guards' arrival forces Leo's decisive projection gambit, and his choice to walk "toward the studio backlot" with trembling certainty shows agency foreclosing his old masked identity with clear professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating silences that literally consume physical space ("stones pulling inward"), forcing the oracle's choice between completing her map or preserving reality. Cost is visible in the erasure of names and world. The single meaningful deepening satisfies this length though more intermediate resistance would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to obsession across the loops, with clear deepening from touching the violin (loop 193) to playing it (loop 373). The tension between programmed purpose and emergent consciousness creates authentic pressure. The acceptance of eternal repetition as the medium for thought represents meaningful cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from accounting discrepancy to trust restoration through Mira's discovery of the staged hunt. The choice to "let both go" (lens and truth) forecloses accusation with clear relational cost. One meaningful tightening when she discovers the orchestration suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The 0.03% luck score creates immediate tension against the garden's generous response, with escalation through the maze's shifting walls, the impossible apple's appearance, and the ancient glove discovery. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment - the garden's gifts arrive without Elara facing a true forfeit or trade-off that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The escalation builds through accumulation: nexus throbbing faster → lever engagement → holographic projections → time tilting sideways → stepping outside timeline → returning transformed. The cost manifests in her conscious choice to delay emergence ("when the moment was ripe"), though the middle section's reflection could have maintained more present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding and accepting artistic invisibility—develops through the musician's exploration and the ghost's guidance. Escalation occurs as he moves deeper into the flooded building, but agency feels limited as he mostly follows the ghost's predetermined path. The final choice to play disruptive music shows agency, though the journey there feels more observational than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: seed becomes weight becomes rootlet becomes stone, each stage forcing embodied response. The oracle's agency drives the smudging ritual and stone expulsion with visible cost. The "heavier" repetition and aurora's arrival create temporal pressure that forces action.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to spiritual reckoning as Jules moves deeper into the tunnel, with the valve wheel compelling each transgression. The ghostly workers' appearance with beads on tongues creates a test of faith that Jules cannot refuse, leading to physical transformation (burns) and metaphysical burden (1,887 lbs). One meaningful deepening as the abstract "swallowed truth" becomes literal weight transferred to Jules's body.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on maintaining witness versus surrendering to dissolution, with one meaningful deepening as she realizes her loose grip is "mercy" not decay. The origami swan's wearing paper creates escalating pressure toward the inevitable end. Cost is clear but the middle section meanders through description without tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the whistle "trembling, almost failing" before Elara steadies it with the curl's memory. The dominant stake of restoring wonder tightens effectively, though the opposition remains primarily internal rather than dramatized through external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from collecting stories to understanding the "displaced axis" to becoming it herself. Each diary reveals deeper layers (breathing dragons→loose stone→fire as door), though the pressure remains contemplative rather than urgent. The final cost—surrendering individual identity—lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes deepen through Chen's realization that staying would make him "one more note in its familiar enigma," forcing his departure choice. The fortune's accidental prophecy creates pressure as "it was accidentally prophetic, the kind that turned true because people carried it in their pockets." Cost manifests as Chen feels "the rocky island slide inside him," permanently altered by his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating sound layers that deepen the dominant stake of faith versus doubt. The reversal when he plays everything in "infinite reverse" meaningfully tightens options. The woman's intervention and the possession's departure create sufficient cost, though the abstract nature of the possession slightly dulls immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clear dominant stake (completing the symphony before exhaustion) with escalating physical cost and narrowing time. The thirty-minute constraint drives pacing effectively. However, the conflict remains largely internal without meaningful opposition beyond fatigue, and the transformation from mapping to conducting doesn't fully dramatize the stakes' resolution—we see the result but not the struggle of that pivotal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on conquering "the labyrinth of self" with escalation through fractures, ghost-Kaels, and confronting the elder version. The tablet-smashing provides decisive agency with clear cost. However, the abstract nature of the self-labyrinth concept prevents stakes from feeling fully visceral, and the boy-in-room resolution doesn't fully pay off the established conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from seeking sound, to repairing the needle, to feeling backward music, to making the drum, each layer intensifying emotional stakes. The cost—welcoming grief's full weight—is felt through embodied description. Lacks a sharp reversal but the accumulative pressure effectively narrows Mara's emotional options toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal integrity to systemic truth as Elara discovers the quarantine zone contains uncensored weather data. Her choice to stay underground and release contradictory data shows clear agency with visible cost. The pressure tightens effectively from being followed to discovering manipulation to choosing underground exile, though the follower's specific identity remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to release suppressed grief—escalates through sensory accumulation as each inhalation risks unleashing "the sob he'd kept corked since Lira died." The orchid's sympathetic resonance and release of the hospital bracelet scent represents a meaningful deepening that forces Elian's final choice to embrace rather than contain grief, with cost visible in abandoning his profession.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—choosing between transcendence and remaining flesh—intensifies through Marcus's escape traces, Mrs. Chen's departure, and the energy beings' persistent presence. The narrator's decision to carry Marcus's rope while walking between states forecloses the simple binary with visible cost. Escalation reads through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on transforming the "chronic hush" through incomplete music, with one meaningful deepening when Mara realizes "beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation." The cost appears in her leaving the bowl behind and walking away. Escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake - Lira's need for authentic feeling versus her professional detachment - deepens through the scent experience that forces her to feel what her clients felt. The cost is unmistakable: her armor becomes "a discarded coat" and she accepts the hurt of every half-truth she sold.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of maintaining compassion while hiding it creates consistent pressure, with meaningful deepening when Marisol must decide whether to share her precious locket. The cost is visible in giving away her mother's photo. However, escalation relies heavily on coincidence (Beto's connection, finding the NGO) rather than protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from individual belonging to collective meaning-making as the search group grows from two to thirty-seven people. The revelation that the artist "had never been a single person" reweights all prior searching. Cost is felt through "luminescent ache" and the permanent scar, though the resolution feels slightly too harmonious.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes clearly established (finding where echoes are born to recover mother's last syllable) with meaningful escalation through time-borrowing mechanics that demand repayment. The cost accumulates as borrowed seconds must be repaid with future minutes, forcing the ultimate trade-off. Minor deduction for the giant Bran element feeling somewhat ornamental to the core pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of understanding grief through mathematical logic deepens when the protagonist realizes "emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections," forcing acceptance of ambiguity. The escalation from silence to single drop to renewed music shows clear progression. Cost is visible in accepting the master will never return while carrying forward his teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Elias's private collecting to active sharing when he recognizes the girl "needed the voices." The tightening occurs when he chooses visibility over safety, with clear cost in abandoning three years of hiding. Agency drives the climax through his decision to reveal the fragments and himself.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through Mira's loss of control as "silver veins now spreading across her arms" forces her transformation choice. The cost is visceral—"legs rooted into the greenhouse floor"—though the extended denouement after the transformation completes somewhat deflates the peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of finding meaning after collapse escalates through the exchange from material goods to recognition to artistic creation, with each stage deepening understanding. The painting becomes the vehicle for transformation, and the spring water exchange carries genuine cost as "water that had never been touched by the wars." Slight weakness in the convenience of finding exactly the right person with the right wisdom at the right moment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—gaining sight at another's cost—escalates from rumor to irreversible exchange. The seer's staggering backward with "vision fracturing into kaleidoscopic warnings" shows genuine consequence. However, the pilgrim's attempt to "return the gift" feels gestural rather than a genuine reversal opportunity, and the years-later coda disperses some of the central tension's force.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through the trumpet's assembly stages, each requiring negotiation and revealing cost. The pressure accumulates from personal exile to collective healing need. The final choice to blow the note carries visible weight through "staggered intervals of fear and forgiveness."

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of confronting unspoken truths escalates through increasingly personal confessions—from "white, small" lies to core artistic fears. Each punched confession lights a compartment, building pressure toward the final choice. The cost is legible: Alden must abandon his safe mapping practice for vulnerable artistic expression.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving grief can be solved by reason versus accepting connection—develops through Mara's interaction with the tile, building to her choice to "listen instead of refute." The escalation through accumulating memories and sensory intrusions effectively forces her stance change, though the conflict could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal boredom to the technicians' mutiny to Vey's existential choice. The amulet's compulsion creates genuine pressure. The final cost is clear but somewhat abstract ("formerly infinite heart"), limiting full emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear dominant stake (posthumously redeeming mother's name) with meaningful escalation when Cassidy activates the ink and Rurik's rigid convictions liquefy. The cost—losing her mother's lullaby forever—is felt and irreversible. Minor deduction as Rurik's resistance could have been more substantial before capitulating.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes accumulate through textural deepening as Aurelia realizes the labyrinth is "reading her inventories, refracting her inventions back into seed and sap," forcing her choice between stopping or continuing despite fearing she'll "exhaust the world's longing." The cost is legible when trees grow full-sized and she gains "one truth" while losing innocence about her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of reconstructing identity after bureaucratic erasure is clear from opening. Pressure accumulates through fragment collection with one meaningful deepening when protagonist realizes "the labyrinth is not a maze but a press." The tidal clock creates urgency. Cost is legible in the desperate act of taping borrowed memories to chest as "armor of overheard existence."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—solving why civilizations bury three sounds with their dead—deepens through Arlen's cello playing as each note resurrects voices and forces him to confront his past certainty. The cost accumulates visibly as the seashell cracks and Arlen abandons his debunker identity. The escalation through three notes to final understanding works, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation works through accumulation - from negotiators measuring decks to graffiti resistance to overnight reorganization, each layer deepening stakes. The "foundation questioned" debate whether to scuttle creates genuine cost consideration. Limited by the Syndicate's somewhat passive antagonism and their easy retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through the tightening temporal window—from 43 minutes to the first blush to the final shutter clicks as anemones fold "with soft crystalline clicks." The dominant stake (preserving the last record) faces coherent pressure through the expiring contract, the anemones' brief window, and the abandoned human infrastructure. Cost manifests in the permanent fossil imprints and the inspector's recognition that "witnessing could be a form of resistance against forgetting."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Time pressure from the Aurora's departure creates genuine urgency that tightens through "seven minutes" to launch. The drone's trauma creating a feedback loop adds unexpected complication. Slightly formulaic in how smoothly the resolution proceeds once the method is found.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding where rivers begin vs. Registry control) escalates through Maren's descent and culminates in her choice to release knowledge through dissolution rather than official channels. Cost is visible in the Registry's dismissal and the solitary nature of her discovery. Some middle development feels convenient (the warm air, the glowing water's exact properties).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through the ritual's seven circuits building toward transformation, with the north ward's resistance creating genuine obstacle. Elian's sacrifice of his heartbeat rhythm to complete the restoration shows clear agency and cost. The piece earns its resolution through accumulated pressure rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from simple survival to preserving memory and connection, with the temple's resistance creating mounting pressure. The dominant stake—getting a signal out before air runs out—tightens when Mira must sacrifice her most precious object. The cost is legible when she places the empty vial as "an offering too small to see yet too large to measure."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: each descended step erases behind him, walls demand story-payment, the pipe releases memory that forces reckoning. The stake—escaping inherited silence/lies—tightens when Silas must forgive to transform the space. Cost is visible in the irrevocable leaving of the known world, though the final meadow arrival slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from the ghost's search to the boy's discovered tumor to the masters' harvest attempt, with clear tightening when scalpels appear at the grafting altar. The ghost's intervention and the boy's choice to step onto black ice show agency foreclosing the path of passive victimhood with visible cost. Minor deduction as the tumor threat could have been more viscerally felt in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on restoration versus ruin, with Calyx's blood sacrifice marking the key escalation point. The cost is visible when "the loom sank gently beneath the returning tide." However, the conflict lacks sharp opposition—the canyon guides rather than resists, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal return to communal restoration, with the tightening occurring when roots begin moving and pointing toward the prayer house site. The protagonist's agency drives the reconstruction through deliberate sundial placement and hymn-teaching. Cost registers in the permanent foreclosure of travel—"never left the island again."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reveal vs. conceal identity) escalates through the mail drone's early arrival creating time pressure and forcing her choice between two letters. The cost is visible as she keeps the confession, choosing continued anonymity. Pressure could be stronger—the middle reflection passages dilute momentum rather than tightening the screws.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from stitching maps to encoding supply routes to the confrontation where "the fool was the only one who had truly listened." The pressure peaks when the lieutenant draws his pistol, with cost visible in the transformed plotters who "left the chamber changed."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (reconciliation with brother) remains clear throughout, with meaningful deepening when the protagonist sees the brother's matching desire for wholeness. The transformation of letters to moths and the healing water provide visible cost. However, the mystical resolution somewhat deflates earned tension—the magic corridor makes the apology easier than the guilt buildup suggests it should be.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake of translation-as-healing deepens through the revelation that the cast notes are "confession, a ledger of collective guilt," forcing the narrator to confront personal failure (mistranslated massacre). The morphine-altered state creates time pressure ("before the dark eats the words"). Cost is visible but escalation remains somewhat gentle for the stakes established.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from searching for a misplaced color to risking "present sorrow" to develop the memory-film, with clear cost at each stage. The Lantern Lattice complicates by requiring a specific living wall, narrowing options. The trade-off is explicit: exchanging current pain for recovered joy, though the middle section could tighten pressure between discovery and painting.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from restoring a single mosaic to understanding she IS the city's restoration process. The nickel's bargain creates clear cost - trading certainty for curiosity. Pressure coheres through the accumulative folding that forces Liora to confront her multiplicities. Minor deduction because the middle folding sequence, while conceptually rich, slightly diffuses immediate pressure before reconverging.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving defiance against thought taxation) established early and tested through Voss's arrival, forcing Arlo to choose between capture and mission completion. The escape using pollen distraction meaningfully tightens options. Cost is more projected (future blooming) than immediately felt, keeping this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Zale moves from listening to the lullaby, touching the dew-droplets of memory, reading the postcard's hidden message, to finally planting it. The cost is legible when he leaves "centuries of longing stayed behind" to photosynthesize. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from saving names to sacrificing memories to ultimately sacrificing self, with each trade-off forcing harder choices. The chandelier's demand for payment creates persistent pressure that narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in Lira's hollowing into translucence and final erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear escalation through three promises building toward the symphony's completion, with each promise carrying increased risk. The final choice to "become the last note" shows agency with visible cost. Stakes tighten from personal restoration to accepting permanent transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from technical problem to potential sabotage to collaborative solution, with Corin's detonator cord creating genuine tension. The 70/30 compromise represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses pure safety or pure renewal. Cost is visible as both sides must accept partial defeat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: from solitary practice to partnership with Blackwood to creating the messenger network, each phase narrowing Mirela's options toward ultimate disappearance. The constables' arrival forces the final renunciation with clear cost. One meaningful tightening sufficient for this length, though the stakes could intensify more sharply at the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (discovering father's encoded message about thresholds) deepens through accumulation: from reading logbook to decoding table notches to stepping off the terrace edge. The butterfly effect provides persistent constraint shaping all subsequent mazes, though the final "necessary distance" resolution, while thematically resonant, could use more concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through ritual accumulation: finding feather → meeting ghost → drawing constellations → lighting copepods → inheriting feathers → tearing atlas page. The sunrise deadline creates genuine pressure, though the ghost's passivity reduces oppositional force—the conflict is primarily internal, against time and incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—deepens through the protagonist's discovery that she traded personal memory for preservation power. The migrating bird's seeds create escalating emotional resonance (regret→joy→longing→acceptance) under the accumulative lens. However, the conflict lacks present-scene opposition; most tension derives from retrospective realization rather than active pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming monotony into wonder) escalates through the orchestrated sequence: bishop placement → boy's discovery → crowd's reaction → applause for "impossible neatness of luck." The tension builds through precise timing constraints and the risk of exposure. Cost is visible in Cass's retreat into anonymity and her donation of the duplicate bishop to chance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate as Lysira races against dawn while the moonstone dust dims, forcing the final sacrifice. The cost is visible in the dust burning to complete the verse. However, the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond time pressure, and the transformation process could show more struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulation: from private communion to reading the bay's message to speaking aloud to hurling the prism. Each ring reveals deeper personal history (mother's teacup, stranger's harmonica, own scar) that Mara must acknowledge. The final act costs her the prism but gains communal healing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming guilt into communicable wisdom—escalates through the ritual sequence with visible cost (swallowing ash, crying, marking himself). The bargain's terms create persistent constraint, though the peak moment relies more on symbolic accumulation than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from adjusting the gauge, to creating patterns, to the balloon's arrival, to the equation's release. The dominant stake (revitalizing consensus reality) tightens when Mira must offer her blood and speak the equation. Cost is legible but the middle section lacks a clear tightening moment where options narrow—the balloon arrives without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries: hearing the echo → finding diaries → seeing herself in negatives → discovering her lineage → entering the tunnel → becoming the corridor. Each revelation tightens the trap of "legacy's burden" until transformation becomes inevitable. The cost is visceral: Mira loses human form to become what she sought to map.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from painting mirages to transforming reality through the borrowed heartbeat's power. The mirrors' resistance showing "endless reflections...failing these same failures" creates genuine obstacle before the breakthrough. Cost is visible in the dying child's sacrifice, though the final incomplete sentence slightly weakens the resolution's force.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of ending the forever war builds through the ritual accumulation of names and shared responsibility, creating modest escalation through collective participation. However, the negotiator's agency remains primarily observational—she signs but doesn't drive the transformation, and the actual treaty terms and their costs remain abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from reading the map to finding the egg to winding the music box to witnessing the ghost flock. The dominant stake—preserving extinction's echo—intensifies as each ritual step reveals deeper cost. Final image crystallizes the price: permanent drought holding their echo "in its cracked embrace."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Central stake (breaking conformity's hold) established early and deepens through echo-harvest to prism-core revelation. The cost materializes in "prints of blood and dew" and choosing to remain. Missing sharper mid-story tightening - the weaving process feels procedural rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict escalates from external (gallery quarrel) through magical intervention (reversed narrative) to internal resolution, with Lucien choosing to "letter questions rather than answers." While this represents a meaningful stance crystallization with cost (lost patronage), the magical device somewhat deflates earned pressure—the puppets show him insights rather than him discovering them through active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: single butterfly arrival → recognition of twin → swarm gathering → memorial lifting piece by piece. The cost is legible in Elara's tears and the physical dissolution of her work. Agency manifests through her deliberate construction and release rather than forced reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of preserving forgotten names before glacial erasure is signaled early and tested through the rope-braiding action. The transformation from fragile paper to "moving air" shows meaningful deepening, though the conflict lacks a strong opposing force beyond time/nature.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: seal warming → dream dissolution → seal melting into skin → bunker transformation → protagonist dissolving into storm. The cost is unmistakable as she loses physical form ("Lightning unthreads her name"). Stakes tighten from discovering "why paths choose walkers" to becoming the path itself with clear foreclosure of human existence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving astronomical knowledge before foreign conquest—escalates through Naram-bel's schematic discovery, the sanctum opening, and his final covenant choice. Each revelation narrows options: from observation to action to eternal guardianship. The cost manifests as his physical disappearance and perpetual duty, though the middle development could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: soldier's memory → girl's strawberries → shadow-Lira demanding reciprocal release → Lira accepting her own resentments. The cost is legible when she feels "bricks of fear restacking" and must metabolize the bombs she hated others for dropping. The final shared stillness shows clear foreclosure of the manipulative path.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through deepening understanding rather than external reversals - from hunting to constructing to the moment of hesitation that forces the choice. The cost is legible (giving up his quest, accepting mirrors that release rather than capture). Slightly weakened by the dream's agency feeling abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation through accumulation works—from broken contract to reading scroll-vows to grafting to barring elders. The ribbon's transformation and seven-day vigil show genuine cost. Slightly mechanical progression in middle section with convenient fig-scrolls reduces organicity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: touching trees → entering bathroom → descending to chamber → confronting Quell's warning → choosing not to carve. The cost manifests in Lira becoming part of the orchard's cycle ("trees began to blossom new buds bearing Lira's own face"). The dominant stake of knowledge vs. freedom tightens effectively though some middle beats feel more exploratory than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—retrieving unlearned lessons to prevent war—escalates through the time traveler's crystalline suspension and the linguistic cipher blocking the library. Elara's sacrifice of a life-year creates genuine cost. The tension between helping the traveler versus accessing the library forces a meaningful trade-off, though the resolution feels slightly neat with both goals achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding the garden/twin memory) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. Meaningful tightening occurs when Cassia realizes the garden is "not a place but a moment" requiring memory's release. Cost manifests in childhood dropping away, reflection fracturing, and final trust in dissolving stones. Agency demonstrated through climbing carousel and accepting overlap with chimera.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: seal melts → threads hover → memories reveal → final authorization required. Each discovery narrows Elara's options toward the inevitable choice to complete the cycle. The cost lands in the door's disappearance and time's fundamental alteration, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival to preserving collective memory, with the bloom of hush providing a ticking clock. The energy beings' presence creates constant pressure that shapes every movement. The final confrontation where silence becomes active weapon represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: missing shard revelation → retrocognitive cost of seeing the child → desert journey's isolation → finding the skeleton → the hush that makes "the desert fell mute." The final transformation where she "became the new prism" represents meaningful deepening with visible cost of eternal vigil. Stakes remain coherent around rekindling hope despite darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before storm erasure—is signaled early but never truly threatened. The "deepening hush" creates atmosphere but minimal escalation; her methodical work proceeds without meaningful opposition or tightening pressure. The tribute system (leaving fabric) introduces mild cost but lacks the narrowing of options or forced trade-offs that would elevate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through environmental response (roses igniting, sphere forming) driven by Luma's actions with the kerosene rag. The "gravity of hopelessness" snapping provides clear cost. However, the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond abstract hopelessness, and the resolution comes somewhat easily through magical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from solitary observation to daughter's arrival to shared witnessing. The jade cicada exchange creates meaningful tightening. Cost is present in "awkward jokes, the slow reweaving" but could be more visceral in the moment of choice itself.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through increasingly difficult silences culminating in the choice to release rather than possess. The hour's time limit creates genuine pressure, though the pruner's trade feels mechanically inserted rather than arising from Lira's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort through witnessed confession—escalates through the commuter's rising decibels (30, then back to 21) and the storm glass phases. The "fluidly logical" progression from hexagon formation to crystal dissolution to confession creates meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in both the spoken fear sealed in crystal and Nilo's perpetual vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (finding the stairway before sunrise) remains coherent but lacks meaningful tightening—the protagonist encounters no real obstacles or forced trade-offs. The discovery proceeds too smoothly; each reveal arrives without cost or reversal, missing the pressure that would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on the boy learning to "die properly" to find peace, with the keeper's parallel journey providing secondary tension. The ritual's progression from sharing pain to dissolution provides adequate escalation. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance—the boy accepts the process too readily, and the transformation feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (liberation from pyramid scheme debt) tightens through escalating parallel-dimension messages, physical pressure doubling in the cave, and the bolt transformation sequence. Agency drives the climactic twist of the bolt, though coincidental timing of "when concepts become physical" slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: finding handle → turning crank → hearing confession → breaking handle → revealing truth publicly. The "each rotation a generation, each click a crown hitting flagstones" creates rhythmic pressure. Cost manifests in the broken handle drawing blood and Arin's name erasure, though middle sections could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as each reality shift reveals more about Sir Calen's past failures and future possibilities. The dominant stake—capturing "the shape of possibility"—tightens through the puppet encounter and seed gift, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral until the final trail of black wood shoots.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from personal validation-seeking to potential reunion of button with Marcus, with the dominant stake (proving past wasn't waste) tightening when Rowan commits the bureaucratic transgression of adding undocumented evidence. The cost—risking her position to create possibility—is implied rather than dramatized, weakening the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery (finding the booth) through technical challenge (aligning the heads) to city-wide confrontation with visible cost of capture. The dominant stake—recovering erased histories against state indifference—tightens as drones close in and Mira must complete her mission knowing arrest is inevitable. The final image crystallizes the cost: "hands raised, key still in her fist" while voices flood the city.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—silencing a death prophecy—escalates through meaningful deepening as the prophecy pushes harder to speak its final clause while the saxophonist counters with increasingly costly musical responses. Agency drives the resolution through his deliberate erasure note "so soft it traveled backward." The visible cost (raw throat, physical exhaustion, commitment to daily return) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the folklore before the arbor rises above the cloudline—creates clear time pressure that tightens as "the arbor creaked, drifting higher." The resolution is earned through Mireya's systematic work and final utterance, with visible cost in the transformation of land and memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding floods her and she names the forgotten thing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace mechanical certainty or fluid uncertainty—intensifies through Elias's descent, immersion, and ultimate choice to abandon his workshop. The compass pulling him forward and his "without hesitation" wade into the pool show agency driving escalation. Cost is visible in his trade abandonment and the "years later" section showing his transformed life.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief into meaning) established early and deepens through the mirror scene where "her possible future" appears. The cost is legible when he accepts he cannot retrieve her, only transform the wound. Escalation reads more as accumulative deepening than causal tightening, appropriate to the lens but lacking one sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—collecting the drowned child's giggle—escalates through the harp's interference ("lured by the harp's warped lullaby") forcing Elara to risk using her protective tooth. The deepening occurs when contact produces "a shiver of light" that transforms the giggle from fleeing sound to "round face of a boy." Cost is legible: losing the tooth to integrate the laughter, with other splinters "beginning to stir" suggesting future obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on discovering "the mathematics of mercy" through embodied pain, with escalation through three equations that deepen understanding. The proprioceptive spikes force confrontation with trauma memories, narrowing the path to either acceptance or madness. Final acceptance of approximation ("one unit of mercy extracted from an infinite series") shows earned resignation with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal collection to temporal paradox resolution, with the painting serving as the pressure point. The narrator's agency drives the choice to return the fragment, foreclosing his role as translator. Cost is visible in "its absence weighs more than its presence ever did."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates from initial bargaining through ghost appearances to the final acceptance of carrying them. The dominant stake—whether to engage with what the building needs fixed—tightens when Mara realizes the cracks are in herself. Cost is visible but could be more visceral; the "weightless burden" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake of rupturing perfect systems escalates from stealing the whisper, to printing the forbidden sentence, to the library's complete destabilization. The tightening occurs when "eternity compressed into the moment his pulse skipped"—narrowing all possibility into a single heartbeat. Cost is legible in the library's dissolution and the mirror-keeper fragmenting into "shards reflecting every reader."

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether memory/history can be rewritten—escalates from archaeological dispute through personal wound to the scratching of the mirror. The storm provides natural pressure that forces action during its eye. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation and imagery than decisive turns that narrow options, and Mira's presence doesn't significantly raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The covenant's requirement creates genuine pressure - Elias must offer painful truth to activate the mechanism. Stakes escalate from personal (fixing a music box) to citywide (restoring dawn) to intimate (completing his daughter's lullaby). The cost is visible in his confession about failing his daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through descent, psychometric visions, and the lagoon's demand for tribute, with one meaningful deepening when Ivy realizes "explanations would fail here." The cost manifests in her permanent transformation, though intermediate stakes could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the slide is "gift or geas"—signals early and deepens when Maela discovers the archway is a ledger requiring her participation. Escalation occurs through the slide's projection gaining weight until shadows "leaned against the archway as if pushing it open," forcing Maela to carve with rather than against the wood's memory. The cost manifests in her abandoning modern navigation for uncertain intuitive guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates through seasonal progression and Liora's evolving understanding, with the 1912 postcard's message ("reckon with the shadow") creating a specific challenge she must solve through embodied practice. The stakes deepen when she discovers painting absence rather than light. Minor deduction for relatively gentle escalation that could push harder against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the accumulating exchange system where each configuration of debris prompts deeper revelations, culminating in the mother's betrayal confession. The cost is legible both physically ("years rearrange inside me") and in the final choice to broadcast despite knowing she'll be "crowned or crucified." One meaningful deepening as Mireya progresses from seeking archives to accepting personal shame and choosing public truth.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal exile to communal revival through Veyra's accumulated actions, with the bottle's smashing marking the decisive turn that enables others' return. The deepening occurs through textural accumulation fitting the lens, though the abrupt ending truncates the final cost demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation deepens through accumulation: foghorn silence → wax prophecy → childhood vision → accepting transformation, with the dominant stake (archiving vs. becoming archived) tightening when the orchard itself will vanish. Cost is felt in Ambrose's final waiting, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation from discovering the hatched spiral through surrendering heat, planting precious seeds, to accepting eternal guardianship—each choice narrows future options with visible cost. The dominant stake (preserving the seed heritage/fulfilling grandmother's instructions) tightens as the protagonist realizes she must remain behind. The "furiously tranquil" tension between urgency and patience creates authentic pressure. Doesn't reach 8.0+ because some middle beats feel more accumulative than causally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from technical curiosity about pitch shifts to the moral weight of breaking century-old protocol. The pressure drops (03:17, 03:42) create urgency toward zero hour. Cost is visible when villages wake "believing the old monks had returned" - Mara trades institutional trust for authentic connection.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: reflections lingering → glowing responses → meteor's embedded fleck → vision of origins → final renunciation. The dominant stake (finding meaning in overlooked work) tightens as each interaction costs more vulnerability. The meteor's question about burning/changing crystallizes the choice with clear trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fracture in the glass creates genuine escalation by threatening to release all preserved words, forcing Alden's choice between mending or abandoning. The child ghost's arrival deepens stakes by adding weight that could break the box entirely. Cost is visible in his broken vow, though the final transformation arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to understand time to communal exchange system where "stories became the currency." The timekeeper's sacrifice of his urn fragment for "one genuine shiver" shows meaningful cost. Pressure coheres but could tighten more dramatically between discovery and final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding beauty in incompleteness—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, from the torn feather through the broken zither string to the kite's frayed tail "streaming three separate colors." The poet's agency manifests in harmonizing discord (tuning the broken string, drawing the spiral), though the woman's arrival introduces coincidence that slightly softens earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through biological accumulation: first a sparrow makes the circuit sing, then geckos trigger light pulses, finally all creatures synchronize in "parliament." The tightening occurs when Mateo must choose between remaining observer or becoming participant—he chooses integration with clear physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding the visitors' true purpose) deepens through discoveries: glowing footprints → strange compounds → neural response patterns → emotional harvesting revelation. Pressure accumulates but lacks a sharp tightening moment where Mara must sacrifice something tangible. The "chemistry of homecoming" concept drives investigation without forcing hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (healing the war-torn reef through ritual seeding) is clear. Escalation occurs through accumulation—from scattering seeds to the reef's acceptance to visible growth. Cost is legible in the coachman's permanent wandering state. Minor deduction as the pressure doesn't significantly tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The riddle creates genuine pressure requiring both Scraps' sensory translation and Kite's intuitive understanding to solve. Stakes tighten when the wax leaf must physically kiss the cylinder to unlock coordinates. Cost is visible but the brother's easy emergence slightly deflates the buildup's promise of difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from memorial ritual to confronting impossible phenomena (compass spinning, mother's voice) to the final choice of leaving linear reality. The cost appears in the abandoned jacket and the line about years losing meaning, though the middle section could tighten—the crawlspace discovery feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through the chess match where each move releases intimate secrets, building to Vespers' gambit with the false bishop. The cost manifests in the spire's collapse and Halcyon's departure. One meaningful deepening that reweights the nature of theft/teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes crystallize when Kestrel appears as potential threat, forcing Mara's choice between flight and connection. The meaningful tightening occurs through their chess-game negotiation that transforms opposition into alliance. Cost is visible in accepting permanent exile ("nomadic penumbra inside her").

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen as the protagonist moves from avoiding painful memories to actively seeding truth back into herself despite terror. The feather writing on mercury glass creates tangible risk with visible cost in the glass cracking away, though the middle section's exposition about buried talents dilutes present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from solving-puzzle-for-forgiveness to recognizing-acceptance-requires-forward-movement, with the decoded chess game forcing Marek to see his guilt differently. The cost lands in accepting the teacher's need for self-forgiveness. Minor dock for the resolution feeling slightly predetermined once the pattern is recognized.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (confronting guilt over the queen's death) escalates from external ritual pressure to internal reckoning through the echoing canyon. The cost is visible in accepting the doubled shadow and commitment to paint with her own blood. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira realizes "the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening." Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the ritual threat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal grief (mother's heartbeat) to sacrificial choice as chains snap one by one. The countdown creates undeniable pressure with visible cost as Lira straps herself to the chair knowing she'll drown.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving the quay's memory) escalates from failed painting to discovering the shell's impossible mural to choosing hidden preservation over public display. Cost is visible in Ren's acceptance of anonymity. The accumulative pressure builds well but lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the three-week wait for cooler air to carry subtler frequencies, building toward the dawn ritual. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes her mother "hadn't drowned but had simply learned to travel on vibrations too subtle"—this reweights the loss without resolving it. The fishing boat's course change provides ambiguous confirmation that soft beckoning works.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the three phone calls that progressively demand more sacrifice: maintenance work, then bodily integration (soldering hair), then stepping into the spiral as offering. The cost is legible when she literally dissolves ("stitched seams loosened"). The moon's progression creates temporal pressure that forces action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal safety through involuntary truth-telling to accepting role as orchard's keeper, with storms and the multiplying eyes creating coherent pressure. The cost is legible in the protagonist's transformation from "rational truffle forager" to one who "let[s] whatever needs saying fall out like loose seed," though the sister's arrival feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating gaps (missing gulls, ferry horn, reflection delay) that force Maris to recognize the cyclical trap. The choice to release the Edelweiss carries clear cost—sacrificing personal memories including her mother's song. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the middle investigation could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from searching maps to following supernatural ant trails to confronting the doorway of unmade choices. The flooding creek adds temporal pressure. The revelation of seeing himself age "in fast motion" effectively tightens options toward his final choice. However, the protagonist's agency feels somewhat reactive to discovered elements rather than driving the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preventing kingdom's forgetting) escalates through the queen's climb and discovery of the time loop, with meaningful tightening when she realizes staying will "burn the last of her living memory." The cost is legible in the final transformation, though the middle section could use sharper pressure points rather than discovery-based progression.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    Central tension between preservation and presence escalates through Corin's confession about "selling absence." The crushing of the pocket-sun represents meaningful deepening—destroying his life's work to create genuine shared presence. Cost is visible but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of narrative control versus temporal dissolution deepens through grave discovery, scroll prophecy, and eagle flight, culminating in accepting erasure. The tension between chronicling and being chronicled creates coherent pressure. Missing a sharper tightening moment where options dramatically narrow, though the accumulative pressure works under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether Mira can find meaning without her defining sense. The screw's warmth and micro-scratches create escalating discovery, with cost visible when "tears blurred the loupe." However, external pressure remains gentle—Horace's absence doesn't heighten tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming crystallized grief) tightens through the kettle's rising steam deadline that forces completion despite burning lungs. The typhoon's arrival provides external pressure that enables speaking rather than writing, though the resolution relies partially on Master Jomei's breath-push rather than pure protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—delivering an authentic apology that costs professional identity—escalates through the "imperfect miracle" mechanism where each listening erases a measure. The tightening occurs when Mirage writes her confession knowing it will fade, accepting irreversibility. Cost is legible in her career dissolution and the archive dropping "half a step, forever out of tune with the world."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: dictionary definitions rearranging → library spiraling → memories sliding into the book → final dissolution. The cost is legible as the witness loses "every memory" and ultimately self, though the stakes operate more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through deepening revelations about time's nature, culminating in Torvald's dissolution. The dominant stake—understanding temporal reality—remains consistent. However, the escalation relies heavily on philosophical assertion rather than dramatized cost, and the final transformation arrives without sufficient resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from investigating a breach to confronting personal grief about Luc. The topology discovery meaningfully tightens options leading to the merger choice. Cost is visible in Maya's uncertainty about which Luc is real, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on Mara's need to decode her father's legacy versus maintaining her "responsible" distance. The mezzanine discovery deepens rather than reverses, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is legible in leaving the lantern burning—forsaking the hunt that defined their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of breaking isolation escalates through the child's calls, the reveal of her identity, and the choice at the gate. Agency manifests in both the decision to answer/engage and the final renunciation to remain. Cost is visible in the handed disc and the "soft finality" of the closing gate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory before demolition—tightens through approaching "contractors testing equipment" and the security encounter, forcing the locket sacrifice. Cost is visible in the permanent loss and the daughter's observation. The escalation works under the accumulative lens but could benefit from one more intermediate pressure point between arrival and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on finding someone to share the moon fragment's cure for loneliness. The knock-knock joke exchange provides the key turn where mutual recognition enables the cure. Cost is visible when both taste "chalk, static, and the faint sweetness of shared orbit," though escalation relies more on accumulation than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from external mapmaking to confronting "his own interior stayed blank, a parchment he feared to touch." The musical trail tightening into a spiral creates accumulative pressure that forces entry at the stillpoint. Cost is legible when he must "become the map, parchment and ink and reader all at once"—foreclosing his previous distance from emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—correcting the communication error while accepting uncertainty—develops through one meaningful deepening as Mira shifts from trying to fix her mistake to embracing uncertainty as necessary. Cost appears in the "propagated echoes" she knows she'll face and the energy borrowed from the station. The escalation feels more textural than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - mapping silence until it becomes music - deepens through accumulation as Elara progresses from photographing absence to conducting the harbor's quiet. The transformation from passive documentation to active composition shows meaningful escalation, though pressure could intensify more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes center on rescuing the grandmother's promise, but this remains abstract—we never learn what truth the tapestry reveals beyond vague claims about "knowledge that must be burned clean." The protagonist faces no opposition or difficult choices; the tapestry simply glows and reveals itself. No meaningful tightening occurs as Ember proceeds unopposed through discovery to exit.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on reuniting with Lila through transformation, with clear escalation from tentative drumming to full dissolution. The cost is unmistakable—Mara's physical form dispersing. Minor deduction as the middle section relies more on reflection than active pressure, though the accumulative lens supports this approach.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from navigation challenge to historical mystery to fundamental misunderstanding of the labyrinth's purpose, with the storm creating temporal pressure. The acoustic discovery reweights Mira's professional knowledge with visible cost—her maps were incomplete. Slight deduction for the convenient alignment of storm, inheritance, and Mira's presence, though the "calculated spontaneity" framing partially justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching darkness to value stars—progresses through accumulating pattern-work with shutters, deepening as darkness learns to hold light "without being destroyed." Cost is visible in her lost voice and eternal repetition. Missing a sharper tightening moment where options narrow dramatically, though the accumulative design doesn't require reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on rebellion against fixed games/rules, signaled early through chess metaphors and Ellis's refusal to sacrifice pieces. The window display sequence deepens pressure through accumulation rather than reversal. Cost manifests in characters' confessions of small rebellions, though the immediate price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freedom versus duty—is established early and tightens when the council arrives with reconstruction plans while Lira builds her escape raft. The whale's call creates escalating pressure that "pry[s] at guarded hearts," though the resolution on the disappearing island lacks the visceral cost of her departure scene. The harpoon transformation provides a meaningful deepening but feels slightly detached from the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from personal grief cultivation to collective valley healing as the officer joins the whittling and the crow participates. The performer's agency drives escalation through narrating, planting stems, and "watering nothing with an empty can" until sky responds. Cost is visible in the "skeleton honest enough to carry future blossoms" and grief being "allowed to weigh something."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming fixed law into fluid possibility—intensifies through escalating risk as she moves from touching quartz to speaking prohibition to stepping onto dissolving ice, with the explicit threat of becoming "a statue of precedent." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each action deepens transformation: pillars shift pitch, ice becomes membrane/mist/chorus, city reflections waver. The cost lands in both personal dissolution and societal uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Milo's search for color/beauty, deepening through the bartered exchange and plant arrangements until the revelation that "broken things sing louder." The cost is visible in Milo never painting again. Escalation could be sharper through the middle movements.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: questioning assumptions → collective uncertainty → transformation → new creation. The "powerfully gentle" carbide lens refracts possibility throughout. Cost is clear in abandoning preservation for uncertain creation, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - transforming grief from preservation to acceptance - intensifies through the accumulation of origami placements, each carrying deeper meaning about "withering and blooming." The cost is legible in the final departure and the decade of solitude. Minor deduction as the pressure builds steadily rather than through sharp reversals, though this fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding cultural collapse through cartographic divination—builds through ritual accumulation. The discovery of "a repeating sigil of leveraged debt" that recurs "no matter how she multiplied paths" represents a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge. The cost appears in her acceptance that "no human wanted to hear the prophecy anymore," though agency remains primarily observational rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from touching the pagoda, to navigating hostile algorithms, to confronting the archive's offer of eternal librarian role, to choosing communal memory-keeping. The "steadily unpredictable" path requirement creates consistent pressure. Cost manifests in her transformation from veiled historian to "woman with weathered hands," though middle development could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through the stone's warming, its metamorphosis into a tiny planet, and Mira's recognition that hope must remain unshareable—each deepening narrows her options toward self-erasure. The cost is legible when she becomes "the last dusk itself," though middle pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Miren can reconstruct her creed after betrayal—accumulates pressure through ritual acts. Each shed layer (ring, braid, papers) deepens the cost, culminating in releasing Aster. The escalation follows the textural lens appropriately, though the conflict remains largely internal without external complication after the inciting scandal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the deepening realization that releasing the miracle requires "fresh loss" and reopening the wound. The protagonist's agency drives the blood offering and acceptance of cost. One meaningful tightening when the trade requirement is revealed, narrowing options to sacrifice or abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding mother's lost message—intensifies through accumulating discoveries: vision in crystal sphere, film moving independently, mother's voice emerging, cigarette case revelation. Each discovery narrows Mara's understanding until she must accept that love requires projection rather than possession. The cost manifests in breaking the seal (irreversible action) and accepting her mother's absence while gaining the ability to project stored love.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal ("remember stardust before it calcified") to universal ("every artist born after her would wake up colorblind in the soul"). The pressure deepens through the three meteor messages building to dissolution, with agency maintained through her choice to dismantle and lie within the design.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving children's essence after catastrophic loss—deepens through accumulation: phantom boxcar weight, names as charms, wave-function materialization, spark-breathing transformation. The guard's agency manifests in his ritual choices (planting the clock face-down, singing names "through wave functions") that enable the children's transformation. Cost is visible in the spectral state of everything—no restoration, only transmutation of loss into light-carriers.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Central tension between holding the gear (certainty/rootedness) versus releasing it (wonder/distribution) escalates through the jaguar's ultimatum: "you must give away the thing that keeps you rooted." The cost is immediate—"Without the gear she might forget her name entirely"—and paid when she drops it, triggering dissolution. Stakes deepen rather than reverse, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on restoring cosmic balance through finding the guardian. Pressure builds through the journey's increasing disorientation and the hound's mournful howl. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost—the hound's choice feels predetermined rather than fought for, and no concrete price is paid for the restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding "the cost of safety paid in voices") is signaled early and deepens through the boy's surgery scene. The bellhop's agency manifests through his vigil and the bolt-passing ritual. However, escalation remains somewhat static—the fortress "deciding" at the end deflects some agency from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation from searching to baiting to direct confrontation, with the titan's agency driving each phase through marginalia clues. The stakes—cosmic balance thrown off by false sovereignty—manifest concretely when the glamour unravels. The pretender's pride creating his downfall ("pride muffled caution") adds psychological pressure, though the titan faces no personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from routine monitoring to discovering the hidden message to underwater exploration, with each discovery narrowing Mira's path forward. The tapping pattern creates coherent pressure linking surface to depths. Cost is visible in Mira's acceptance of perpetual witness duty, though the middle section could tighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal observation to planetary liberation as the stone circle's hum transforms her from witness to catalyst. The tightening occurs when she must choose between escape and broadcasting the lullaby, though the rebellion context could pressure her decision more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (subverting genetic control) signaled early and escalates through discovery of kite coordinates, descent into grotto, guard encounter, and successful alteration. The guard encounter provides meaningful tightening that forces immediate action. Cost is visible in Nara's physical struggle and risk, though the soporific resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from carrying the photograph to the "freeze" exercise to releasing it while preserving Nadia's image in resin. The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—deepens through somatic markers that "glow" as small lighthouses, with cost visible in tearing paper and salt tears.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (painting the lost beloved's face) established early and pressure tightens through the lighthouse's progressive collapse, forcing Elian's final choice. The accumulative pressure of disintegration—books toppling, walls pressing, foundation crumbling—creates escalation consistent with the textural lens. Cost is legible in the final dissolution, though agency feels more like surrender than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding a missing sister to understanding time's defense mechanism to choosing temporal dissolution. The deepening occurs through Lyra's journal revelation that time-slowing is intentional protection, forcing Kael's decision between linear existence and understanding. Cost manifests as voluntary surrender to "folded moments" where one lives "a thousand years in a single heartbeat."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery to societal upheaval through Sera's agency, with the ticking clock of potential re-freezing creating urgency. The cost is explicit: "the library would either stand reborn or fall purified by flame." One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera commits to uploading despite knowing the consequences, though the resolution's scope (city-wide revelation) feels slightly rushed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming violent legacy into peaceful continuity—deepens through Mira's methodical grafting work, with the sandbag scrap serving as the catalyst. While agency drives the resolution, escalation relies more on accumulation than active tightening; the "three days prior" timeline could create more urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—catching divine echo—escalates when the goddess threatens to "burn the garden silent," forcing Mara's decisive spike action. The cost manifests in the garden's relief and transformation, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between Mara's calm and the goddess's demand.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from inscribing assumptions to forcing contradictions to breaking the nib. The orbit "flared white, refusing the contradiction" before finally cracking open. Cost is legible in the splintered rosewood—destroying the grandfather's relic to destroy the false orbit.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from seeking silence → discovering the boy's cry → letters revealing her marks as nodes → being tethered by paper chains → facing the trade (voice for silence). The console's menu progression (TRANSLATE/RESTORE/ERASE → UPGRADE/BECOME/RELEASE) tightens options effectively. Cost is visible when she must slice chains to make her choice. Slight deduction for the middle section where pressure briefly plateaus during letter revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from listening to the grotto, to creating the mandala, to receiving the tile's message, to destroying her creation. The dominant stake (finding meaning in impermanence) tightens when she must destroy what she's built. Cost is visible in the scattered sand and her acceptance of endless cycles of creation/erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through Asha's methodical tessera collection building to the dawn revelation that she's constructing "empathy's armor," with the dominant stake (how to honor both memory and forgetting) crystallizing in her final artistic choice. The cost manifests in her self-exile and the abandoned "self-righteous speeches," though the middle section could tighten the connection between vision and action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—the ghost's need for substantiality through applause—accumulates pressure as temporal threads layer and echo. The climactic moment where "every performance was happening at once" represents meaningful deepening, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once Lila appears, reducing the sense of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding/accepting telepathic connection—escalates from personal sensation to collective revelation. Maya's agency drives the illumination of connections between strangers. However, the resolution comes too easily without meaningful resistance or cost; the other artists simply accept and participate without skepticism, deflating potential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mapping emotions to becoming their voice, with the fossil's cold node disrupting Aera's method and forcing physical transformation. The cost is legible when "each sonic layer wrapped itself around the fossil" drains her body, though the pressure could tighten more sharply between discovery and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal duty (turning the hourglass) through prophetic crisis to collective possibility, with the button spiral as decisive action. Cost is legible in abandoning the monastery role, though middle pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal redemption to exposing the director's betrayal of four teams, with the transmission as irreversible action. The cost lands through crushing the pillbox—destroying his last connection to Sera—and accepting whatever consequences follow.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (distilling thirty years into essence before silence) established early through the palimpsest promise. Meaningful deepening occurs when threading memories transforms both landscape and identity. The ticking gutters create genuine time pressure. Cost is visible in the abandoned coach and lost profession, though agency reads more as acceptance than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation follows accumulative deepening as the thrum intensifies from "faint" to "splitting one moment into many," forcing Lin's clay-hive response. The dominant stake—whether kindness can persist in devastation—tightens when the bees impossibly return, accepting her "promise." Cost remains somewhat abstract (the oasis will vanish again) rather than immediately visceral, though Lin's departure while the child arrives creates a genuine foreclosure of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on bringing proof of sky to a trapped child, with clear escalation through the lock-picking risk and descent into darkness. The "quivering hush" effectively marks tension points. Cost manifests in the sacrificed tooth and dissolved petal, though the immediate danger could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—trading memory for momentum, transforming isolation into independence—develops through clear stages: awakening, seeking the hum, reaching the henge, ascending through clouds. The cost appears in "each hoof-fall erasing the need for another quagga beside her." The escalation from passive remembering to active self-illumination works under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering authentic voice after years of ghostwriting—deepens through the elderly woman encounter and culminates in the art installation scene. The cost accumulates through "ink still seeping," "palimpsest heart," and the final choice to sign her own name, though one more turn of pressure would strengthen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery to humanity's survival, with armed militias and the lunar eclipse providing temporal pressure. The tricksters' manipulation creates genuine conflict, but Mara's agency feels limited—she executes a predetermined solution rather than making difficult choices. The resolution lacks visible cost despite claims of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure coheres around finding the key where "echoes mutiny against the ear," with the organ's impossible presence creating spatial distortion. While the stakes tighten when Arin must descend despite her claustrophobia, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off beyond accepting internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: methodical research → ribbon fragment discovery → paint mixing with fibers → canvas fever → mask emergence → bodies revealed. The dominant stake (awakening town's amnesia) tightens when the painting literally pulls the mask from water. Cost appears in "bodies lifted into light" but could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (cataloging journals) through collaborative (Voss joining the search) to transformative (creating the sky-library). The question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?" forces Voss's reversal. Cost is visible when Mara chooses extended exile over return, though middle pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming "never" into possibility through music—deepens as the glass flake warms and pixels loosen, building toward her choice to take the hitchhiker's reconstructed hand. The scaffold wrap language creates persistent constraint (she can only read his path through wind patterns). However, the escalation relies heavily on metaphorical intensification rather than concrete pressure, and the final transformation lacks tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as each discovered marker deepens understanding, culminating in the choice to release the money rather than keep it. The cost is visible—abandoning both inheritances (father's collection and startup equity). Stakes could be more viscerally felt in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as inscriptions reveal increasing layers of meaning, culminating in shared burden becoming shared light. The chronicler's agency drives the transformation through speaking petal-syllables. Cost is visible but could be more viscerally felt in the body rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—confronting the unspoken confession—is signaled early and tightens through the circular journey. The moment of stillness at the seventh circle creates meaningful escalation. However, the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond Briar's internal resistance, limiting the pressure compared to what the premise could deliver.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with lost dreams/covenant—deepens through the maze journey and gardener's choice. Agency manifests through accepting the scar-plant rather than choosing to prune or graft. Cost is visible (permanent transformation) but the escalation feels more accumulative than sharply pressured, fitting the textural lens but lacking urgent tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal healing to understanding that "patching souls is not sewing shut but weaving new cloth," with the memory trade creating irreversible cost. The reversal when Lira collapses ("patching one soul might pucker another") deepens conflict, though the resolution's ease when she recovers her stride slightly deflates accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure—tightens when Mara discovers the orange paint speck and realizes "being needed" trumps applause. However, the resolution through a phone call lacks the visceral pressure of earlier beats; the transformation feels slightly too neat given the depth of her earlier despair.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulating translations that narrow Mira's understanding from abstract "physics of transition" to personal grief resolution. The seed's increasing heat and the silver plant's emergence create pressure. Cost is visible when she accepts her mother's pattern rather than physical return—a meaningful trade-off that forecloses reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of preserving wonder/memory against dissolution coheres throughout, with meaningful deepening as identities resist fusion then yield to the litany. Cost is legible in accepting future dissolution and the "hollow adjusting around absence." However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment—pressure accumulates steadily rather than pivoting decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through deepening reveals (confessions→builders' silhouettes→mother's face) that reweight Mara's understanding. The crown moment forces decisive acceptance with visible cost. Stakes could be sharper earlier, but the accumulative tightening toward merger works under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation reads through accumulated weight—from pill dissolution through map-making to playing the accordion to releasing the paper boat, each gesture forecloses the obsessive chronicling path. The "twelve-year-old who feared the rope more than the loss" crystallizes the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating propagation delays (shadow arriving later, watch stuttering, time snapping elastic) that narrow her options toward the final grab. The cost of trading memory for access and having her lie restored demonstrates clear price, though the truncated ending slightly dulls the final pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake: play the violin for tyrannical order or refuse for chaotic freedom. Escalation through the fracture she creates, widening the choice's consequences. Cost becomes visible when the violin transforms and she vanishes, her name becoming rumors.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preserving memory against oblivion, with pressure building through the accumulation of "three hundred and forty-two" death patterns. The transformation carries clear cost as she sacrifices herself to become "a lantern" for the dead, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on contentment-seeking after forgiveness, with one meaningful deepening when the boy reveals himself as "the next you." The hairpin's transformation sequence (stabbing cliff, fusing with shell, internalizing) creates escalation through accumulation. Cost becomes visible in the caretaker's death-into-renewal, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (moral certainty vs. ecological destruction) signals early and tightens when Mira offers the unprecedented choice. The researchers' transformation from confident certainty to "protected vulnerability" shows clear cost. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns, with the single major tightening coming late.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transmitting crucial knowledge before Elara vanishes—maintains consistent pressure through her accelerating regression. The pond rings create escalating revelations that deepen understanding rather than reverse it. Cost is visible in Elara's physical dissolution, though Marcus's agency in the climax could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of finding/becoming the wandering pulse is signaled early but escalation is minimal—Cael arrives, sings, and transforms without meaningful resistance or complication. The cost of becoming rooted/still reads more as fulfillment than sacrifice, lacking the tension needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through Elian's agency: unstrapping bands → stepping through → taking petal → keystone fracturing, with clear cost at each stage. The dominant stake (finding authentic wonder vs automated miracle) tightens when the doorway begins shrinking "driven by curfew subroutines." Slightly lower score because the middle section could use one more beat of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from personal quest to cosmic understanding as Jin risks drowning to reach the safe, with tension in "one wrong exhale could collapse the delicate archive." The phonograph's revelation that "every human sound is merely light still searching for an eye" reweights his entire pursuit. Cost manifests in Jin abandoning his duty and accepting transformation rather than mere discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake - preserving meaning before universal collapse - escalates through the coins' dissolution revealing the prophecy's true demand: "you must become the static." Cost is visceral as Elara's atoms distill. The tension between purpose and dissolution creates genuine pressure, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: atlas monsters becoming sacrifices, star-sentences forming questions, finally the mirror revealing his parasitic existence. The cost lands powerfully—"every soul he reaped had paid some fraction of their death to postpone his own"—though mid-story density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (rebuilding the vanished ocean) escalates through the dripping rate acceleration and expanding manifestations (drop→minnow→wave→dolphin→ocean). Kael's brittle devotion faces genuine test when the dolphin warns "You've rebuilt the sea, but not the faith," forcing his lifetime commitment. The cost accumulates visibly through aging and death.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling personal history with communal duty—deepens through the photograph trail leading to father's secret, forcing Marisol's choice between private grief and public service. Escalation is present but relies more on accumulation than decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on proving "reason and reverence could share one crucible," with meaningful escalation when dissolving the crystal risks either weaving wonder into reality or unraveling knowable/unknown boundaries. The starling flock's return creates pattern-based tightening. Cost manifests in the irreversible transformation, though agency feels slightly passive during the middle search sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of trust/vigilance deepens through the glider's arrival using stolen signals, forcing recalibration. The choice to descend and offer the buckle represents meaningful agency with cost. Escalation could be sharper - the encounter's stakes feel slightly abstract despite the network exposure threat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from custody battle to existential merger, with each confession round raising emotional cost. The "dissolve into narrative fog" threat creates real pressure. Zero's faltering at naming fear becomes the pivot. Cost is visible in the lost individual selves.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: seed arrival → planting urgency → architectural transformation → guests as pollinators. The cost manifests as Mira surrendering design control to become "puzzle and planter alike." One meaningful deepening occurs when the building begins breathing with guests, though agency sometimes feels reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (restoring laughter/preserving memory) deepens from mechanical noise-making to accepting absence with new form. The escalation through "killed the throttle" to hearing the impossible sniffle creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible in Ellery sinking to his knees and the permanence of the tunnel's haunting, though the wife's laughter slightly softens the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—befriending uncertainty through dissolution—deepens progressively as the guardian moves from waiting for answers to "waiting within the questions themselves," culminating in her acceptance of becoming the garden. The pendant's transformation from external gift to internalized heartbeat marks clear escalation. Cost is visible but could be more viscerally felt in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through the ritual's progression from arrangement to blood sacrifice to creature birth. The acceptance of "the next cage may be stranger" and voluntary blindness show escalating cost, though middle sections could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preventing the shard from eating transmissions to discovering it protects "what came before the noise began." The interpreter's agency drives the deepening through deliberate assumption-shedding and tuning adjustments. Cost is visible in the fragment's sublimation, though the conflict could benefit from more immediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the grotto closing ("stalactites knitting together like fingers after prayer") and the hourglass burning through Arden's coat, forcing the urgent choice between timelines. The cost materializes in accepting a "permanent transient life," though the middle section could tighten the pressure more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of "discovering the texture of connection" progresses through accumulation rather than escalation—the weaving continues without meaningful resistance or trade-offs. No clear tightening occurs; the gallery "settles" and the architect departs without foreclosing options or paying visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (learning to navigate in a transformed world) intensifies through the boy's question "can we go back?" which forces the instructor to confront truth versus comfort. The meaningful deepening occurs when she gives him the chain link, foreclosing her own connection to the past with felt cost. However, external pressure remains somewhat static after the alien craft passes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to fulfilling a decades-old promise with clear emotional cost. The pressure builds through pulse-tracking to name-finding to the climactic meeting. Agency manifests through Mira's choice to deliver the message despite her limited role.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing the forgotten to physically merging with their prison-reality, with Mara's claustrophobia providing internal pressure against external necessity. The phase transition mechanism tightens options progressively, forcing deeper descent and closer contact with the horror. Cost manifests in her transformation from fearing enclosed spaces to bearing "the wider fear—and obligation—of remembering."

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mere survival to understanding how "life can hinge on a typo," then deepen to the choice of whether to remain ghostly or return to help the clerk. The ticking heartbeat count creates temporal pressure toward dawn's correction. Agency drives the resolution through the narrator's decision to slice his digital film and return. Cost is legible in abandoning his safe liminal state.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from preserving memory to accepting the curse to complete calcification. The storyteller's agency drives each deepening—pressing ear to wall, descending tunnel, swallowing diamond—with mounting cost visible in her slowing heartbeat and bodily transformation. The trade-off between life and voice preservation lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the wraith and finding the mentor—escalates through the phone confession revealing the mentor's present voice, then deepens when Vale realizes her bitterness is "the final ingredient." The transformation carries cost (Vale leaves her old life), though agency becomes passive as she "allowed the arrowhead to guide her metamorphosis" rather than actively choosing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are immediately clear: extracting beauty before calcification. The musical reversal that makes "statues' eyelids drooped, eyelids that had never been designed to close" provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Calla's dissolution and the orchard's permanent transformation, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once the musical pattern is discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk through the thunderstorm release to the collective arcade shutdown, with the virus deployment as the decisive irreversible act. The border drones' algorithmic suspicion creates genuine pressure that forces the protagonist's timing. Cost manifests through Sal's complicity and the arcade's sacrificial darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in silence—escalates from physical search through the warped corridor's temporal distortion to the halo fragment's revelation. The carpenter's agency drives the search and transformation, though the fragment lifting "of its own accord" slightly weakens agency at the crucial moment. Cost accumulates through abandoned craft and the final choice to follow music over wood.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories live—escalates through spatial distortion and the scarf's increasing pull toward revelation, with clear cost in the scarf's destruction. The hyperbolic fold sequence effectively tightens pressure as "each step shorter than the last yet covering more distance." However, the middle section relies somewhat on accumulation over active agency, and the resolution arrives through discovery more than earned confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (capturing her runaway dream) to communal restoration (voices of the erased), with clear tightening when the dream appears as "a folded paper boat burning cold fire." The cost is visceral—"Light imploded into the lens, the palette cracked"—though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (freeing the idea of peace) signals early and tightens through the lock's resistance and fear of speaking. The cost is legible when the idea leaps free, transforming the nexus. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locksmith discovers his participation in the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) escalates through Mara's discovery that she "offered" them rather than had them stolen, forcing a recalibration of agency. The tension peaks when she must choose between completing the exchange for "the safety of forgetting" or cutting the mushroom to reclaim painful memories, with the cost visible in accepting "the pain of loss."

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    The reversible exile's cruel bargain (return home but forget why you wanted to) establishes clear stakes that deepen when Lira discovers she could save the library by becoming "bound and shelved." Her choice to rewrite the exile for the child shows agency with visible cost. Escalation through accumulation works under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) escalates from personal mission to world-changing release when the weave "tugged back, hungry for borrowed brilliance." The reversal from capturing to releasing creates meaningful pressure with visible cost—the loom's destruction and Arin's transformation. The final image of the sapling "half in soil, half in dream" crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: each untied knot adds weight to the "accumulating silence" while paradoxically lightening the burden, culminating in Mirel's recognition that the final knot holds her own buried truth. The cost—abandoning her life's purpose—is legible when she chooses freedom over perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through the mystery's layers (torn map → film evidence → physical henge → transformative silence), with meaningful deepening when Elara chooses patient witnessing over conquest. The cost manifests in her acceptance of "mystery rather than mastery," though escalation could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through deepening understanding rather than external conflict—from finding Earhart's plane to recognizing her own search's futility to accepting grief's transformation. The snow globe's deliberate unsealing and repurposing with dog tags creates irreversible change with clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—articulating needs before erasure—escalates through the echo's challenge and culminates in Lyra's choice to release rather than preserve. The time pressure between lightning and thunder creates urgency. The transformation from individual preservation to communal release shows clear cost in letting go of control.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about captain's death through diary discovery to choosing the hothouse over servitude. The dominant stake—finding joy beneath sorrow—tightens when Lira must forfeit her ascending position. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the cable's progressive failure ("each pop a syllable in the sky's last sentence") forcing Mara to accelerate her documentation. The dominant stake—preserving her mother's theory before the gondola falls—tightens as altitude drops from 31,000 to 30,600 feet. Cost is legible in Mara's final transformation where she becomes the proof itself.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The demolition countdown creates coherent time pressure that forces faster painting, but the artist's agency remains primarily observational until the final choice to leave. The dominant stake—preserving the sky's memory before destruction—deepens when she discovers the coin's code, though this arrives late without earlier tactical shifts. Cost becomes visible when she walks out "carrying nothing but her brushes," abandoning her final work.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the ship from becoming "another blank space on someone else's map"—escalates from dimming lights to the revelation that "the light-feed runs on stories, not coal." This tightening forces Lira's decisive action, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the problem's introduction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair" to heal Rowan's irregular heartbeat—accumulates through the mirror sequence where "none sang" initially creates genuine tension. The reversal when Rowan realizes the mirrors store "better versions, drafts the universe discarded" meaningfully tightens options and forces the choice to use his flawed key. The cost is legible when "the door locked itself" behind him, though the final expansion to cosmic scope slightly dilutes the personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual ghost-human trust to collective survival through the dying anti-grav seeds, with the coordinated harvest requiring specific human-chain formations. The cost manifests physically as Mara becomes "the counterweight no scale had predicted," though the resolution feels slightly too smooth given the initial mistrust.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through the lullaby's iterations, each revealing greater cost until the final bargain crystallizes. The adjuster's agency drives the accumulation—she chooses each recursive loop knowing it brings her closer to dissolution. The visible price ("voice eternally whispering, body eroding") lands with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the tightening frost deadline and the travelers' wrong turn toward "deceptive moonlight," forcing Mara to innovate with the nut-kernel solution. The cost is visible in Mara's physical toll and her perpetual imprisonment. Slight deduction as the middle section could have one more turn where Mara's method nearly fails.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into connection—escalates from personal (scattering ashes) through scientific (creating the resin) to communal (sharing the sculptures). The wind stealing the ashes creates meaningful pressure that forces innovation. Cost is visible when Mara walks away, leaving her creation for strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake of "incising the day" to find "where stories begin" signals early but remains conceptually abstract. Escalation occurs through accumulating transactions that make the library heavier until it threatens to fall, forcing the vendor's self-erasure. However, the pressure feels more philosophical than visceral—customers want "beginnings they lack" but the actual cost of these absences never fully dramatizes. The vendor's agency drives the resolution but the stakes remain oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure as memories layer from human to oceanic to geological time scales. The cost of being "subsumed" is clear, though the reversal moment could use sharper causal mechanics. Stakes deepen effectively from personal curse to land's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical failure (the cuckoo cannot strike) through systemic breakdown (farmers wait in isolation) to existential separation between human need and mechanical memory. The elevator's ultimatum ("Build me a bridge, librarian, or let me rot") crystallizes the central conflict, with Mireya's vigil and linguistic braiding providing agency-driven resolution, though the transformation occurs somewhat smoothly without sharper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk (motor cortex overwrite) through the helmet sequence to the collapse when moonlight shifts. The dominant stake—recovering abandoned dreams—tightens when the angle requirement proves unsustainable. Cost is visible in blood and equipment loss, though the middle section's pressure could intensify more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the manuscript's increasing luminosity, the doodle's animation, and Ilyra's recognition that the grotto feeds on memory failure, forcing her climactic choice. The cost is unmistakable—she dissolves into the collection she once catalogued—though the "third option" slightly undercuts the binary's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds through the accumulation of ritual gestures—mapping cracks, matching heartbeats, playing each fissure—culminating in the grove joining the song. The stakes (restoring music before memory fades) are clear, though the conflict remains primarily internal without strong opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the internal conflict between accepting exile and finding new purpose provides some tension, there's no meaningful escalation or tightening of pressure. The tutor's meditation proceeds without opposition or complication, and his decision to teach "one final student" faces no obstacles or costs that would create genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through frequency progression (200-400-600-714 kHz) with each silence variety deepening stakes. The diary's clasp warming and eventual opening provides meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in Mirelle's choice to carry stories "in her bloodstream." Slightly mechanical progression of silence types prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of achieving serenity through the grafting intensifies well, with the seed's precarious balance between fusion and destruction creating genuine tension. The tide reversal and wind spirits add pressure. Cost is clear in the decade-long commitment and the surrendered notebook.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering source of resilience) escalates through physical journey to metaphysical understanding. The gravity inversion creates natural pressure and deadline. Cost is visible in the reciprocal exchange of memories. Minor deduction as the conflict is primarily internal discovery rather than contested opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds effectively through accumulating wind speeds (forty knots to two hundred), tightening spiral, and final collapse. The investigator's agency drives discovery and escape, though the middle section could tighten—several paragraphs repeat wind documentation without deepening pressure. Cost is clear: Marcus's death, the town's evacuation, the port's consumption.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear dominant stake of certifying wonder "as essential to the world's continuing rotation" with precise temporal pressure—must strike simultaneously with the sculptor's chisel. The tightening moment where "time narrowed to the space between heartbeats" forces the precise action, and the cost manifests in the cracked bell and the permanent alteration of reality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads through accumulative deepening: from arranging markers to breathing silence to confronting her mirror-self, each beat tightens options toward the final renunciation. The cost is legible in leaving behind the object "that had never left her side," though middle development could show more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: borrowed grief → halo's autonomous message → astronomer's consciousness overlay → child of light revelation → the forced choice between keeping borrowed souls or restoring stars. The cost crystallizes when Quince must "scatter every borrowed soul he carried, returning them to owners who no longer existed."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder against "the fade from memory to myth") established early and deepens through the encounter. The pendant's intensifying vibration creates escalating pressure, and Elias's final choice to "step beyond teaching into transformation" carries visible cost—loss of ordinary existence. Some middle development feels slightly abstract rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through Elian's progression from first lie ("I have let you go") through admission ("I need you still") to final acceptance ("Keep the colors; I'll keep the hush"). Each truthful lie tightens his options for maintaining connection. The cost manifests in the prism's fracture mirroring his internal break—though some middle passages lack immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (carrying a message across impossible distance) escalates through the puzzle discovery to voice sacrifice, with visible cost when she loses speech. However, the puzzle's convenient appearance and the vague nature of the "message" and its recipient dilute dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal debt to planetary liberation, with the moonrise deadline creating urgency. The silk's transformation into a weapon and the arches' trembling response show clear tightening of options. The magicians' attempt to bargain for "partial control" demonstrates real cost in their yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal exploration to discovering her lover's fate and her own complicity. The pressure accumulates through parallel universe revelations, though the middle section could tighten. Cost is legible in her decision to redirect all future work.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—maintaining connection through absence—intensifies when "the lamp had coughed twice before surrendering." The escalation from finding stones seven years ago to tonight's fear "the keeper might finally have stepped over the rail" creates meaningful pressure. The final stone click confirming "she was still keeping, still asking" provides resolution with the cost of continued separation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining routine to birthing a new reality, with meaningful deepening when Lirael must "laugh again, but this time with shadowed elation" knowing the cost. The tension builds through accumulation rather than reversal, though some escalation feels declared ("every chuckle would erase a star") rather than viscerally experienced through concrete pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding the donor's magnetism) drives consistent pressure through physical journey and emotional discovery. The morpho wing's transformation and the vision of miners create meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Kael's absorption of the donor's stories, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from repairing an instrument to discovering trees' quantified sorrow to transmuting grief itself. The pin drop marks the crucial temporal threshold. Cost manifests in the astronomer's collapse and the sextant's broken joints from bearing unmeasurable grief.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory recovery to realm salvation through the keeper's realization that "every mirror refused to reflect another's light," forcing her to alter the lullaby into communal invitation. The mica window's shattering represents irreversible commitment with immediate physical cost. Pressure coheres under accumulative logic as silence, tarry vines, and fragmented memory all converge at the greenhouse heart.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates from guilt over three deaths through Vale's approach to the final surrender, with the midnight purge creating temporal urgency. The choice to "stay while leaving" represents genuine agency with irreversible cost. Stakes remain coherent under the textural lens as paradoxes accumulate toward transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on memory versus erasure with escalation from noticing disappearances to finding bread to planting it to witnessing revival. The gardener's warning about "tenuous absolution" creates constraint, though the actual cost of failure (what happens if memory fully erases) remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate from measuring vows to confronting personal erasure when the library begins archiving the chief herself. The pressure crystallizes in her choice between continuing measurement (becoming another slide) or breaking the pattern. Cost is legible when she extinguishes the lantern "not as defeat but as space."

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing trust breaking by surrendering the family heirloom—tightens as hours pass without father's arrival, forcing the narrator to confront that his absence itself breaks trust. Cost is legible in the final trade, though escalation relies more on internal accumulation than external pressure shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the weather-carriers' arrival sequence, each adding pressure that forces Mira's understanding. The forest election provides meaningful deepening that reweights her role. Cost appears in her life dedication, though the immediate scene cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reconciling with mother's artistic legacy versus remaining trapped by memory) escalates through the discovery and completion of the unfinished portrait. The lock's transformation and the cave's response create meaningful deepening. However, the resolution relies partially on magical coincidence rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on recovering authentic communication in a world where "conversations had begun to disappear." The map's warning "Speak true or the path closes" creates immediate pressure that tests Lira at each junction. The escalation through answering questions and revealing vulnerability works, though the final discovery lacks a decisive trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: years of silent work → final calibration → comet arrival → sculpture activation. The dominant stake (preserving wonder's frequency) tightens as the comet approaches, with visible cost in the tuner's mute sacrifice and final departure. Agency manifests through precise calibration choices, though the comet's role as external catalyst slightly dilutes protagonist-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The magnetic countdown creates steady pressure, and K-17's choice to merge with the box and plant itself shows agency with clear cost. However, the middle lacks dramatized opposition - the android's internal conflict between protocols stays abstract rather than manifesting in contested actions. The escalation through miniaturization works but needed more embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from curiosity about the rattling mailbox through collective memory of Dr. Samara to the community's need for witnessed grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mira abandons her tools and accepts witnessing over solving, with visible cost in transforming her shop's purpose, though intermediate pressure points could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving/transmitting the scientists' encryption of human vulnerability) escalates through physical risk when Mara surrenders to the vortex and swallows the page. The spider's web completion creates genuine time pressure. Cost is legible when she becomes the living vessel for dangerous data.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres through accumulating sensory details until the gravity surge triggers the memory projection, forcing Mael to sacrifice her matchbook to stabilize the vision. The cost manifests physically (flowers crumble to pigment) and emotionally (embracing absence alongside recovery), though the single-beat resolution limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (stopping the prophecy from spreading) escalates from personal ritual to active confrontation when "prophecy fights back" as cricket-encoded drumbeats. The summoner's choice to swallow the sphere shows agency with clear cost. However, the resolution feels slightly too easy—the prophecy's resistance could have been more formidable to heighten the final sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulation—from teaching exchange to supernatural revelation to role inheritance—with the gargoyle's awakening forcing stance crystallization. The cost of becoming the next keeper is visible, though pressure could intensify more sharply between the tutor's transparency and the narrator's acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (recovering quarantined memory) escalates through concrete cost—Mara must sacrifice color vision syllable by syllable as she transfers the memory. The tightening is visceral: "each syllable she sang cost a corresponding color from her vision." Minor deduction for the resolution's ease once the mechanism is understood; the Bureau's opposition remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (forgiveness vs vengeance) deepens through blood-writing that mirrors sister's death, with visible cost in leaving behind the thorn. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens as seventeen years of "calibrated treason" culminates in self-forgiveness. Minor issue: the external conflict (regime) remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—ensuring one's life doesn't become "a hollow vibration"—escalates through Lira's descent into the nexus, discovery of her mother's trapped echo, and choice to complete the farewell. Cost is visible when she releases her mother's echo and accepts the role of teaching others "progressive disclosure of goodbye." The echo's question "Why do you echo, Lira?" effectively tightens pressure at the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of salvaging "something pure from the wreckage" escalates through deepening discoveries (shrine windows, memory jellyfish, nested snow globe) with the glacier's closing creating time pressure. The cost is legible as Marrow loses the drowned passengers but gains transformative knowledge. Minor deduction as the middle shrine sequence could tighten its pressure mechanics slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on understanding hidden patterns with escalation through whisking moonlight→firefly synchronization→shadow path discovery, each deepening her connection to invisible forces. The cost of "constant vanishing" and trusting absence provides tension, but the philosophical quest lacks visceral opposition or risk of failure beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to systemic reckoning as Marisol discovers the diamond forces confrontation with collective lies, not just individual truth. The stillpoint's discovery through resonance ("hummed the Coalition's sign-off tone") shows earned progression. Cost manifests viscerally through "tasted copper and shame" and the final decay of preserved lies.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal excommunication to civilizational memory-loss as the prophet rises. The electromagnetic scream of dying knowledge creates urgency, forcing Elara to act. Her song spreading through frequencies and causing the prophet's followers to remember doubts represents meaningful deepening with visible cost—she remains alone while others reconnect.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving generational memory before it dissolves—intensifies when the child requests an impossible recording, forcing Posy to risk opening the sealed music box. This tightening forecloses her patient waiting and creates visible cost through the irreversible act of emptying all collected sounds. The resolution is earned through Posy's accumulated work, though the final transformation arrives slightly too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Central stake (protecting the Echo to prevent nightmares materializing) escalates through ice calving and shadow advancement, forcing the third-path solution. The "logically emotional calculus" creates genuine pressure, though the resolution's ease (shadows simply dissolve after listening) slightly undercuts the established threat level.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes build through accumulating observations toward the precise moment when "magnetic field would buckle trains, blackout relay towers." The seventh night's three-degree shift provides concrete escalation. Cost appears in Elian's sacrifice of his compass and transformation of impatience, though the revolution's broader stakes remain somewhat abstract beyond infrastructure disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from professional investigation to personal reckoning as Mara discovers her father's potential involvement, forcing her to confront inherited trauma. The cost is visible in her choice to expose the truth despite personal implications. However, the external conflict (dead commissioner's legacy) lacks immediate pressure since the antagonist is already deceased, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from repairing a music box to exposing judicial error, with Emil's choice forcing trade-off between institutional duty and moral action. The tightening occurs when Olya states "I can give it beat but I cannot give it mercy," forcing Emil to act beyond mechanical repair. Cost is visible in using chapel funds meant for illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from following coordinates to the Algorithm's urgent "Descend" command to the revelation about translation vs. ringing. The cost is visible when the arrow tip dulls and Juniper's ears ring with a frequency "no one else could yet detect." One meaningful deepening that reweights the quest's nature, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional duty through personal discovery to existential choice about memory itself. The firewall's bargain crystallizes cost clearly. One meaningful deepening when mother's presence reweights everything. Minor deduction for the AI's staged crash feeling slightly disconnected from the memory-keeper throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from seeing Sira in danger to the ice threatening to crush her, with meaningful tightening when "the weighted breath before reply tighten[s] into a noose of seconds." The two-futures vision effectively forecloses options. Cost is visible in physical toll and risk, though emotional cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes accumulate through pattern breaks: from watching to volunteering, from recording to listening, from keeping to giving. The dominant stake—learning to navigate endings—deepens when Mara chooses connection over documentation. Cost is visible in the surrendered heirloom, though the years-later frame diffuses immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accumulates through layered recognitions about the vines teaching acceptance, though escalation remains internal without external complication. The dominant stake—understanding why he stayed—tightens when he realizes Sarah knew "some loves could only express their true nature through struggle."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom before it dissipates—drives consistent pressure through the walker's methodical consecration. The escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. Cost is visible in his permanent commitment. Deduction for relatively static conflict without meaningful opposition or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal - from personal ritual to collective need, with the grandchildren's arrival providing meaningful escalation. The cost is felt in "pain not erased but folded into beauty sharp enough to cut fresh gratitude," though agency remains somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as each captured sound reveals the library's hidden consciousness, forcing Elara to choose between control and witness. The cost is legible when she renounces ownership of the crystal, though the single-beat escalation fits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of finding "the sound of growing older" coheres through accumulating discoveries, with the cassette tape providing the key deepening moment. Agency manifests through the prophet's deliberate marker system and choice to sit within the spiral, though the final cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: trembling floor → spinning clock hand accelerating → observatory exhaling → final collapse. The dominant stake (preserving versus releasing) tightens when Mira must choose between staying with her life's work or escaping. Cost is visible in the 30-year investment abandoned and the observatory's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of providing a "flawless goodbye" faces escalation through Calderon's confession "I never learned to end things clean" and deepens when Mara plays "the scent of hope" into sound. Cost is visible in the monitor flattening and Calderon's death. The piece relies more on accumulation than reversal, appropriate for its textural lens, though the single tightening moment limits higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go—escalates through Lyra's active choice to reverse the observatory's rings and engage the automaton. The tightening occurs when she must "walk the circumference of the twist until inside became outside," with clear cost in trading her own shadow. Some middle beats could show more immediate pressure rather than describing the process.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on epistemological crisis—how to reconcile error with authority—deepening through changeling's invitation to "set bones" of mistakes. The transformation from skeptic to teacher who embraces "bright fractures" shows meaningful cost. Escalation through accumulation rather than reversal fits the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of sharing light without fire escalates through the ritual's progression, with meaningful deepening when "the pearl's absence as fullness" reweights her relationship to darkness. Cost is visible in the pearl's dissolution and her acceptance of loss, though pressure could tighten more sharply mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from public exposure (53 million views) through private ritual to shared witness. The progression from first confession as "scream" to second as "seed" shows meaningful intensification. Cost is visible in the burial act and separation "no exchange of names, because in the protected vulnerability of new growth, labels are frost."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from external pressure (editor/landlord) to existential choice about artistic courage, with the vortex of "almost-voices" forcing Mara's decision. The cost is legible when she trades the collected hopes for courage, though the middle encounters could apply more pressure toward that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The seventeen-year wait establishes clear stakes that tighten through the one-hour bloom window and exact timing requirements for pollen release. Cost is visible in the vine's withering and Elara's physical sensation of centuries' weight. However, the resolution's ease ("dozens of voices remembering") undercuts the established difficulty of recovering lost knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from depleted starlight reserves through failed waiting to the realization that "relinquishment" is required. The pattern-making sequence raises tension as memory flares from discarded objects. Cost is visible in the physical endurance and the tearing of the treasured illustration plate, though the final consequence remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reversing time's theft—escalates through Ansel's discovery that the timer converts echo to torque, forcing him to choose between restoration and understanding. His decision to seal the device rather than exploit it shows meaningful agency with cost. Some middle sections lack immediate pressure as he studies patterns, though this fits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the valley from "folding in on itself"—escalates through the grotto's increasing resistance until the weaver must surrender her heaviest burden. The cost is visible (blood, confession), though the mystical threat remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered craft details toward Mara's acceptance that "memory can be both cage and key." The cost is visible in the jar collection of marriage "distilled to sawdust" and her planned second carving with "eyes open." However, the escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than decisive turns, appropriate for the lens but limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulated fragment-losses that make the ghost progressively more solid while depleting the narrator's substance. The final reversal (trading places through the blank frame) arrives with clear cost, though middle exchanges could tighten their individual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: sextant vibration → pump rerouting → beacon repair → crowd arrival. The meaningful deepening occurs when redirected flows become "redirected purpose." Cost is visible in the abandoned terminal's decay and the city's "exhausted optimism budget" forcing evacuation waves.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows the textural lens through deepening recognition: tiles whisper → rain pools → bear darkens → splits → seed revealed → planted.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes of understanding father's lies intensify through log discoveries to journal revelation, with meaningful deepening when coordinate leads to bunker. The cost lands in Mara's transformation from "legend seeker" to active dismantler. Minor deduction because the external pressure (Riga, canal journey) could more directly complicate Mara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preserving the storm-corn's planting method before it's lost forever. Pressure escalates through the harbormaster's arrival and attempted confiscation. However, the magical resolution (instant plant growth, convenient fog) somewhat deflates the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing—is signaled early and deepens through the weft thread's revelation as "extracted presence." The traveler's kneeling work of unwinding the thread creates meaningful escalation as faces emerge and she recognizes herself as her own first client. Cost is visible in the seven years of absence from ordinary life, though the resolution could press harder on immediate consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of reawakening beauty escalates through the assembly process, with each component (moonlight spectrum, raven feather, music-box pins) requiring greater sacrifice and risk. The ribbon's escape rather than staying provides meaningful reversal with clear cost—the palace's destruction—though the prince's agency in the final fall could be stronger. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as attempts compound toward the transformative release.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with her father's legacy—accumulates through textural layering rather than escalation. The piece deepens through memory (waiting at seven with a plastic helmet) to present action (grafting sand) to future promise (saplings), creating meaningful progression. However, the tension remains largely internal without external pressure forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (liberating trapped memories) signals early and deepens through each fountain revealing personal abandonment patterns. The third fountain forces Mara to confront her own perpetuation of the cycle. Final cost is legible as she releases control and speaks "not as a skeptic but as a daughter."

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from generational patterns of sacrifice—escalates through Kael's discovery of the beacon and his choice to transmit rather than root. Cost is visible when he feels "the crack destined for his own heart seal" and leaves the gear behind. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as patterns deepen toward the transformative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from personal summons to city-wide forgetting to cyclical renewal. The ghost's mentorship creates pressure that culminates in Elara's decisive action with the ribbon, though the conflict lacks sharp opposition—more meditation than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to maintain precise debt-measurement or transform the mechanism—tightens when the protagonist reads the incomplete "forgive" and must choose within "one heartbeat." The cost manifests physically (burning arms), socially (villagers' altered heartbeats), and materially (the reclaimed field emerging).

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the coin to uncovering family history to accepting an eternal role. The "chess clock set to infinite" crystallizes the cost, though middle beats lack opposition—Mercy proceeds without meaningful resistance. One strong deepening occurs when the cellar reveals her inherited duty.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear dominant stake: writing one future before dawn cracks the ice. Escalation through accumulating sacrifice (warmth→memories→name→body) with each loss narrowing options. The constraint-as-gift revelation deepens stakes effectively. Minor deduction as the middle section's predictive modeling visions feel slightly detached from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal preservation through clandestine resistance to city-wide transformation, with the solstice deadline creating genuine pressure. The deepening from copying silence to amplifying dust shows clear progression, though the inspectors' transformation arrives somewhat easily given the established oppression.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into art while confronting incomplete family history—deepens through Elena's graduated actions: positioning chair, wearing mask, scattering powder. The escalation follows the textural lens as density increases toward the final spiral-making, though the conflict remains primarily internal without significant external pressure or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether truth can survive institutional denial—escalates from private observation (cog meditation) through active archaeology (diving, mapping) to public confrontation. Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, with each discovered layer deepening Caldera's commitment. The closure choice to speak publicly after plague-long silence marks genuine escalation, though the immediate consequence remains suspended in the crowd's "hesitation."

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: seventeen syllables gathered, scale offered as sacrifice, city's heartbeat rearranging. The dominant stake (unlearning hatred) tightens through subtraction with visible cost at each stage, though the conflict lacks a decisive reversal or opposition that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes established immediately through the Ministry's prohibition against "unauthorized nostalgia." Pressure intensifies through the celestial timing constraint ("seven breaths away") and escalates as Marisol's rebellion spreads to others. The cost is legible when guards weep and bureaucrats laugh, showing irrevocable change to the social order.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from routine preservation through the riddle's challenge to the paradoxical demand to lie, with visible cost in "every coin in her apron leap out... newly etched with the silhouette of a bee." The tension between truthfulness and wonder-preservation forces the climactic choice. Minor issue: the boy's role lacks oppositional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the grammar of sentient architecture before it spreads—escalates from observation to ritual interaction to covenant-making. Mireille's agency drives the resolution through her deliberate displacement ritual (removing shoe, turning frame, folding paper boat), with visible cost in the embedded orris shard. The tension between the house's loneliness and potential spread creates authentic pressure, though a sharper moment of risk or trade-off could strengthen the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether to release memory that will dissolve comfortable certainties—"without breakage, the city would remain a museum of certainties, beautiful and extinct." The pressure deepens through accumulation as other statues awaken and ask "whether change hurt as fiercely as stasis." Cost is visible in the transformation but could be more viscerally felt. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate choice to crack the ampoule.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering a missed opportunity—escalates through pattern breaks (dice on edge, negative steps, blood marking) that narrow options toward the final choice. The cost manifests when Elara chooses dissolution over connection, the staircase "forgetting her" as the price of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: each glyph thickens air until "the greenhouse felt like the inside of a throat learning to speak."

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from individual disappearances to systemic art suppression, with Aurelia's lute transformation forcing artisans to choose between safety and heritage. The Council's arrival creates genuine pressure though their "bewildered" retreat rather than confrontation slightly reduces the cost's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake: escaping prophesied death at dawn. Escalation builds through failed yoyo tricks loosening bricks, the hunger stone growing heavier, to the final moment where time folds. The cost is explicit—losing his counterclockwise gift to gain freedom from fate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from physical resuscitation to psychological reconciliation as the narrator moves deeper into the funhouse. The dominant stake (confronting/tricking fear) tightens when the narrator must choose to give the clasp to the fear-child rather than keeping it. Cost is felt in the collapse of the defensive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: sketching resonance → reading cloud-lyre warning → layering sounds → collective drumming → spiral reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through pattern accumulation: silent watchers → tremor warning → altered whistle note → watchers stirring → city changing course → revelation. The dominant stake (understanding the watchers/gate) tightens when the cracked note finally provokes response. Cost is legible in the terrible knowledge the cartographer must now bear.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing historical lies versus preserving false comfort—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure tightens when the watchman appears, forcing Elara to choose between confrontation and escape.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes clearly signaled - documenting whether the pavilion can be saved while secretly preserving abandoned dreams. Escalation through deepening ritual (paper notes → direct inscription on stone) with meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional task to uncovering civilizational deception, with the blackout creating urgency and water rising as physical pressure. The tightening occurs when Mara discovers the catalogue's "honest origin was erasure itself," forcing her choice between compliance and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Grief's transformation drives escalation through accumulating density—from carrying "only a pocket of silence" to breathing the dream into glowing ribs to folding forty-nine cranes that become living lanterns.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through the geode's depletion—each fragment spent narrows future options while the protagonist races against the observatory's systems coming back online.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (Mara's need to resolve guilt over her brother's death) signals early and tightens through the driftwood's response and shell revelation, forcing her final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the moon-phase timing, the guards' fear-naming, and the rope ritual, each narrowing options toward forgiveness. The cost registers clearly in "pocket lighter without the pull, heart fuller," though the stakes could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake of navigating without traditional tools escalates through the compass sliding/cutting her, fog erasing poles, then dolphins arriving to offer new guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—recovering empathy through recovering pain—escalates effectively from reading coordinates to entering the lake to accepting collective suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on Kira's need for transformation/understanding, with one meaningful deepening as fireflies synchronize with the volcano's heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate meaningfully when Commander Voss's arrival forces Garnet to improvise, using misdirection rather than confrontation—a choice that narrows her options and demonstrates agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: placing rocks in sequence → star dust singing → rocks resonating → eels returning transformed. The dominant stake (understanding sacred patterns before the tide) tightens through each mathematical placement.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from academic tenure/exile through philosophical sparring to Caelus's physical vulnerability when removing his vocoder.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: private ritual → unexpected human connection → collaborative risk → confrontation with authority → sealed commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the tutor can return and speak his apology—tightens through the lace's transformation from unreadable pattern to map to worn banner.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure accumulates via findings (redshifted peaks), the live caterpillar, and the neutron-sample decay’s counterpoint, tightening the stance rather than driving a crisis. The meaningful turn is thematic—embracing non-dramatic causality—more than tactical; cost is a principled renunciation. Clear, coherent stakes, if gently scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—continue the pursuit or find meaning in the pause—is signaled early and tightens at the ash ring. The decision to wait, then renounce, is a credible, costly narrowing of options. External and internal threads interweave (smugglers’ camp vs. her conscience). Slightly soft external jeopardy keeps pressure more inward than mixed, but it remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure deepens as she moves from test pings to full “performance,” culminating in the battery dying and her acceptance. Escalation follows the lens: pattern intensifies, then cadence shifts (“played harder, faster,” then cut-off). The price is conceptual/emotional rather than catastrophic, but it’s felt. A single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (revive the distress signal/relieve accumulated dead) is signaled early and tightens when the re-set lens proves insufficient and demands sacrifice.

Pressure remains coherent and escalates to a resonant, costly stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stakes (survival and cultural continuity) are signaled early and tighten credibly: an exposed chime risks discovery, checkpoints increase, flour vanishes, and Lila’s death removes a living archive. Mara pays visible costs and alters tactics (ink on bread, sealing the chronicle in the bell). The convening declaration marks a stance crystallization, though the missing ending line blunts the culminating price/image. Escalation remains coherent and agency‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—alchemizing unused love before it rots the heart—tightens via the arrival of the man and the breath-synchronized ritual, leading to the door and orchard. The visible price is the relinquishing of the tear and the admission of withheld kindnesses. Escalation is accumulative: density and glow increase until the orchard forces a stance. Slightly low external opposition, but internal pressure remains coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes—losing the past versus surrendering the illusion of continuity—tighten as the garden intensifies and narrows her path to the mirror. The burn and the recognition of the fragment as a key force a renunciation choice with cost. Escalation remains coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the disintegration act. The price is emotionally felt and reshapes options thereafter.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and tight: protect and recover seeds without triggering premature collapse. Escalation is protagonist‑driven—the ghostly distraction, the waltz into netting, the timed dash. Tangible costs and a narrowing window keep pressure on, though she faces few true setbacks. The siren‑converging end preserves consequences beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early and escalates as she moves from hunting a sound to sacrificing her talisman and confronting complicity. The keeper’s demand forces a trade‑off; the forge encounter deepens pressure and knowledge. Agency drives the result and forecloses a prior path (hoarding absences). Stakes remain intimate but viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (altering memory at tangible cost) intensifies through a single decisive deepening: the ring’s coordinates reframe the request and force a trade‑off. The thief’s choice forecloses the “easy” transactional path, opting for reinterpretation over further theft. Price is felt but subtle; consequences are more moral/ontological than concrete, which trims the sense of jeopardy. Tension is steady, not jagged—appropriate for the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure builds via accumulative intensification: securing fuel, guarding against cuts, the building’s shudder, and finally deciding to leave the creation. Stakes are focused on whether she can construct a “safe zone” and at what personal cost. The decisive turn—abandoning possession—narrows options and carries an emotional price. Lack of an external antagonist keeps the curve quieter, but tension remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming a new identity via vulnerable truth—is signaled early and tightened by the heirs’ impending announcement and the arrival of guards. The key deepening is the shell’s instruction that reweights fear into tactic; escalation culminates in the risky projection choice. Visible price: exposure of raw fear and potential capture; he chooses endurance over flight. A slight remove remains because the leak occurs tomorrow, not on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (to make a navigable map of the dark) tightens as silences accumulate and the fort shrinks, culminating in the shadow-ink signature that forecloses the old world.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the timed onset of sound and the decision to engage the violin in this loop, culminating in a deeper realization. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-driven but does tighten via the countdown and the act of playing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust—tightens when she learns the prank’s intent, forcing a choice between exposure and communal absolution.

Tension remains steady and concentrates at the projector switch and the silent apology.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: today’s abysmal luck score tightens the thematic stake, and the garden’s counter-response deepens the conflict between measured chance and living knowledge. The apple and then the glove escalate meaning rather than danger. The price is acceptance and reprioritization, not pain; it fits the mode but limits peak tension. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—alter fate vs. accept identity—tightens as the lever’s activation summons interfering songs that reweight options. The moth‑bat ratio and “subdued awakenings” deepen pressure in line with the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her refusal and its consequences for selfhood and future possibilities. Escalation is quiet but decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain invisible/supporting or embrace disruptive, liminal music—intensifies through the descent and discovery. The meaningful tightening arrives with the hidden door and the choice to accept the ghost’s voice. Stakes remain primarily internal with limited palpable danger, so price feels conceptual rather than bodily or relational. Nevertheless, pressure coheres and grows to a credible stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—expel/weigh the truth to protect valley/self—tightens through “heavier” and the root piercing, forcing a sacrificial tactic (erasing the external leaves to surface the internal truth). The cost is legible (physical invasion, sorrow quantified, environmental hush as aftermath). Escalation is protagonist-driven under the accumulative lens, with one decisive intensification at 03:17. No cheap coincidence resolves the conflict; choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—quantifying the swallowed truth—tightens through decisive acts (decoding, opening, weighing). Agency escalates pressure: each bead increases cost until the final drop-out and burns. The moral calculus (testing faith vs. measuring guilt) sharpens at the peak; consequences persist in the haunting “beads” in the chest. No soft reset; options narrow credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on identity and duty versus the pull of erasure; escalation is a deepening rather than reversal. The tremor and the library’s living marginalia intensify texture, not direct opposition. The meaningful tightening is the recognition that the swan’s decay will foreclose her role. Pressure is coherent but remains mostly internal and lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens via the eclipse window and the faltering whistle, forcing Elara to risk and adapt in the moment. The alignment constraint creates a meaningful test; her decision to steady with the baby curl functions as the turn. Stakes remain intimate but clear, blending internal and external conflict. The price is subtle but legible in her expenditure and the ongoing “pebble” carried by the children.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes concentrate around recovering/reorienting memory and center; pressure tightens through the “Axis displaced” discovery and the mason’s “loose stone” insight. The decisive act—laying the tapestry face‑down and listening—narrows options and extracts a price (forfeit of the artifact and self‑repositioning). Escalation is subtle but purposeful under the accumulative lens. A touch more explicit friction or risk would lift the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (escape/transformation) is signaled early and tightens as the accidentally prophetic fortune reframes risk. The key turn is his renunciation via skiff, with a conceptual and practical price. Escalation is quiet but genuine, deepening through the fortune’s echo (“rock… inside you”). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (prevent possession) concentrate through one meaningful tightening: adding the congregation’s assumption as a hum that strengthens the threat. The “one loop left” beat compresses time and narrows options; choosing to record and then reverse his own doubt is a credible, costly tactic. The resolution flows from his agency and the woman’s counterstroke, not coincidence. Price and narrowing are clear without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming homesickness into a conducted symphony before collapse—is clear and tightens via the ticking clock (“fifteen minutes left”) and bodily failure. Escalation flows through movements that deepen pressure rather than adding new conflicts; her agency drives each intensification. Cost is legible: she spends stamina, sacrifices the shell, and accepts an earned stasis. Slight softness in explicit external opposition keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (self‑conquest) tightens through tangible tests: fracture choice, sideways rain cost, 17 arches, confrontation with the elder iteration. Agency drives escalation; the procedural path “hiccups,” forcing a riskier route, and the smash forecloses a power with consequence. The cost is legible and the trade‑off reweights options at the end. Slightly abstract stakes remain grounded by concrete prices on the body and world.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal but legible and escalate as she commits from idea to embodiment—repairing, risking the backward play, then fusing drum pulse with machine vibration. The meaningful tightening occurs as the disc nears its beginning/spent state, pressing a now‑or‑never resonance. The price (welcomed grief) is explicit and irreversible. It remains a quiet arc, but pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—integrity vs. institutional falsification—is established early and tightens when she’s tailed and confronted with the forged, future‑dated note. Her lateral choice and the shaft descent are meaningful escalations that narrow options and increase risk. The price is solitude and exposure to pursuit while disseminating uncensorable data. A direct external clash is avoided, but the pressure remains coherent and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes—can he grieve without shattering—tighten through deliberate, sensory choices that foreclose avoidance. The pivotal turn (offering the drop to the orchid) fuses internal and external conflict and exacts a price (he changes his livelihood path). Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens and deepens rather than reverses. The last breath’s “forgiveness” reads earned, not gratuitous.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transcend vs. endure) is signaled early and tightens when the collective arrives to ask “have you decided?”. The refusal forecloses a live path with felt cost. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens, moving from contemplation to a clear stance. A touch more external consequence or counter‑pressure on the refusal could intensify the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—redefining legacy through unfinished music—and tightens via a purposeful deepening rather than reversal. The decision to craft the resonator and sustain unresolved playing through the night demonstrates cost and commitment. Stakes remain intimate but consequential and are paid on the page. Slight softness in overt external jeopardy keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether she will surrender detachment for empathy. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the lens—the petal’s unfolding strata push her past observation into embodied consequence. Agency appears in both the initial acceptance (pressing the petal) and the final endurance (letting it hurt, not stopping him), with a visible cost. Stakes remain intimate but sharp; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on whether compassion remains anonymous yet enacted; the tightening comes with deciphering the address, choosing to deliver at night, legalizing the funds, and surrendering the locket. The price is concrete (relinquishing a personal relic) and thematically aligned. Tension is quiet rather than sharp, but the accumulative pressure builds credibly to a charged poise. A slightly tougher obstacle would have amplified cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on belonging; escalation is a steady deepening: from two walkers to a thirty‑seven‑person body, from searching to making offerings, to sprouts reflecting clasped hands. The key tightening arrives when Emil finds the tag and yields the reveal, forcing a communal over individual victory. The price is internal—a renunciation of isolation and acceptance of a binding role—credible at this scale though not overtly perilous. Coherence is intact under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the place/echo to complete her mother’s last word) tightens into a concrete trade: uncage echoes by paying future time. The aviary scene forces a non‑reversible choice with an explicit price, escalating from exploration to sacrifice. The nap’s countdown adds external pressure culminating in the giant’s exhale. Resolution grows directly from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reanimating the orchard as a proxy confrontation with ambiguous loss—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative turns (the click, the sighing shift, the opening stone, the symbol’s pulse). Agency drives each step, and the cost is credible: answers are foregone for restored motion and caretaking. Pressure rises via pattern density rather than overt impediments, which keeps tension quiet. One charged renunciation—sealing the astrolabe—provides the needed narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on audibility and visibility under a ticking outage; pressure coheres as he moves from secret caching to deliberate revelation. The meaningful tightening is the candle/girl discovery leading to the push of the final fragment. Cost is mostly identity exposure rather than a hard trade‑off, keeping tension quiet. Still, the escalation cadence is clear and purposeful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender of self—tightens continuously, with the key turn being her release of control under storm pressure. Physical escalation (veins syncing, pain like roots, rooting into the floor) clarifies price. The resolution is an earned renunciation that forecloses her human path. No antagonist is needed; the situational pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: find meaning worth trading in a world of scarcity. Pressure deepens through discoveries and the old woman’s mandate, culminating in the exchange and the choice to paint feverishly with what the water provides. The tightening is quiet yet real under the accumulative lens; a concrete price beyond the painting itself is light. The final sleep signals resolution earned by stance, not contest.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via deepening rather than reversal: surrendering observation/participation culminates in an irreversible transfer. Agency is present (he offers the memory, consents to exit acceptance, attempts to return the gift), though the seer drives the initiating move. The cost is clear and alters future options for both. Pressure remains coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can a fractured city be heartened—tightens through obtaining and assembling the missing parts, culminating in persuading the vigil-keeper. The mid‑story turn (gaining access to “Possible Music,” then learning the mouthpiece is with the woman) narrows options. The final breath is a chosen risk that forecloses the path of private, silent endurance. Prices (memory relic surrendered; public exposure) are felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silence vs. voiced life—tightens through a decisive deepening: from following arrows to self-punching confessions that visibly close paths behind him. The “speak or be spoken for” carriage crystallizes cost, and each confession alters the space and his options. Resolution emerges from his agency, not coincidence. Slightly emblematic scaffolding around the fortress image is neat but does not blunt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reasoned distance vs vulnerable participation—tightens as the tile forces sensation and she chooses to engage rather than refute. The shift from digit transcription to scoring an “unheard symphony” narrows options and forecloses the academic proof path. Cost is legible at the beach when she embraces unverifiable confirmation and literally washes the numbers away. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly; escalation is decisive without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake tightens once: Vey’s potential exile by mutiny is reconfigured into self‑exile through the door, with cost. The fragment’s compulsion and the storm’s clock apply coherent pressure. Vey’s bargain with the mutineers is a clear narrowing of options driven by agency. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential; one more beat of resistance from the crew could have further sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and tightens at the ink dip when the price is extracted. The breach sequence functions as the key deepening and narrows options; her sacrifice forecloses the path of keeping the lullaby. Resolution arises from Cassidy’s agency, with Rurik’s backlash underscoring lasting consequence. Stakes remain coherent and personal, avoiding inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing time’s texture without exhausting longing—tightens as the lamp’s hum rises and her writing turns from recording to dictating. The attempt to stop (micro-turn) sharpens price and agency before the glider act triggers irreversible change. Consequences persist in the reconfigured world and in her accepted burden.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (to exist legibly vs. erasure) tightens through the reel’s revelation and the press metaphor, forcing the choice to laminate and move into morning as a composite. Escalation is an intensification of density and cost consistent with the accumulative lens. External pressures (tide window, surveillance evidence) meaningfully compress options. The price is felt but remains conceptual/emotional rather than materially punitive, keeping this just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the riddle—tightens via the successive hums and the compass’s tug, forcing a trade‑off between proof and a living, ambiguous answer. The key deepening occurs at the “silence shaped like a spiral,” which changes knowledge and narrows options. Resolution is earned by Arlen’s renunciation and re‑stance rather than coincidence. The pressure is largely internal but unmistakable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the imminent privatization, tightening via the midnight decision to reconfigure the city rather than capitulate or scuttle. The reversal—the inspectors’ confusion—earns the postponement. Cost is legible but modest (a stayed execution rather than a wound), keeping the peak from absolute severity. A sharper on‑page sacrifice (lost income, broken alliance) would raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last bloom before sterilizing dawn—is clear early and tightens through the dual chemical countdowns. The gust and the pink bloom are the meaningful turn that forces commitment; her choice to wait and then shoot is a real trade‑off under time pressure. External extinction stakes interlock with internal hesitation. The cost is legible: she wins the image while losing the living subject forever.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused (seeds to the village; ship’s imminent departure) and escalate when the “fixed” drone jitters, forcing a new tactic. The retraining sequence converts theme into action under the deadline. Cost is chiefly temporal and cognitive, not a foreclosed path, but pressure tightens credibly. Resolution is earned by her adaptive choice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth’s emergence versus institutional capture—tightens as coincidence (radio) prompts a test but is resolved by her agency: speaking the key word, descending, then subverting the Registry via transmission and renunciation. The page tear and refusal to give coordinates foreclose paths with cost. Escalation is a single strong deepening consistent with the accumulative lens rather than multiple reversals. A touch more resistance at the language-key moment could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clear early (revive Viremont) and tighten with the resistant north ward that demands personal cost. The decisive deepening—offering his heartbeat, shattering the fork—earns the resolution without coincidence. Tension is more lyric than adversarial but remains coherent and rising under the chosen lens. The cost reweights the ending image rather than closing with a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates through one meaningful deepening: move deeper to the organ and expend the last personal anchor to prime it. The live clock (air pocket shrinking) and antagonistic hush/tendrils tighten options. Agency drives the turn; the solution is not luck but a high-cost, character-driven tactic. Consequences persist: the vial is gone and the temple’s state is permanently altered.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Silas will be swallowed by inherited silence or author his own story—tightens as he must keep speaking, confront the pipe’s memory, and choose forgiveness with boundary. The mirror/pipe beat is the meaningful deepening; the “I forgive… but will not become it” is the turn that reweights options. External and internal pressures interweave well, though the price remains more metaphysical than concrete. Resolution grows credibly from his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (save the boy/lineage) tightens at the altar, then forces a higher‑cost choice on the river. Agency is decisive: she intervenes; he chooses the cold hand and the ice. The price is unmistakable—her dissolution, his near‑drowning, and the orchard’s loss. Escalation is clean and singularly focused without cheap coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear (restore what was unmade), and pressure coheres via a deepening cadence: loom discovery → memory‑release stitches → blood sacrifice → bridge and tide return. The cost is present but inward and ceremonial rather than contested; escalation reads as density increase more than obstruction. The decisive act (pricking his palm, final line) narrows options and pays off. Tension is felt even without an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are focused (restore faith/prayer house) with one meaningful tightening: the reliquary hum and root‑road catalyze the dawn choice that can’t be retaken. The price is a life reoriented to this place. Tension is more devotional than perilous, but pressure coheres and gathers toward the sunrise act.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truthful self vs protective anonymity—is signaled early and tightens credibly with the drone’s early arrival. The external clock and internal conflict interweave, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses a path. Visible prices: she keeps the confession, mails anonymity, erases codes that might reveal her center. Tension escalates at sentence and beat levels without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: avert the coup and protect cultural memory. Escalation is clean: secret work → reveal → direct threat (pistol) → counter‑move via synchronized breathing and alternative routes “blooming.” The cost is risk and exposure; options narrow plausibly. A sharper on‑page price could push higher, but the tightening reads earned under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is announced and tightens: finding and speaking within the “space before deciding.” The corridor opening is a clear deepening that narrows options to a single charged act. Cost is legible (emptying letters, a wound that needed healing, relinquishing the long-held silence). A small lack of on-page resistance keeps it just shy of maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around the imperative to decode before loss; the page-by-page reveals escalate emotional cost. The boy’s line “stay” tests commitment and forecloses departure, paying a price in endurance and confession. Stakes remain intimate but consequential, integrating internal guilt with the external smearing clock. The resolution arises from agency—naming, staying, and inscribing the third line.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (recover/“develop” joy) is signaled early and tightened when the Lattice demands a living wall, forcing a concrete, risky action. The painting sequence exacts a cost (“each brushstroke cost her a sigh”) and forecloses retreat by binding the fragment permanently to the wall. Escalation is protagonist‑driven throughout; no coincidences resolve the core problem. Quiet but unmistakable deepening culminates in the shard’s sacrifice and her over‑exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens when her method fails and the coin demands a trade; the nested city revelations deepen stakes. The decisive turn is Liora’s acceptance of uncertainty, foreclosing the comfort of completion. The cost is conceptual but legible on the page. A small additional external consequence could have further sharpened the knife.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—plant the glyphs before surveillance captures them—is clear and tightens with Voss’s arrival and the imminent satellite pass. Arlo’s agency drives the turn via passphrase and pollen gambit; the warp residue escape is a paid‑for option, not luck. Costs are present (risk, used seed, time compression), though not devastating. Tension runs sentence‑to‑sentence without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (transmuting centuries of pain into beauty/rest) tightens through recognition of the lullaby, the postscript’s directive, and the choice to plant/seal the card. The cost—surrendering his insomnia’s purpose to the shell—is legible. Escalation is driven by his agency rather than coincidence. Pressure remains coherent without a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—save the names before total dark—tightens through the chandelier’s demand and the dwindling bulbs. Each surrendered memory is a clear price that narrows Lira’s options to the final irreversible trade. The cracked tube’s partial success and the chandelier’s escalating hunger create a clean deepening. Resolution is decisively driven by Lira’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (resurrection vs. weaponization of language; moral compass vs. council) is early and coherent. Escalation is the progression through promises, with the third and the “final voice” requirement tightening options decisively. Resolution stems from Elara’s agency with an unmistakable price. The pressure is lyric rather than adversarial but remains taut.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are tight from the outset (seal vs. irrigation) and escalate with the Gardener’s threat, then deepen via the collaborative solution under a dawn deadline. The meaningful narrowing comes with the calibrated 70/30 compromise and syncing to the volcano’s breath. The price is emotional/political rather than bodily, but it’s present and alters future options. A sharper on‑page repercussion from either faction would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—evade capture while re‑authoring memory—tightens through alliance, public dissemination, and the raid. The meaningful deepening is the decision to risk exposure by sending music into the city; cost is the necessary disappearance. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and culminates without requiring a set‑piece reversal. External conflict remains largely off‑stage, but internal/external braid well.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the threshold/father’s design—tightens through the decoding beat and culminates in a deliberate step off the terrace, narrowing options. Escalation is quiet but present, with the spiral discovery functioning as a meaningful deepening. The price is accepting temporal/relational loss to enter the “between-heartbeats” maze. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—complete the rite before sunrise/auto‑ascent—tightens once and guides choices (climb, exhale, forgo data, board just in time). Escalation is protagonist‑driven through ritual acts that deepen meaning rather than reversals. The visible price is conceptual (renunciation, inheritance) more than peril, but it’s legible and charged. A single sharper pinch from the ticking clock could heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes focus on whether her sacrifice yields meaning and whether she can act before memory dissolves. Escalation is a deepening, not a reversal: fragments → personal revelation → planted legacy → affirmed worth. The price is concrete (self‑amnesia) and felt at closure. Slight limitation: opposition is largely internal/time‑bound, keeping tension more contemplative than combative.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are modest but coherent: can Cass fracture monotony through engineered chance without being seen. Pressure deepens via synchronized performers and the live clock of tide and “between acts.” The boy’s win provides the turn; Cass’s renunciation is the price that tightens the thematic stake. Low overt opposition keeps the ceiling below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming memory/identity under a ban) tightens through the dwindling dust and the sunrise deadline. The “final verse demanded sacrifice” is the key escalation, narrowing options and making cost explicit. Resolution is earned by agency: she completes the stanza at her pulse and accepts the reconfigured self. Tension remains coherent without an antagonist, interweaving internal and external pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—complete the reckonings before sunrise—tightens via the prism’s flare and the imminent “audit” of daylight. The final choice (hurling the prism, accepting its loss) reads as earned escalation under the accumulative lens. Pressure is quiet rather than adversarial; the lack of significant resistance slightly lowers intensity. Still, the cadence shift to action at the end delivers a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (translating guilt into a language that won’t burn) intensifies through decisive beats: ingesting ash, voicing the unsaid, transforming ash to ink, choosing public witness. The tightening forecloses a path (silent endurance) and embraces a cost (visible vulnerability and unreturned innocence). The pressure remains coherent under the textural lens. No reliance on coincidence for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates texturally: from preparation to a live test balloon to a reality‑wide release, culminating in a conceptual turn. Stakes (revitalizing consensus reality) are large but localized through her acts; the tightening moment is pricking blood and speaking the equation. The price is primarily acceptance of uncertainty and dispersal of control, not a hard foreclosure of options. A touch more friction or risk on the page would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—confronting/decoding the building’s memory—intensifies as the lineage tie raises the price. The tunnel sequence is a decisive deepening that narrows options, culminating in transformation. Cost is unmistakable (self erased into architecture). Slight inevitability at the pull softens, but does not erase, earned escalation via her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset; escalation arrives when mirrors refuse and force an internal pivot (“convince them she could change”). Her decision to dance and become mirror narrows options and carries a renunciation cost. Pressure tightens under the hush/bell clock. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential; no luck shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—ending the war through a fragile treaty—is coherent and sharpened by the ritualized reading of the dead. The meaningful tightening arrives when she reveals her method and signs despite acknowledged imperfection; the price is to live with and enforce a compromise. No flashy reversals, but pressure deepens credibly under the lyric lens. The cost is legible and persists beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (release/preservation) and tightens as the storm nears and the music box winds down. Agency drives escalation: he follows the crack‑map, digs, winds, and places the egg, with the price (permanent drought, moral cost) explicit. The cadence shift at the box’s slowing and the ghosts dissolving reads as a meaningful deepening. Stakes remain intimate but consequential; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the intricate untying/locking sequence that literally changes the city’s state. The crucial choice—declining the weaver’s passage—forecloses an easy path and leaves a felt price on the page. Internal and external pressures interweave (contract vs. awakening city); tension persists into the “terrifying lullaby” of freedom. A single explicit beat of risk or near‑failure during the weaving could intensify escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to tell ethically—tightens as the stick burns down and forces reversal of reversal. The burn-to-fingers beat is a concrete pressure point that narrows options to a stance. Internal and external threads interweave (career pressure vs. ritual insight) with consequences implied beyond the page. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (make the ephemeral visible before it vanishes) tightens through the butterfly’s arrival and the gathering swarm testing each knot. The escalation is a clear deepening: her work is claimed and lifted, forcing a real surrender. The price is emotional rather than tactical, but it’s legible and earned in the final beats. Minor softness: the conflict never sharpens into a hard dilemma beyond release.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes—preserve names before the glacier erases them—are clear early and deepen through the ritual’s procedural tension. The key tightening is the rope remembering and the circuit closing, leading to the aurora’s flare and voices. Costs are internal (relinquished guilt, dissolving relic) yet legible. While pressure is quiet, the accumulative escalation is precise and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes concentrate on whether she will enforce continuity or let it evolve—tightening when the seal fuses, the question appears in vines, and the lens breaks. Agency drives escalation: she rewrites the directive, helps the bunker “undress,” and consents to transcendence. The cost—selfhood yielding to process—is legible on the page. Lack of an overt antagonist lowers intensity slightly but suits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save a cosmology vs. the conqueror’s erasure—is signaled early and tightens as night runs out. Escalation occurs through deliberate acts (schematic, door, covenant) culminating in a vow that forecloses public knowledge. The price is the protagonist’s isolation and refusal of power. Tension is mostly inward but coheres with the external clock of dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure meaningfully tightens when shadow‑Lira appears and the pin snaps further, forcing Lira to pay a price by taking in the pain she condemned. The dominant stake—convincing war‑ghosts via non‑force—converges with her internal reckoning. Resolution grows from her choice and forecloses the easier path of unilateral fixing. Stakes stay intimate but feel consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is established early and tightens when the device hums and the dream “speaks,” forcing a value trade: form vs freedom. The dismantling forecloses a live option with clear cost to his identity and craft. Pressure is mostly internal but coherent; the cadence shift at the hum/vision beat functions as escalation. A touch more external friction would have heightened cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (revive orchard/withhold forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens through discoveries (fig-scroll vows) and ritual risk. The key turn is an active refusal—barring elders despite amended contracts—showing cost and stance crystallization. Pressure is more devotional than combative, but escalation reads as deepening under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper external push would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are signaled early (catalog vs. contamination/grafting) and tighten when Quell warns of being “pruned into every tree.” Lira’s refusal and active burning of Quell‑tagged memories constitute a decisive trade‑off with cost (relinquishing power and lineage, destroying a mentor’s legacy). Escalation is primarily internal but coheres with the world’s rules and culminates in visible action. The clipped final sentence slightly dissipates the after‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes concentrate on access and extraction under a living, language-based pressure; the main tightening occurs at the cipher that demands a price, followed by the collapsing footnotes escape. Agency drives turns—Elara opts for the year trade and the theft of absences. The immediate repayment slightly reduces lasting consequence, but the mission’s ongoing nature preserves cost. Pressure coheres and deepens rather than multiplying reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding/understanding the garden—tightens through the midway and carousel, culminating in a stance shift at EXIT. Pressure accrues via accumulating “threads” and the cost of identity fracture. Escalation is inward but legible; the carousel beat is a meaningful deepening. A touch more resistance or a foreclosed alternative on the page would raise the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on translating confusion into clarity to restore/contain memory without re‑weaponization. Escalation is accumulative: seal → mechanism waking → hovering threads with stored absences → weaving/merging → reconfigured seal and time’s altered resumption. The pressure is more ceremonial than adversarial, with little resistance, but the cadence tightens credibly toward the authorization act. The price is chiefly conceptual, yet it effectively reweights options at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (survive and carry the last map through a timed hush) is clear early and tightens at the Warden and the Great Resonance Dome. The final escalation is protagonist-driven: completing the circle and severing sound pathways with visible risk. Prices are present (time window, risk of attracting beings, cracking the stone), though a sharper on‑page internal trade‑off would have pushed tension even higher. No coincidences resolve the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens with the discovery of the missing shard and the desert’s imposed hush. The hush creates a decisive pressure beat that narrows options and marks cost. Escalation is primarily accumulative rather than antagonistic, but the retrieval-and-return cadence is effective. A sharper in‑scene trade‑off or failure before success would further heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are coherent (pattern collective memory before it dissolves), with time pressure from the storm and solid fog. Escalation reads as density: from measuring shards to leaving tribute to making a spiral map, culminating in the signature. The cost is letting go—releasing memories, losing the banner’s color, accepting self-erasure in footprints. The pressure is lyrical rather than oppositional, but it tightens sufficiently under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent and early (break the hush’s gravity), and escalation is a clear density increase—stair to sphere to skywide mosaic. Agency drives each turn (lighting from reversed droplet, obeying “Catch,” stepping into the sphere). The price is mostly internal and symbolic (chain snap, rag to ash), credible for an accumulative design but slightly soft on concrete foreclosed options. One more sharpened cost or risk test at the summit could elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation) is signaled early and tightens via the daughter’s arrival, the silent co-watching, and the offering of the cicada. The meaningful turn is the daughter accepting the object and the mother’s low-voiced metaphor, which narrows options from avoidance to tentative engagement. Cost is legible: risk of exposure, relinquishing argument posture, and time spent in endurance. Pressure is subtle but consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    One dominant stake—can she expand beyond confinement—drives escalation. Tightenings arrive via methodical tests: controlled advance, sweetened second silence, the memory trade, the membrane, and the climactic refusal. Visible/felt prices (memory for cutting, relinquishing the doll, forfeiting the ultimate silence) sharpen the final choice. Pressure remains coherent to the hour’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—maintaining/teaching silence—tightens when the dial spikes to 30 and the vial clears, forcing the confession. Nilo’s choice to slow the gondola and the rider’s choice to speak narrow options with a felt price. The escalation is subtle but legible under the accumulative lens. Consequence lands in the gondola’s steadiness and the sealed fear.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (reach the stair and claim/renounce power by sunrise) is clear, but escalation is smooth and largely unopposed. The meaningful tightening is the waterfall pattern shifting and the door’s biometric/quantum lock. No reversal or trade-off tests her stance; the final acceptance carries limited visible price. Tension is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: coaxing a suffocating soul across while confronting her own mirrored wound. The escalation is a deepening rather than reversal—hand contact → drowning memory → scars linked → threshold heat. The cost is her chosen endurance and continued isolation. Tension is steady, if more ritual‑solemn than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting predatory debt/shame into liberation—tightens through the messages, pressure spike, bolt twist, and the choice to discard value. Agency drives escalations; no coincidence resolves the core knot. Costs are legible and alter options (loss of bolt/diamond; rejecting further unpaid work). Stakes remain intimate yet consequential (multiversal interest rate), fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are legible early (truth vs. legacy), and pressure tightens with the warm handle, Muse’s implicit challenge, and the physical cost when the handle snaps. The decisive act—speaking the confession aloud—forecloses the path of secrecy. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively without requiring an antagonist. The price is unmistakable on the page (blood, loss of name, public shift).

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reconfiguring failure into possibility—tightens with each deepening (allegiance, script of unlived choices, fusion with puppet). The names‑as‑constellations beat makes the price palpable before acceptance of the seed, and agency drives turns. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses his prior withdrawal. Only the truncated last line slightly blunts peak tension’s release.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can a small, careful action redeem waste and re-route a life. Pressure tightens from noticing an anomalous object to risking institutional action (new folder, provenance entry, embedding the button in a child’s record). The cost is accepting uncertainty and future accountability; no antagonist is needed under the accumulative lens. A slightly greater on-page consequence or pushback could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early: reclaim erased histories under active surveillance. Escalation tightens through concrete beats (reappearance of drones, sprint, threading/azimuth adjustments, citywide patch-in) and culminates in a visible price (exposure, surrender posture). Agency drives turns; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. One more on-page hazard or trade-off inside the booth could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: prevent the prophecy from locking in his death. Escalation tightens as the hush “pushes harder,” the atrium flares, spectral voices name futures, and he counters with increasingly precise tactics. The peak choice—the backward-traveling erasure note—narrows options and exacts a cost. Pressure remains coherent and internally motivated; no convenient outs.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decode before drift) is clear; escalation arrives via the rising arbor, the gust, and the keyleaf completing twelve. Agency drives resolution (prodding, weighting, assembling, naming), and coincidence only complicates. The price—time pressure and physical risk—is felt but gentle; there’s little foreclosed alternative beyond failure. Still, the cadence tightens and resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control vs uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens at the pool: dropping the compass forces a cold, risky retrieval and then a harder renunciation. The watch alignment is a meaningful deepening that reweights options; the shop‑locking cements the price. Pressure is mostly internal; absence of an antagonistic force slightly softens escalation. Still, the tradeoffs and the irreversible leave‑behind read as paid.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (redeem/name/letting go) tightens through the material’s resistance (coin’s sigil won’t melt), the mirror’s accusation, and the kintsugi repair, forcing a costly release. The meaningful turn is the silver mirror crack and Alder’s choice to trace breaks with gold, then surrender the rolled plate to the river. Price is legible: he forecloses the path of hoarding or resurrecting her and accepts a communal, irreversible dispersal. Tension rides on internal conflict rather than an external antagonist yet remains palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim the child’s splintered laughter) tightens through the harp gambit and the giggle’s near-escape. Escalation is modest but coherent; Elara’s agency catalyzes the pause and capture, and the price (losing the tooth, breaking the string) is on page. The tension is lyrical rather than adversarial, yet it deepens meaningfully at the boulder/harp beat. The resolution is earned by her chosen method, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake escalates through spikes, equations, and the asymptote choice; the strap-tearing is a meaningful narrowing with felt loss. Internal and environmental pressures interweave, and cadence tightens toward the offering. The conflict remains primarily internal and abstract, slightly softening urgency. Still, the cost and renunciation are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—honoring histories by returning what was taken—tightens decisively upon recognizing the boy‑self and stepping through. The protagonist’s agency determines outcome; the price is explicit: loss of the fragment and a relinquished role. Tension scales via the painting’s tilt and the consequent identity re‑frame at the end. The conflict remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake (freeing/containing time and ghosts) with one decisive tightening at the unwinding choice. The building’s “bargain” and the ghosts’ needs complicate her aim without undercutting agency. Costs are more conceptual than visceral, and opposition is gentle, keeping tension elegant but not maximal. Still, the final choice narrows options credibly (half‑recoil; carry the mainspring).

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are coherent: to awaken/compress eternity at the cost of destabilizing a perfect system. Escalation is earned by Corwin’s agency (printing the sentence, releasing the whisper) and the immediate unraveling. The cost is legible across concrete losses (keeper’s dissolution, system collapse) and the risked step into negotiable air. Minor softness: external opposition is low, so tension derives mainly from execution and consequence rather than contested resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on whether meaning can be made against empire/guilds under a predatory storm; escalation tightens from argument to forbidden exposure to an irreversible inscription. Agency drives the turn (Aurelio writes on the glass), with visible risk and a reweighted future as price. The antagonism is atmospheric/institutional rather than embodied, which slightly softens visceral tension. Still, the storm pause and fissuring mirror provide a decisive pressure crest.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clean and present early; the tightening arrives with the honesty tether requirement. Internal conflict (city vs daughter) sharpens the peak choice, and price is paid in vulnerability and giving up the chip. Escalation is lyrical but steady; a hair more friction or reversal could intensify pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering the place where explanations fail—tightens into a concrete price when the lagoon requires tribute. Escalation is clear: curiosity → compulsion → vision → demand → renunciation, with each step narrowing options. The cost is unmistakable (her collection and autonomy reconfigured as she becomes the hinge). Internal and external pressures interlock without coincidence resolving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are coherent (whether to accept the slide’s call and recode her navigation), with a meaningful tightening as projections thicken and her pulse is recruited to the “gears.” Agency drives the turn: she commits to the carving method and later refuses the GPS, foreclosing a path. Cost is understated but present as surrender of technological assurance for a mythic, relational ledger. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but cadence shifts are decisive under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is interior and coheres: the quest shifts from capturing dawn to letting night pass through—intensifying when the moonflowers finally uncoil above freezing. The painting choice (indigo negatives by day/glow by night) is a clear deepening and carries cost in solitude and endurance. Escalation is quiet but purposeful; the decisive reweighting lands at the vines’ opening. The truncated last line mutes the final squeeze but doesn’t erase the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. personal/future cost) tightens credibly as each exchange narrows her path. The mother’s betrayal page amplifies the moral calculus and forces stance crystallization. The broadcast choice is agentive and irreversible, with legible costs signaled (possible “crucifixion,” foreclosed futures). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revival by rejecting false comfort—tightens through purposeful acts culminating in smashing the bottle. The price is legible: relinquishing the last relic of “answers” for uncertain, communal work. The lanterns’ shift and first exile’s arrival read as earned escalation rather than coincidence. Slight softness in external opposition keeps it shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes center on whether to suppress or engage the prophecy and what cost it exacts on Ambrose and the city. Pressure tightens with the living waveform, the immersion choice, and the reversal via the memory loop that forecloses simple erasure. The price is explicit: Ambrose becomes the city’s foghorn; the orchard’s transmutation erases his sanctuary. Escalation reads as a decisive deepening consistent with the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: coax the vortex into memory of an oak to reopen inheritance without unleashing chaos. Escalation is a purposeful tightening: she pays with breath/heat, then seeds, then steadiness as the atrium groans and the oak cracks stone. The earned stasis—choosing to remain—forecloses the tempting path. Stakes skew conceptual but translate into tangible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is whether to honor protocol or listen differently; escalation arrives via mounting anomalies and the rope’s “tug” demanding the bell. The decisive tightening is her rerouting of the timer and pressing the switch, foreclosing the siren path at zero hour. The price is reputational and ethical more than physical, but it’s legible and tied to her vocation. Tension scales appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal—can he meet cosmic fragility with care—and escalate through a density/tone shift: reflections linger → glow blooms → fleck vision → question of bravery/change. The meaningful tightening arrives with the meteor’s question and his choice to relinquish the lantern and role, a visible cost. Pressure is coherent and grows under the accumulative lens, though opposition is largely existential rather than situational. The final acts (leaving the dome open, walking away) feel earned and definitive.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve or release unspoken words) is set early; escalation arrives via the child’s transfer and the hairline fracture/dream. The choice forecloses a path and exacts a price (vow broken, long-term endurance pledged). Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens without needing multiple reversals. Quiet but unmistakable tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (redefining time’s texture) tightens via the move from observation to embodied test to social exchange. The urn fragment trade is a credible price with felt loss, and the noon experiment deepens knowledge. Pressure is measured and interior; no sharp reversal, but the escalation suits the accumulative lens. A slightly firmer final beat would heighten the cost’s afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal/artistic—whether he can find a stance toward damage—and escalation arrives via the woman’s discordant instrument and his choice to alter it (tuning the buzz to a sigh). The tightening is modest but clear: from solitary tending to a collaborative weave that risks altering the brokenness he cherishes. Costs are small but legible (sleeve, surrendering feather/words). Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, though the conflict never sharpens into a hard binary.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (complete the bridge before death) tightens via expanding circuitry and the animals’ participatory risks (rat chews insulation; cat interrupts a node). The decisive deepening is Mateo integrating himself into the system, paying a plausible price. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial but remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (truth about the visitors’ harvest) are signaled early and deepen through evidence gathering to a reframed threat. Escalation is primarily intellectual and tonal rather than confrontational, but it tightens toward the convergence scene. The visible price is limited to reputational risk and the ominous “last free choice,” leaving consequences largely after the scene. Still, agency drives the turns and the end stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief/war into growth) tightens through tern warnings, dwindling time, and the reef’s conditional acceptance. Escalation reads as density and cadence shift rather than reversals; the moment of phosphorescent emergence and the shoot’s break crystallize commitment. The cost is felt mainly internally with modest external resistance. Strong, if quiet, pressure for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and sustained: find the brother/collapse distance. Escalation is steady—decoding to pursuit to excavation—though resistance is light and solutions tend to work on first try. Agency drives turns (using the leaf to alter the cylinder, choosing to set out at dawn). The visible prices are modest, keeping tension strong but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—communion with the lost mother vs. ongoing stasis in grief—tightens as the impossible phenomena escalate. The decisive act (taking her hand) forecloses return and exacts a felt price, reweighting options. Pressure is coherent and deepens under an accumulative/textural lens. The only minor softness is that external jeopardy is low, though internal cost carries the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—amending reality/identity through wonder—tightens via the chess match and the decisive invitation to step onto a paradoxical stair. Escalation is driven by her agency (queen sacrifice, secret bishop, invitation), and the cost is visible (collapse, relinquished hour, passing the tool). Tension operates more through lyric charge than jeopardy, but pressure coheres and deepens to the peak choice. No luck resolution; turns arise from prepared tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—memory vs erasure under an interregnum—is signaled early and tightened by Kestrel’s entrance and the rifle-to-pawn square gesture. Escalation is quiet but decisive: they repurpose conflict into a charged pact, foreclosing violence for testimony. The visible price is restraint and exposure until dawn; the move to carry the board widens future risk. Slight softness: danger remains atmospheric rather than materially sprung.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to restore dangerous belonging—tightens into the decision to inscribe truth on her own skin. The cost is explicit: protective mercury cracks; substitutes shatter; the stone is spent. Escalation is protagonist‑driven and coherent under the accumulative lens. The external antagonist is minimal, but internal pressure suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (self‑forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens through decoding to embodied trial in the maze. Escalation is internal but legible, culminating in a decisive gesture with conceptual cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without relying on coincidence. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, trimming peak intensity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stakes (making the spire sing before the ritual to reweight blame) are clear and escalate via density and pattern break when she stops speaking to listen. The decisive tightening is her acceptance of cost, which redirects her path away from the priests and toward a blood-painted reckoning. The cost is felt, though its most concrete payment is deferred to the implied painting. Internal and external pressures interweave without coincidence resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—meaning versus survival—is signaled early and tightens via the clock and chain attrition. The key turn is protagonist‑driven and forecloses the survival path with visible cost. Internal fear and ethical calculus (mercy vs meaning) interweave with the external pressure. The resolution is earned and does not rely on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—how to salvage the quay’s meaning—tightens from failed mirror to hidden preservation, foreclosing return. Escalation is an accumulative deepening: discovery → copy under dwindling light → self‑recognition in the shell → transference. The price is clear in renunciation (keys left, sale of mirror, night bus). The pressure is interior but coherent; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible, with one meaningful tightening: from internal vow to an external test (the boat’s course shift). Pressure deepens via ritual specificity rather than reversals, consistent with the chosen lens. Cost is implicit endurance and relinquishment of louder, easier tactics. A touch more external resistance could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reversing loss—tightens via timed calls, the spiral build, and the realization she must be the offering. Each instruction narrows options, culminating in stepping into the center to “let the spiral close.” The felt price is unmistakable as identity unthreads to achieve the aim. Minor note: no antagonist, but pressure remains coherent and internal/external strands interlock.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—safety versus corrosive truth—is signaled early and deepens under storm pressure. The key tightening is her refusal to cast the eye downriver (foreclosing an easy out) and the risky redefinition of the problem by planting it. Costs are visible: enforced confession, surrendered secrecy, acceptance of a borderland life. The escalation is organic, not plot‑convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the light/self from a cycle of borrowed memory—intensifies as anomalies compound. The apparition reframes risk, and the release of the Edelweiss forecloses a path with a visible price (loss of personal memories). Pressure coheres under the taught lens of “gaps,” tightening options. The belated horn and returning gulls serve as earned consequence, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to step into an alternate life or revalue the present—tightens via the chip warming, the doorway humming, and the flood. The meaningful deepening is the realization that the true choice is “whether to step at all,” which narrows options. The price is relinquishment of fantasized lives and a life lived with the knowledge of chosen solitude. Resolution comes from his agency at the lock and subsequent refusal to re‑lock his own shop door.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (erase self to mend sky/restore name) is signaled early and tightens as memory literally drains away. The shard’s revelation meaningfully deepens the conflict and narrows options to a binary: descend and doom, or accept erasure. The final act is unambiguously a paid price. Slight softness: resistance at the peak is brief, making the final trade feel a touch inevitable rather than hard-fought.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to hold presence without killing it) tightens from confession to an irreversible choice; the act forecloses his prior commercial path. Emotional and ethical calculus (memory as commodity vs. shared moment) informs the climax. The price is felt but mostly conceptual and relational; external consequences remain gestural. Still, escalation is coherent and earned under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—impose narrative order or accept cyclical time—tightens through the scroll’s instructions, the grave vision, and the footprints. The culminating choice to let snow erase her words forecloses a path (tidy ending) with felt cost. Internal and external pressures braid (dreams pawing at windows; mandate “do not land”). The escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal (recover meaning vs. live hollow), and pressure coheres through a deepening focus on the screw and the clock’s breath. The meaningful turn arrives when absence becomes aroma, reweighting the object and compelling the reassembly choice. Cost is acceptance of loss rather than cure, with a quiet but definite foreclosure. Escalation is subtle but present; the prop inconsistency blurs the late tactical choice a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (can she transform grief without repeating the lethal error?) tightens via the live clock of the kettle’s plume and held breath. The eleventh-to-twelfth stroke sequence escalates coherently, with pain and superstition narrowing options. Resolution is earned by her completing the spiral and then speaking the name into the storm, paying emotional and physical prices. The typhoon complicates rather than resolves, amplifying the achieved release.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering a real apology without re‑exploitation—is tightened by the imperfect miracle’s costs and the ticking orchard. Escalation is agency‑driven: uncorking the bottle, risking the forbidden pen, and placing the bottle as offering narrow options. The confession’s playback/erasure creates price and consequence, culminating in her choice not to publish. Pressure coheres to the final renunciation with no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: achieve unification/understanding before the hiccup’s exhale. Escalation reads as density/deepening—pages rearranging, rules sung, name erasure, increasing gravitational pull—ending in a costly renunciation. Agency is present in the method choice (walking inward while walking out) and the decisive act (placing the dictionary, surrendering memories). The stakes remain primarily internal but are made concrete through charged objects and spatial tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (meaning of time vs. duty/self) tightens from observational unease to an irreversible decision. The uphill flow and traced origin escalate pressure toward the counterclockwise turn, which forecloses the prior identity. Cost is conceptual but felt; no antagonist needed. Some tension is told rather than dramatized, softening the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (grief/identity/closure) is signaled early and tightened when two Lucs appear. Maya’s agency escalates pressure via the laser‑mapped path and the final merge attempt; the option to “swap” is foreclosed by data showing identical quantum signatures. The cost—surrendering certainty about who returns—reads in the fused man’s “stranger’s caution.” Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to chase the ghost of compulsion or widen responsibly—tightens with the wet-ink instruction and culminates in burning the lantern and leaving it behind. The price is visible (abandoning the scavenger hunt/talisman) and the options are narrowed by her choice. Tension interweaves internal and external pressures without requiring an antagonist. Slightly soft on explicit consequence beyond the charged image, but the cost reads.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (estrangement vs. connection/beginning) tightens through the wrong‑number ritual into the gate confrontation and final forfeiture. The meaningful turn is the refusal at the gate, deepened by the later, costlier cut of the wires. The emergency call as first “real” test sharpens price and forces stance. Pressure remains coherent without reliance on coincidence to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory before erasure—is signaled early and tightens via external clock and security interruption. The meaningful turn is her decision to include the locket, paying a personal price to deepen the covenant. External and internal conflicts interweave (public record vs. private keepsake). The cost is unmistakable and carries forward into the home scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—relief from loneliness through reciprocity—is clear early, and pressure tightens when the boy appears with the tin and the terrible joke that becomes the catalytic trigger. The key turn arises from their agency: choosing to laugh and crush the shards together. The price is subtle but present: vulnerability and parting after connection, with responsibility to keep the signal going. While escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial, it coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (mapping his own emotional terrain) is signaled early and tightens via the spiral and hush. The ring’s increasing weight and the forest’s narrowing walls create pressure that culminates in the kneel and release. The price is inward and credible for the mode: relinquishing accumulated languages and confronting what he feared to touch. Escalation is subtle rather than jagged, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring legible communication and reconfiguring a prior mistake—is signaled early and tightened by the anomaly’s flare and the dated‑tomorrow coordinates. Escalation proceeds via a decisive action (unbending the event) that exacts a price in station resources and future vigilance. The conflict remains primarily internal/procedural, so the felt peril is gentle, but the cadence shift is clear. Resolution is earned by her stance change rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure deepens as pretend capture disrupts the night, reframed as the first note, escalating into active conducting of absences. The live stake—can she transmute erasure into music—tightens into the final renunciation/embrace choice. The price (silence maintained, memory relinquished) is legible in the soundless tears and the empty camera reveal. Quiet, but the cadence shift and earned stasis read unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve truth/promise—tightens as the tapestry reweaves and the archive begins to fail. The collapse adds external pressure, but resistance is otherwise low, with no significant obstacle beyond deciphering. The internal conflict (destruction vs. preservation) resolves more by revelation than by contested choice. Cost is present but gentle, keeping escalation solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: separation vs transformative unity. Escalation is a clear cadence shift from tentative taps to a full orchestral crescendo that forces the choice. The price—self-dissolution—is unmistakable and tied to her agency. A minor sharpening of a foreclosed alternative (literal escape attempt) could raise the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around proving the whisper network amid storm constraints; escalation arrives with the seven‑corridor star, the three‑whisper challenge, and harmonic surge. Opposition is minimal and largely environmental; risks/readable prices remain modest. The key turn is protagonist‑driven and reweights options. Strong deepening, light cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent and early: can she teach darkness without breaking her silence. Pressure tightens through the secret’s urge to be spoken and the increasing complexity of shutter patterns, culminating in the mirror pressed to her chest. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial but still narrows options (speak and scatter the code vs endure and complete the transfer). The felt price is endurance and daily reweaving rather than a dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (liberating play from fixed rules) are legible and escalate through Mara’s organizing, the gathering, and the ritual insertion of the sapling. The tightening is a cadence shift rather than a hard trade-off; pressure coheres but meets little resistance. Agency is strong at the peak, and the reconfiguration is earned. The cost remains mostly conceptual, not biting on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus communal duty—is signaled early and tightens with the council’s plea and the choice to push off. The culminating act (unmaking the harpoon) deepens conflict into ethos, with a visible price. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent under the chosen lens. Slightly soft external opposition keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can intentional attention and craft create permissible lightness within enforced hush—tightens via the crow’s demand, the officer’s entrance, and the public planting gesture. Costs are legible: surveillance risk, sacrifice of bouquet, and a refusal to perform “hopeful noise” overtly (classifying as dirge). Escalation is accumulative, not reversal-driven, but pressure grows to a credible cadence shift. The lone tear provides a charged, not convenient, complicating response rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—translating a prohibition into passage—tighten via a decisive phonemic shift and the physical risk of mispronunciation. Escalation follows the accumulative lens: density of harmonics and environmental response deepen pressure rather than a series of reversals. The price is conceptual and reputational more than bodily, but it’s legible. A single stronger moment of near‑failure could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to see/make beauty—tightens when the eye reveals ugly‑beautiful fracture, forcing a new tactic: collaborate, then destroy to articulate the thesis. The decisive costs (smashing creations; renouncing painting; returning the eye) are earned and escalate meaning. Pressure coheres through the accumulative pattern of barters and replies (plants). Slight softness in explicit external jeopardy is offset by the clear internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (what connection is, post‑grid), and there is one meaningful tightening when her voiced question halts the room and triggers dismantling. Escalation remains gentle and largely uncontested; the collectors shift quickly without tangible resistance, lowering felt cost. The offering of the lens forecloses an old path but without a sharp trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal: whether she remains in preservational stasis or accepts transformation. Pressure coheres through an accumulative ritual, meaningfully tightening when she dissolves the stencil (sacrifice) and fixes a coordinate for her own departure. Lack of a bracing external counterforce or on-page resistance keeps the escalation gentle. Nevertheless, the final choice carries a visible price and resolves the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover a blueprint of collapse before memory erodes—is clear and tightens as the ritual complicates (vectors, rotations, thunder‑calibration) to the Ten‑of‑Swords/Four‑of‑Pentacles intersection. The discovery of the repeating sigil is the meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is more existential than immediate, but the sealing‑away choice forecloses further intervention on the page. Tension stays coherent, if calibrated to lyric pressure rather than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (purify without losing self) is declared early and tightens as the archive tempts assimilation. A meaningful deepening occurs when purification is redefined and she rejects solitary stewardship, choosing communal burden. The exit mechanic (“walk backward while facing forward”) functions as an earned tactic from the “avoid patterns” rule. External opposition resolves with relative ease, muting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keeping hope unshareable—tightens via the stone’s warming, the footage comparison, and the metamorphosis. The balcony decision is a credible narrowing of options (drop, keep, internalize) with real cost. Pressure deepens rather than flips, fitting the accumulative design. The resolution stems from her agency and forecloses a path (the dream market’s claim on hope).

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes—ethic reconstruction versus immediate animal care—tighten via the shedding ritual and the creation of a new code. The release of Aster, with vows installed above the door, forecloses a prior self-image and carries cost. Escalation is steady and coherent under the accumulative lens. No luck or coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing the miracle/achieving closure—tightens sharply at “Trade requires fresh loss.” The visible cost is her blood and the relived memory (sister’s laugh). Agency drives the turn and resolution; coincidence does not solve anything. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (recovering the lost lyrics/locating stored love) are signaled early and deepen as the film activates and Mara must add her own words. The key tightening is her decision to scratch new lyrics—an action that forecloses passive longing. Cost is primarily emotional but legible on the page. Pressure could be sharpened with one concrete risk or resistance beat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free creativity or let it perish—tightens through the meteor syllables culminating in the warning “create, or perish” and her agency to dismantle the tool she revered. The price is unmistakable: relinquishing the instrument and then her body. Pressure coheres and deepens rather than reverses, apt for the chosen lens. The escalation is internally driven, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—carry lullabies/children forward—tightens from naming to wave-function song to the decisive burying of the clock. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve anything. The cost is conceptual and practical (surrender of the clock and acceptance of divergent time). Pressure is coherent, though internal friction remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: wonder versus self‑erasure, tightened by the jaguar’s proposition. The on‑page trade‑off (drop the gear) narrows options and exacts a price, and the subsequent transformation proves consequence rather than coincidence. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern intensification under the accumulative lens. If anything, opposition is largely internal, but it’s sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (unprotected crossing; tangled routes). Escalation is mostly a single deepening (the hound’s howl → confrontation → stamp) with little resistance or trade-off. The final choice is clear and protagonist-driven but pays a light price; tension never tightens to a hard squeeze. Effective but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are focused: preserving the fortress vs. the cost in voices. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the lens—boy’s arrival, surgical climax, collective breathing—culminating in acceptance of an ongoing price. Agency expresses as endurance and attention (“remain”), a deliberate renunciation with cost. Slightly static by design, but the tightening is unmistakable at the candlelit closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the pretender arrives, the clue escalates, and the ink’s touch narrows options to exposure. The titan’s agency drives the turn, though the opposition resolves quickly once the rune activates. Stakes skew conceptual—cosmic balance—more than visceral peril, softening the felt price. Still, the choice to act gently yet irrevocably lands as a meaningful commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering a disappeared path) is signaled and tightens through the answering taps and the descent. Escalation is knowledge- and pattern-driven rather than peril-driven, fitting the lens. The decisive act (inserting the page) narrows options and triggers irreversible change. Cost is quieter than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reignite sky/resistance—tightens through a single, meaningful deepening as song becomes instrument, then ignition and broadcast. Agency drives turns and the refusal to flee is clear. The price is implied (risking militia attention, forgoing private escape) but not sharply dramatized. Lack of a counter‑force in scene keeps escalation from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (wresting destiny from the council) tightens through deciphering, descent, and the guard interruption that forces adaptive tactics. Agency drives the turn (she chooses to cut the sac), with visible risk and time pressure (radio, dozing guard). The price is credible if quiet—illegal action, potential punishment, and bodily strain. Escalation is singular but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—living with memory without surrendering to it—is tested and tightened by the freeze ritual and the resin act, culminating in releasing the photo. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, consistent with the lens, and the price is unmistakable. The agency is a renunciation with visible loss and a new constraint (image fixed to the tree, photo gone). Tension operates line to line via the wind/sea and the narrator’s somatic tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—make a portrait that overcomes loss—tightens as the building physically closes in, forcing the redesign method and final descent. The meaningful turn arrives with the mirror revealing absence, not her; the trade‑off is acceptance of a door into drowning. Agency drives escalation at each step rather than coincidence. Stakes remain intimate but palpable, with a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and narrows toward the portal choice; the reversal is the shadow/ink circle revealing Lyra in a time‑fold. Escalation is mainly knowledge‑driven (journal, hourglass pattern), with one tangible tightening (drone’s “fear,” independent shadow) before the leap. The cost—self‑annihilating passage and forsaking the ordinary timeline—is legible. A beat of concrete resistance (environment or tool failure) could have further sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stakes are signaled early and escalate as Sera moves from hesitation to decisive leak, then to costly withdrawal into the pod. The choice forecloses safety and risks the archive’s destruction; explosions and approaching citizens externalize the stakes. The moral calculus (truth vs. preservation) sharpens at the peak. One strong tightening turn is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: transform ruin into continuity. Pressure deepens via night-long labor and the decision to bind the violent artifact into the living graft, culminating in planting and listening for roots. Escalation is more textural than oppositional; consequences are conceptual rather than biting. The cost is felt but understated, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (catch the echo) and tightens when the star‑goddess threatens to “burn the garden silent.” Escalation is protagonist‑driven: the spike redeploys the garden’s physics, forcing a narrowing of options. The price paid is primarily conceptual (renouncing the demanded “cry” to assert silence as agency and accepting conversation over capture). A slightly more embodied cost would push this higher, but tension scales well for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are singular and legible: alter the orbit of regret by contesting truth. Escalation tracks via a because/therefore chain within the lyric frame: assumptions → contradictions collide → orbit resists → she sacrifices the nib to force the final line. The price is unmistakable and tied to her identity and method. Resolution arises from her choice, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (quelling guilt) is signaled early and tightens with the lab’s predatory revelation and the binding letters. The second menu crystallizes a true trade-off; slicing the paper chain and releasing the insect is an active, earned resolution. The price is primarily internal—she foregoes “BECOME LULLABY”—which reads but could be made more viscerally unavoidable.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal (will she accept impermanence and find meaning), signaled early and tightened through the hush’s approval and the tile’s single-message test. Escalation arrives via density increase and a pattern break (spiral to straight line) consistent with the lens. The cost is legible in the deliberate obliteration of the mandala and surrender of the tile’s echoes. Absence of a counterforce character limits friction but does not flatten the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around choosing what to forget and what that costs; the tightening comes as she assigns each tessera to a released memory and then removes herself and the stone. Stakes are moral and personal rather than adversarial, but they escalate via the dawn deadline and the exacting numerology. The price—identity shift, leaving the city, ceding judgment—reads clearly. Quiet but decisive deepening suits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming possibility/memory) is signaled early and tightens through the woven ritual culminating in the heartbeat and applause. Agency drives the turn (coin + thread + stage work), not coincidence; Lila mid‑scene intensifies but doesn’t solve it for him. The cost is present but gentle; pressure rises more through density than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres under an accumulative lens: awareness intensifies into compulsion, the group’s lights converge, and Maya’s pivot from “Stop” to intentional healing narrows her options. The meaningful tightening is her acceptance—choosing to connect rather than resist—recasting the stakes from personal overload to communal repair. Costs (vulnerability, relinquishing control) are implied rather than sharply dramatized. The escalation feels organic, if not harrowingly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: witness the unknown before it drowns. Pressure tightens at the cold node and culminates in the decision to merge with/voice the unknown, with a physical and existential price. Escalation is more interior than adversarial; a touch more overt jeopardy might have amplified tension. Still, the costed choice narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—repairing the future’s mechanism—tightens via releasing the echo, the night-long spiral work, and the decision to reseal and bear the jar outward. Escalation is measured as density shifts rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The price (renouncing the tower, accepting stewardship of possibility) is legible but not harshly dramatized. Still, agency drives each turn and the ending stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure grows via constraints (weather‑scoured cipher, dead keypad, dwindling power, physical pain) toward a confession that risks annihilation. The key tightening is his choice to transmit and then foreclose future covers by crushing the pillbox. External antagonism stays offstage, but internal and logistical stakes interlock cleanly. The price is unmistakable and alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (cross or sink; distill to essence) tightens under the live clock and culminates in a costly transformation. Escalation is gentle but undeniable: threading memory into a filament, silence sealing the world, and the irreversible dissolution of the coach. Agency guides each turn (he disembarks, threads, accepts the sphere, walks on). The conflict is largely internal/ritualized rather than contested, but the price is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether kindness can stitch time and revive a dead place, tightening as the thrum deepens and Lin commits to specific, ritualized acts. The meaningful turn is her choice to align fractured reflections, which reweights options and permits the bees’ return. The price is an ethical/temporal one: accepting impermanence and moving on, leaving the hive to harden without fire. The conflict is more meditative than adversarial, which softens the felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—getting the boy to sky/light—tightens credibly at the locked door and in the dark stairwell. Escalation comes from Mara’s agency (using the tooth, managing silence, guiding ascent), with a felt price at the end (tool lost, ongoing risk). The conflict remains intimate yet charged, avoiding soft resets. The quiet stakes read viscerally without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—maintaining self without shattering into extinction‑loneliness—tightens at the henge where she pays by forfeiting communal memory. Escalation reads as a deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to the lens. Costs are legible (memory split, herd lost) and drive subsequent tactics (strapping the sundial, becoming “her own dawn”). Some later marvels feel epilogue‑like and slightly diffuse the peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconnection/authorship) tightens through service to the woman, recognition of her own words in the mirrors, and the throat‑offering confession. Escalation is a lyric deepening rather than a sharp reversal, with cost mostly internal and conceptual. The final renunciation is earned and forecloses a path, but external pressure remains low, softening urgency. Still, the cadence shift at the bells provides a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible early (trust, autonomy, social fracture), and pressure coheres toward the eclipse. The meaningful tightening is Mara’s timed interference against an active counterpush by the tricksters. The price is stated (becoming their enemy), but on‑page felt cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key versus suffocation panic—tightens through the organ’s impossible pressure and the geometry’s betrayal. The crucial narrowing comes with the circle pivot and the mirror‑room bargain; options are clarified into a costly yes/no. Agency drives the outcome; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The on‑page price (tunnels shut forever) is lucid and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (forcing recognition vs town’s amnesia) tightens through the disciplined ritual into a decisive turn (lancing the painted heel). Escalation is protagonist-driven; coincidence (scent release) complicates but does not resolve. The cost is quieter—emotional renunciation and exposing her work to authority—but palpable. Pressure coheres under a causal–lyric hybrid without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring erased bravery—tightens through concrete turns: decoding under storm pressure, challenging Voss, risking a flight in dangerous weather. The price is on‑page (physical risk, social risk, and the chosen cost of remaining in exile conditions). External opposition from the Ministry softens quickly, limiting late‑stage resistance. Still, escalation coheres under the causal lens and culminates in an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (refusing “never”) and tightens as the performance alters the world. The peak choice—risking loss by crushing the flake and taking the rasterized hand—forecloses safety and the path of refusal. Father‑fall memory deepens pressure, intertwining internal and external stakes. Escalation is clear and protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres through an accumulative deepening: markers shift from warnings to signatures, compelling the protagonist’s ritual of release. The choice narrows options by trading possession and legacy for earned stasis. The outsider’s footsteps briefly externalize stakes without deflating the internal conflict. Quiet mode keeps the tension intimate but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres under the chosen lens: the predicted fade creates a ticking window; her speaking of syllables and tool‑healing escalate meaning. The decisive deepening is the inscription’s reconfiguration into a credo that alters her stance and bond with the boy. Stakes remain mostly internal/spiritual, with limited friction or foreclosed options on the page. Nonetheless, the trade—solitary bearing of grief for shared stewardship—carries felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether she will voice the confession at real cost, tightened by the seventh-circle mirror and the awakened seed that might devour her. The chosen act forecloses her prior evasive tactic (freezing truth) and accepts binding and judgment. External peril is more implied than tested, but the internal moral stake reads high and concrete. Escalation is cumulative and purposeful rather than twist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single tightening: the gardener’s question forces a stance between future/past; the choice forecloses those paths in favor of the “green minute.” Stakes are primarily spiritual/temporal, and escalation is more deepening than jeopardy. The cost is soft but present (hosting the hedge, feeding fears to the sky). The communal circle amplifies consequence without dispersing the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: relief from war memories at the price of something precious. Pressure tightens when sunrise is refused and the mother’s hum is required, forcing a meaningful trade‑off. After the cost is paid, the attempted reversal tests commitment and is refused in a way that reweights the premise. Consequences persist (lost hum, Lira’s hollowing), and the final stance is earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (purpose after public failure) is signaled early and tightens through the echo and the paint fleck, culminating in the phone call. Internal and external pressures braid well, though the on-page price is largely emotional rather than visibly consequential. The turn is earned and narrows options (choosing to reengage community over isolation). A small added friction or loss would have further sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (restore meaning/archive; reconcile absence) are signaled early and deepen through the arbor’s sentence, the seed’s responses, and the symmetry reveal. The protagonist’s agency drives each intensification (translation choices, lullaby, etching the equation). The price is mostly internal; no hard trade‑off narrows options beyond acceptance. Still, pressure coheres and grows under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—guarding wonder/identities against dissolution—tightens as the moon “pulls contradictions outward,” compelling the irreversible planting of the creel. The escalation is a deepening of pressure rather than reversal, fitting the lens. Cost is present (risk of self‑forgetting, planned future release), though the on‑page resistance is mostly lyrical rather than perilous. Agency drives the resolution with an earned renunciation of perfect control.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are personal and thematic (isolation vs. connective witness) and tighten as space narrows to the mirror and crown. The decisive act—putting on the crown and surrendering the pearl—carries an unmistakable price and redefines options. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial but coherent and felt. No cheap coincidence resolves the conflict; her agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) escalates through a ritual sequence that narrows options: speak/play → copy/add coordinates → boat launch → silence. The choice to cease medicating and to accept visions as “maps” heightens risk and cost. The felt price is unmistakable at the end (renouncing endless atonement for a present-tense stay). Quiet, but the tightening is clear and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (gain/document the unspoken) tightens as time-language debts mount: watch stutters, algae dim, library begins to collapse. Turns are protagonist-driven (unsay lie; pay memory; seize key), and each carries a visible price. Pressure coheres under the stated rules; coincidence does not resolve. The reset carries consequence rather than a soft erase.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (order vs. living, perforated freedom) is signaled early and tightened by the fracture reveal and the droplet’s commodification vision. The orchids’ “scream” and the etched lightning-crack sharpen the moral calculus. Lira’s third-path action escalates pressure and forecloses earlier options. The price (self-removal and unstable, perforated outcomes) reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: preserve a spark before oblivion. The meaningful tightening is the realization that the sought spark is her own, forcing a trade—self for preserved others. While external opposition is minimal, the internal calculus escalates under the accumulative lens and culminates in a costly act. The price is unmistakable and reconfigures the world’s moral ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: will she pursue upward escape or pay the cost to repair the valley. The key tightening arrives when the boy dissolves; her pin-stab both anchors him and exacts a price. The law of the cycle demands a death; the boy’s decisive step forces her earned renunciation and descent, with consequences echoed valley‑wide.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ethical complicity—tightens via the cracked bell’s message and the void‑shard confrontation. Escalation is internal but legible: decoding → witnessing through void → forced choice; the price is to relinquish investor‑facing certainty. A bolder on‑page counterpush from a team member could have sharpened pressure further. Still, the refusal to launder guilt and the team’s unhooked certainty provide a credible narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (transfer of forbidden knowledge before Elara vanishes), and escalation arrives via the patterned rings culminating in the delayed fourth revelation. Agency is modest—Elara’s main act is the drop; Marcus primarily watches—so pressure feels ritualistic rather than contested. The cost is present but the narrowing of options is conceptual, not fought through reversals. Effective deepening, limited friction.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is early and consistent; escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than external conflict. The pressure tightens when birds form the living arrow backward and he chooses stillness, foreclosing the path of motion. Cost is subtle but legible in the surrender to the canyon’s rhythm. No antagonist, but internal and environmental forces interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when the doorway shrinks under curfew and he must choose what to carry back; taking and then letting go (mailing the petal) marks a real trade‑off. The keystone’s fracture is a visible price that reweights the world’s rules. Pressure is internal/systemic rather than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens under the accumulative lens. The escalation is quiet yet unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (discovering the color of sound vs. duty to guide) is signaled early and deepens through the dive and the safe’s recording. A meaningful tightening occurs at the cylinder’s play and the captain’s instruction, which forces Jin’s stance to crystallize. The price—risk of drowning, potential dereliction—is present but not pressed into a hard dilemma. Resolution stems from Jin’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (align meaning vs. personal survival) tightens through a decisive deepening when the Earth coin “screamed” and the completed prophecy demands self‑erasure. The choice forecloses a life path with visible cost and resolves through her agency. Tension escalates through density and cadence rather than antagonistic reversals, appropriate to the lens. Stakes never lapse into mere declaration; they materialize in the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reckoning with the cost of his existence—tightens via a decisive intensification when the star‑sentences cohere into “What was sacrificed for you?”. He pays a visible price by confronting accusation (the brother’s gaze) and enacting release (shattering the cylinders, surrendering the trapped voices). Agency drives the escalation and resolution under the accumulative lens. The final step onto “borrowed” starlight reads as earned stasis/charged poise with cost acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: restore the sea by restoring belief. Escalation is a patterned tightening—drip rate increases, seven-day vigil, the bell’s single ring—culminating in the ocean’s partial return and the communal handoff. Agency is endurance and ritual, with a real price (life spent, death). Pressure stays coherent without an antagonist; the brittle-devotion problem deepens via the dolphin’s line and the community solution.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes center on how to steward resurfacing memory; the photo-trail intensifies pressure by shifting the personal stake (her father’s secret) into direct conflict with duty. The decisive act—tearing the label and redirecting the narrative—forecloses a path with felt cost. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the accumulative lens. A single deepening turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres: locating the crystal via starlings, drawing the circle, the fire’s reveal, and the choice to melt. The live clock (“final transformation…horizon bled indigo”) tightens the moment. Cost is more spiritual than tangible, which keeps escalation elegant but a shade soft. Agency is clear and drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve trust vs. expose network) tightens with the stolen signal and the instructor’s cadence. The choice to descend and then to pass the buckle narrows options and pays a price (loss of control/symbol of office). Tension scales at sentence and beat levels without redundancy. The masked “older self” deepening raises ethical calculus rather than offering an easy exit.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are legible early (custody or dissolution), and pressure tightens through the confession duel, Zero’s moment of failure, and the rewrite bell as a live clock. The decisive act (Mara’s choice to merge) forecloses the ritual’s either/or with an on-page cost. Internal and external conflicts braid cleanly. Escalation reads earned and coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (keep the haven safe and escapable) is signaled early with a live clock (“second thunderclap”). Escalation tracks through the seed’s takeover and Mira’s decision to direct growth instead of resisting it. The danger feels largely managed once she syncs with the levers, softening felt cost at the peak. Still, the tactical redirection of vines into clues is a credible tightening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring laughter—tightens through an accumulative escalation: raw howl, modulation, emergence of giggle, communal ripple, and machine failure forcing acceptance. Agency drives the turns (starting, throttling gentler, killing the throttle, choosing to stop), and the price is the acknowledgment that memory, not resurrection, is the attainable outcome. The engine’s death forecloses a path with cost yet leaves a charged residue in the environment. Tension operates at sentence and story scales without contrived antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes concentrate around whether she endures uncertainty as absence or attendance; pressure deepens through thicker mist, the pendant heating, and the sundial’s refusal to cast a shadow. The key tightening is her decision to stop prowling and let the garden interiorize her—foreclosing the old identity. Cost is visible in the self‑dissolution and abandonment of “guardian” as role. Escalation is more textural than adversarial but remains coherent and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens through purposeful steps: repair fails to equal life, contradiction via ash escalates, and the cost spikes at the sacrifice. Stakes—interrupting destiny at risk of unleashing a stranger cage—are made explicit by the creature’s warning. The agency-led renunciation (sight) provides the concrete price. Conflict is mostly situational and thematic rather than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (tune the hush before it eats transmissions) and deepens into a reframed objective by mid‑scene. The key tightening is her decision to feed the fragment, trading a talisman for a risky integration that could amplify or resolve the threat. The price is visible and the outcome reconfigures options, though the opposition remains mostly conceptual, limiting felt jeopardy. Tension accrues via density and cadence rather than reversals, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure escalates from eerie drift to a time-pressured choice when the grotto closes and the hourglass heats. The radio heartbeats and pattern-steering create concrete tactical stakes; the ship solidifies beat by beat. The climactic decision—flip again and command a merge—resolves via agency with a felt price. The earlier “one must be poured into the other” tension resolves a bit cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates under the accumulative lens as her weaving provokes systemic shifts (“walls erupting,” neural network awakening) toward a charged center. The price—empty spool and relinquishing the composite man—lands. Still, the conflict is primarily conceptual; few foreclosed options or trade-offs occur midstream. The single tightening suffices but doesn’t bite hard.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—retain a true “direction” under alien‑warped stars—is signaled early and tightens when the alien craft validates edge geometry, prompting the private, higher‑cost lesson. The decisive narrowing arrives as she gives away the relic and the boy assumes solo watch. Prices are legible (relinquishing the last surface tether; physical toll on the boy). The pressure is more conceptual than perilous, but remains coherent and escalating under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the duty to deliver assurance, tightening when the pulse grows urgent and the woman appears. The key turn is Mira choosing to bridge the living with the dead by surrendering the photograph. The price is quiet but legible—relinquishing her ongoing “call” (aid goes silent). There’s little resistance or reversal beyond urgency; the piece earns its quiet register.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the unremembered—tightens as the passage narrows and each named technician raises emotional cost. The key deepening is the realization that speaking names changes the state, culminating in the hand‑over‑hand reversal at the trunk. Price is endured (panic vs duty) and then reframed into ongoing responsibility. A touch more jeopardy or failure risk on a beat could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: reclaim embodied agency and meaning before administrative erasure. Pressure escalates through the live clocks (radio static, dawn) and the irreversible act of slicing the “digital film” to reassemble, then confronting the clerk. The price—leaving the safety of ghosthood, exposing himself, and relinquishing midnight solace—reads. Conflict is quiet but real; tension rides cadence and commitment rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving a dying language—tightens through a visible tradeoff: each slowed heartbeat yields clearer phonemes at the cost of life. Agency drives escalation: she initiates the rite, speaks the first word, accepts the seep, and swallows the stone. The final state forecloses her survival while securing communal continuance. Tension rises at sentence and beat scales without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief/bitterness) is signaled early and tightens when mentor reframes the quarry and the arrowhead activates. The escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, but it narrows options: hunt versus become. The choice to surrender and ascend is protagonist‑driven with a clear price. Pressure remains coherent without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (save the orchard’s living beauty) is signaled early and escalates through concrete turns: rhythmic signaling, lullaby inversion, seed extraction. Resistance from the statues is brief but coherent and answered by adaptive tactics. The price is felt more in relinquishment than harm, so pressure is strong rather than punishing. The cadence shift at closure tightens options (no bridge to return across; she departs) credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (get the memory virus into the system under drone scrutiny) is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation reads via the uncorking, sensor pivot, Sal’s timing, and the first raindrop—a meaningful tightening. The price is risk and exposure rather than a concrete loss; the win comes too cleanly to crest higher. Still, agency drives every turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal (can silence be possibility?) but pressure coheres and tightens: rumor → discovery → halo’s counter‑reveal (it reveals what’s within, not grants) demands agency via song. The meaningful deepening is the reinterpretation of silence culminating in a choice to depart along a self‑made staff of notes. The felt price is quiet—no confrontation—but the renunciation is real and scaled to length. A hair more tangible jeopardy could raise intensity, but it’s not required for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates via density and pattern shift: ordinary stacks → hyperbolic corridor → door → shell room → tearing the scarf. The price is unmistakable and resolves the dominant stake through renunciation. Tension is quiet rather than adversarial but remains coherent under the accumulative lens. A touch more friction or a near‑miss would have heightened the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the dream to restore erased voices—is clear and tightens as dawn nears. Escalation peaks with the dream’s appearance and the “decisive frame,” paying off earlier risks; the palette cracking and the light implosion signal cost. The risk of trading an unnamed memory is introduced but not explicitly tallied, softening the price. Even so, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens when stitches turn to moths yet the mouth won’t open—necessitating the disorientation tactic. Stakes remain singular and legible: liberate the first thought of peace, with dread as mechanism. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (star’s hint) complicates but does not resolve. The price is more symbolic than visceral, tempering intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens at the sextant/mushroom exchange; the fairy ring’s urging creates a credible pressure point. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency through a concrete counter‑tactic (scalpel over surrender). The price reads more as relinquishing the habit of forgetting than a fresh loss, so the felt cost is modest. Tension nevertheless holds sentence to sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible early: save the library vs. personal cost of reversal. Escalation deepens through ritual acts and the library’s tangible responses; the child’s entrance narrows options and forces stance crystallization. The price is felt—Lira takes on the remembering burden and forecloses an easier path. Quiet, but the tightening is unmistakable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: trap and replant wonder before it drains away. Pressure tightens when the weave pulls back and the veil becomes a door, forcing a trade-off between preservation and release. The chosen resolution is a renunciation with visible cost and wider consequence. Slightly soft on pre‑decision resistance, but escalation remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are singular and legible: perfecting a mask versus freeing a spirit, with a career identity on the line. Escalation is clean—each knot’s release raises the emotional and thematic cost until the final knot forces a binary choice. The price is explicit: she loses her vocation and breaks the mask. Resolution is protagonist‑driven without coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how to approach the unknown—tightens from analytic scrutiny to an ethical method (witnessing without demand). The key deepening is her decision to wait, which forecloses a conquest path and enables the reknit map. Pressure is quiet but coherent; the cost is conceptual rather than perilous, yet palpable. No luck resolves the problem; her stance does.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to let go without betrayal—is signaled early and tightens as Mara shifts from cataloguing to enacting release. The key turn is her agency: unscrewing the globe and substituting her brother’s tags, a renunciation with visible cost. Pressure coheres through accumulative density rather than reversals, culminating in the ascent with Fred steadying, not claiming, her. Slight softness: external risk is minimal; the tension remains largely internal but is credibly scaled for length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (speak needs before thunder erases them) tightens under a real clock. The echo’s accusation deepens pressure and forces the turning choice to release the preserved petals—foreclosing her prior strategy. Thunder’s arrival reweights the graffiti into anthem, making the price and pay-off legible. Stakes are emotional and communal rather than mortal, but they escalate convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are personal but coherent: will Lira remain a servant of mourning or become a steward of hidden joy. Escalation deepens via discovery beats and the pivotal decision to descend and plant, with visible forfeitures en route. The tension is more accumulative than adversarial, but agency consistently drives turns. A slightly softer antagonistic force keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via the live clock of the fraying cable and an escalating catalog (from “Regret” to releasing kites to the final snap). Agency drives the turn: Mara chooses to memorialize, disperse, and ultimately step out—sacrificing safety to prevent forgetting. The cost is clear and reconfigures options. A single additional beat of risk to the body or a hard counterforce would push tension even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve what matters before demolition—tightens with the siren and root‑borne vibrations. Her tactic shift (faces → sky/negative space via the coin’s notches) is a meaningful deepening driven by agency. Cost is legible: she abandons the sanctuary to rubble and accepts that her portrait will be unreadable to her. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres and climbs.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (ship going dark/becoming a ghost; Lira’s belonging) is signaled early and tightens as lamps dim further. The meaningful turn occurs with Lira’s decision to translate and read, fusing inner drive with external stakes. Yet the conflict resolves swiftly once the engineer names the need, reducing friction and price at the peak. Still, pressure coheres and deepens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: failed humming, mocking reflections, then the reversal via recognizing asynchronous mirrors to heal the key. The cost and narrowing are clear—time bound to totality, and the eventual sealing‑in. Escalation stems from Rowan’s agency rather than luck. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, with internal and external threads interlocking.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—save the orchards before the eclipse—tightens through staged mobilization, mistrust → trust, and the dangerous harvest chain. The key deepening is Mara proving reliability through labor and becoming literal counterweight, narrowing options to collective action. The price is legible: risk aloft and Mara’s relinquishment of presence. Tension breathes but continues to rise to the arch‑righting sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are singular and legible: avert midnight or accept personal erasure. Escalation arrives via the recursive lullaby that renders the pane transparent and forces the bargain, narrowing options to a costly endurance. The reversal—midnight retreating—intensifies the price, culminating in a permanent sacrifice. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure tightens via the ticking frost, the “seven lies” fork, and the birds’ surveillance; options narrow visibly. Escalation flows from Mara’s agency—switching from arrows to the kernel-smeared handprint when voice and proximity fail. The kernel’s sacrifice and the roused birds sharpen cost and risk in the peak beat. Resolution is earned without coincidence, rooted in the established constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—atonement by transforming separation into tactile connection—is signaled early and tightens through the insight, build, and public release. Escalation is accumulative/textural rather than adversarial, but the price is legible in the renunciation at the end. One meaningful deepening occurs when strangers engage the pieces, validating the risk. Slight softness: limited opposition or reversals beyond internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—stewarding beginnings without collapsing the library—tightens via the boy’s transaction, the librarian’s destabilization, the patron surge, and the building’s sag. The cost clarifies progressively, culminating in her renunciation. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening. The moral calculus is present but lightly sketched rather than knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—how to engage with accumulated grief—tightens when human sorrow widens to oceanic timescales and she must risk self-dissolution to answer it. The pivotal act (reversing her gift to give memories) is a genuine tradeoff and resolves pressure without coincidence. Internal and external conflicts braid well. Stakes remain felt rather than abstract via embodied sensory cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear early (farmers need the elevator’s note; silence aches) and pressure deepens as Mireya moves from fix to covenant. Escalation is primarily density/ritual rather than jeopardy; the tightening is the time window to dawn and the elevator’s ultimatum (“build me a bridge”). Cost and trade‑off are gentle, not searing, which tempers peak tension. The 4:43 turn is a satisfying intensification rather than a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressured: extract dreams without self‑overwriting or death. Escalation tightens via the live clock (moon zenith and slide) and the precise angle constraint; Mara’s agency triggers the fusion and the partial build. The collapse exacts a visible price and narrows options going forward. Internal and external conflicts interlock without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—consumption vs custodianship vs a third, self‑erasing path—tightens as the doodle becomes a lock and the manuscript’s glow pulls her into the threshold. The decisive act is hers, with a visible price (identity translated). Pressure is primarily internal; the hour clock is present but underused as an active squeeze. Still, escalation reads as a focused deepening consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and singular: rekindling voice in a long‑silent world. Pressure deepens through process (mapping pitches → first ping → grove’s reply → statue’s breathy alto), with Ilay’s choices driving each intensification. The price is mostly restraint and physical/temporal attunement rather than a hard loss, but it lands. Quiet tension replaces overt antagonism without feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose to act before the next phase—is signaled and tightened when the silence resolves into readable patterns. Escalation is a deepening of pattern density rather than overt conflict, appropriate to the lens. The decision forecloses passive endurance, but the felt price and live alternatives are lightly sketched. Absence of a counterforce on the page limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unlocking a testimony without harm—is signaled early and tightened by the fireworks countdown and the diary’s “frequency.” The meaningful turn arrives when she sings back, converting curation into participation. The resolution is earned through her ethos rather than coincidence, though resistance is minimal and largely internal. The price—becoming an archive—reads, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure mounts through timing and precision (waiting for the seed’s “breath,” knot choice, avoiding pollinators) and culminates in an internal trade‑off. The tightening is gentle but clear: execute the graft without disturbing tide or spirits versus performative ambition. The visible cost is renunciation rather than risk of failure; nonetheless, the escalation reads coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via the inversion window and the silent-core approach, peaking with the insertion of the shard and the memory-for-trait exchange. Agency drives the turns; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is legible but largely internal and lyrical, which keeps tension luminous rather than jagged. Still, the hour waning provides a clean narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stakes (survive, document, warn) are established early and escalate to the 200-knot spiral and collapse. Her choice to trust the patch and squeeze through the gap is the key tightening. The price is primarily situational risk and the city’s loss rather than a personal sacrifice on the page. Pressure remains coherent and grows without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit and pressured by a precise timing constraint; escalation tightens toward the single, irrevocable strike. The price lands (bell cracked; world altered), and the protagonist’s agency drives the outcome. Stakes skew conceptual more than perilous, so jeopardy feels serene rather than harrowing. Still, the cadence shift at impact is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are tight and focused: understand and risk re‑opening the rift versus renounce and accept cost. Pressure coheres and deepens as the hush thickens, the seam manifests, and the mirror offers a crossing; the decisive tightening is her refusal and offering. The price—loss of the relic and foreclosed passage—is clear and felt. A minor softness lies in the absence of external antagonism, but internal/external weave maintains tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: save/gather the vanishing stars and selves versus keep borrowed lives. Escalation is driven by Quince’s choices (borrowing the astronomer, engaging the halo, reversing the press) and narrows options. The child’s apparition is a strong tightening that forces a trade‑off. Consequences persist in the blankness and vow not to borrow again.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (remain courier vs. become legend) tightens as vibration intensifies and the stranger reframes his role. The decisive act—walking forward—reads as agency with a conceptual price. Escalation is smooth but low-friction; the alternative path is legible but not forcefully contested. A slightly deeper on-page cost would heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (release vs retention of grief) tightens through the ritualized “truthful lies” and the deepening hush. The pivotal renunciation—admitting “I need you still” and leaving the cracked prism—forecloses a path with cost. Escalation is a decisive intensification rather than multiple turns, apt for the lyric lens. Stakes remain coherent and felt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens from an expectant silence to an irreversible sacrifice; the bargain focuses the dominant stake. The chime, dimming orchard, and swallow-shaped absence escalate cleanly under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable—her voice for distance—and persists in the aftermath. A touch more articulated inner resistance at the decision beat could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early (the debt at moonrise; planet’s posture toward fear) and pressure tightens through the jam, the fall, and the confrontation. Corin’s agency drives turns, and the gong plus mural escalate from stealth to open defiance. Visible costs and narrowed options are legible. Antagonistic pressure is credible but briefly resolved, slightly lowering peak strain.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering and weighing withheld truth—tightens through the loom traversal and the zero‑g discovery to the complicity reveal. Agency drives escalations (stepping into strands, prying the locker, ingesting the cube, choosing a new mapping ethic). The cost is conceptual and moral rather than physical, but it’s legible and charges the resolution. A more acute on‑page setback or trade‑off would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres under an accumulative lens: lamp dies early, horizon “stitched with black wire,” fear she’s gone; he escalates by adding a second cairn and sequestering the glass. Stakes are singular—maintain the chain and witness absence—and the cost is his ongoing solitude and limited agency. The stone’s click tightens to a fragile reprieve rather than relief without price. Quiet, but the deepening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to accept the geas and translate shadow into dawn—tightens through each laugh’s price and the wick’s dwindling. Agency drives the major turns: pressing the wick, choosing to laugh again despite erasing stars, steering the structure off its foundation. Costs are felt and accumulate toward the dissolution of the lighthouse and her role. The escalation remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal—finding the donor’s final tale to understand story‑magnetism—with one strong tightening when the wing falls and yields the miners’ vision. The methodical tracking and the flask’s release of voices deepen pressure toward the absorption moment. Cost is felt but quiet; the piece favors deepening over hard reversal, which fits the lens but limits intensity. Consequences carry into the return image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent—reduce quantified sorrow and learn what trees witness—and tighten with the pin’s chime and the spectral tree realization. Escalation is mostly deepening rather than conflictual; the primary price is the sextant’s sacrifice and Mara’s renunciation of measurement. No antagonist, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens. The cadence shift at deconstruction provides the needed turn.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (reviving the realm) is tested on the page with one strong tightening: the attack that breaks the mica forces a higher‑cost choice. The self‑inflicted wound and shift to communal canon mark earned adaptation, not coincidence. Pressure remains coherent from silence → chorus → sunlight breach. Visible prices and narrowed options make the peak turn credible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is survival/atonement under the purge clock; pressure tightens at midnight and with approaching footsteps. Elara’s agency creates the reversal by choosing absorption over flight, paying the price of selfhood. Internal and external conflicts braid cleanly; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. A credible renunciation resolves the tension rather than a convenient rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—countering creeping normality—intensifies through the guerrilla plantings, the shoots’ emergence, and the frost-night reveal. The meaningful tightening is Mila’s decision to plant (foreclosing the immediate comfort of eating) and to persist quietly under scrutiny. Cost is present as risk of failure, secrecy, and ongoing vigilance rather than overt peril. Tension is steady, if quietly scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep measuring or to preserve meaning beyond measurement—is established and tightened by the library’s counter‑move (archiving her). Escalation is a clear pattern break under the accumulative lens: she narrows the beam, magnifies a vow, then halts the instrument. The cost is felt: she forecloses her professional mandate and accepts uncertainty. Pressure remains coherent without requiring an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (recording trust breaking by dawn) is clear and tightened by the sunrise deadline and the father’s no‑show. Pressure accrues through waiting, false starts, and the market’s hush until a paid price (the fob) seals the outcome. Agency is renunciatory but decisive; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. The felt loss reweights options after the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure deepens via pattern: the convergence forms a triangle, the ring spins wildly, and the election premise narrows options to acceptance. Stakes are internal (understanding/role), and escalation is more density than conflict; there’s one meaningful tightening at the reveal. Price is subdued—no hard trade‑off beyond a reorientation of vocation. Still, the cadence shift at the meeting provides sufficient turn for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (legacy/creativity vs. memory’s trap) is signaled early and tightens as she chooses to draw despite pain. The decisive act—completing/collaborating on the portrait—triggers the cave and the lock, leading to an earned, cost‑bearing aboveground stance. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and escalating; coincidence (the found canvas) complicates rather than resolves. A faint ease from the magical assist keeps it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres through the candid‑answer junctures and the “tomorrow” deadline, with one clear tightening at the mailbox’s test. The price is primarily emotional exposure; no option is foreclosed on the page despite the warning. Escalation is steady rather than bracing, carried by discovery more than loss. The final turn reweights meaning but skirts an unmistakable on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keeping wonder’s color alive—is tightened by the comet’s ticking approach and the irreversible consumption of ancient ice. Agency steers escalation (calibration decisions, endurance of silence, the final gifting), with a felt price paid. Pressure is lyric rather than adversarial but coheres under the accumulative lens. Slight softness in overt external resistance keeps the tension elegant rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve farm vs. preserve/transform memory-self) is signaled early and tightens as the shift nears completion. The box’s refusal to compress escalates pressure and forces K-17’s decisive choice to root and open the box to flame. The price—self-transformation and centuries of waiting—is felt. The escalation is clean and agency-driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: solve vs. listen; the tightening is the heartbeat discovery leading to a refusal to open. Pressure coheres by cadence and density, culminating in the communal silent vigil that narrows options to witnessing. The cost is conceptual—abandoning solution for presence—and it’s legible. External antagonism is minimal, but under the chosen lens, escalation reads.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stakes—finish the encryption before the web completes—intensify through one decisive deepening: ride the vortex to the archive and ingest the seed. The price is legible (surrendering the page/body, the lab’s last breath) and the escape path narrows with the live clock. The “double threes” beat leans on chance, but it’s integrated into the story’s ethos and doesn’t handwave the turn. Resolution is clearly earned by her renunciation and broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear: reclaiming a deleted past before it petrifies. Escalation arrives via the gravity surge that both threatens and enables the attempt, forcing trade‑offs (feeding the matchbook, accepting an untouchable reunion). The resolution grows from Mael’s agency and costs her tangible tokens and some absence transference (flame stretching to feed on what’s missing). Conflict remains primarily situational/inner, yet the tightening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through a clean cadence: gathering hush → prophecy’s counterbeat → the inverse word → ingestion. The pressure point (prophecy fighting back) forces a narrowing to a risky tactic with a visible, lasting price. Stakes are both intimate and communal (his body vs. the village’s dreams) and the resolution is earned. A hair more friction prior to the “period” utterance could heighten the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to listen and assume the keeper role—tightens through the interrogation of the gargoyle and the tutor’s vanishing. The cost (solitude, responsibility, polite erasures kept) is legible at the end. Escalation is gentle but distinct: meteors intensify, language clarifies, agency shifts to the narrator. It’s more deepening than reversal, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a quarantined memory—tightens as the resonance requires payment per syllable. The escalation is protagonist-driven, culminating in a visible price that reweights options. While opposition is systemic rather than personified, pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens. The public-archive turn credibly transforms the conflict’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release from vengeance—tightens as Mara chooses to bleed, write in her own script, reinterpret the key, and abandon the thorn. The escalation is internal but concrete, with a clear price: relinquishing identity built on calibrated treason. Pressure coheres toward a single decisive stance. No antagonist is needed; the conflict is credibly interwoven with objects and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (avoid becoming an unfinished echo) tightens as the canyon questions her and the mother’s voice appears, culminating in the farewell cadence. Escalation is agency‑driven; pressure coheres and deepens rather than multiplies. The cost—completing a goodbye that ends a lingering presence—reads clearly. Quiet but felt; no deus ex elements resolve it.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—recovering the pure thing before the glacier “digests” it—tightening when the glacier cracks and later begins to close. Escalation is primarily textural but legible: the windows seal, passengers dissolve, dawn dims starlight. The conflict resolves through endurance/attention rather than confrontation; while effective, the path is relatively smooth. The cost is present but gentle, keeping this just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on testing and embodying hidden effort, tightened when the moon veils and she persists, then sharpens into stepping off into shadow. The cost is conceptual and physical risk, reweighted by the new rule (absence as support). Escalation arises from her agency rather than coincidence. Pressure is lyrical but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens from search to discovery to the punishing playback, forcing a costly stance. The decisive act—suspending the diamond to broadcast to the soil—forecloses personal amnesia and triggers visible consequence (rot). Stakes remain coherent: truth versus preservation under radiation. Escalation is clean though largely internal, yet the physical world mirrors the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent (memory vs enforced forgetting) and pressure builds: the prophet’s miracle rewrites books, the electromagnetic “scream” spikes urgency, lightning hits the array, and she chooses to broadcast a counter-frequency. The tightening emerges from her agency rather than coincidence, even if lightning’s timing is mythic. The price is less a loss than a stance, reducing visceral bite. Still, escalation is clear and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—becoming a translator—tightens meaningfully when the child’s plea arrives, forcing Posy to risk her curated archive by opening the rusted box. The escalation is protagonist‑driven and culminates in a trade‑off: private custody of memory vs. communal becoming. Pressure deepens more than it reverses, apt for the chosen lens. The cost reads, though it could cut sharper on what is irretrievably lost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (protect Echo vs. save town) is signaled early and tightens at the calving moment. The reversal—inviting shadows to listen—arises from agency and prior setup (vibrational matching), not coincidence. The price is legible if quiet (tool degradation, ongoing duty), and tension runs at sentence and beat levels. Slight neatness in restoring order keeps it just shy of the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—timing a patient uprising—tightens steadily via measurable signals (three‑degree skew, 43‑second pulse, spiral keystone). The meaningful trade‑off is restraint under pressure; launching early is a live but foreclosed option. Consequences land in the communal response and infrastructural disruption; tension operates at sentence and scene scales without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. complicity under lingering control—tightens at the journal find and the personal connection. The pressure remains coherent, interweaving external investigation and internal triggers. The cost is quieter (moral/existential), but the narrowing from “empirical only” to “tell the carved story” reads as a meaningful trade‑off. A slightly sharper on‑page risk would elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: save what can be saved (song, possibly life) before dawn. Pressure tightens when Olya says she can give “beat” but not “mercy,” forcing Emil to escalate with the evidence and the newsroom plan. Costs (defying institutional inertia, spending the fund, accepting he’ll attend the execution) are visible. Escalation is measured rather than dramatic but remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (“ring the bell no one hears yet”) tightens with “Descend,” the missing clapper, and the realization of translation as the solution. Escalation is primarily textural and conceptual rather than adversarial; costs are present but not severe. The inventive tactic at the climax is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus self-erasure—tightens decisively at the firewall’s bargain. The choice to open “UNSEND” forecloses her corporate life with visible cost as her identity flickers out. Internal conflict (contract vs. conscience; duty vs. mother) interlocks with external pressure in one clean escalation. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence, and consequences persist (crowd-hosted memories, blank user cadence).

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (save Sira before the ice closes) is clear and tightens meaningfully with the crack below and the noose‑of‑seconds motif. Escalation arises from Kael’s agency (repurposing mirror, coordinating by angles, physical haul). Costs are legible (risk, injury, breaking a unique tool). The conflict intertwines external peril and the ethical calculus without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes cohere around how to meet approaching endings; escalation pivots on the horn and the boy sprinting for the ship. Mara’s agency tightens options: she chooses to intervene with the chime, then to renounce witnessing and the heirloom. The cost is quiet but legible and enduring. The piece remains gentle rather than tense, but the pressure still deepens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates quietly: solitude after the bus, the letter on the table, tasting the ’98, and the tomorrow‑graft resolve. Stakes are primarily internal—will he find a reason to stay that doesn’t read as penance—and they tighten via reinterpreting struggle as expression. The visible price is acceptance of loss and the commitment to risky “impossible” grafts. Escalation is modest but coherent for the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are simple and strong: preserve wisdom before it dissipates. Escalation comes via time pressure (dusk to dawn), the ritual’s progressive narrowing (perimeter thrice to periphery‑held consecration), and the pavilion’s thrumming alignment. The cost is subtle (restraint, exposure, endurance) but present; no hard reversal, though the clearing’s non‑physical manifestation is a meaningful deepening. Pressure remains coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on transforming pain into shared beauty; escalation is a density increase: photo handling → spiral → dove → witnesses. The “waiting for witnesses” beat is the key tightening, but the price isn’t sharply felt, and there’s no significant foreclosed option. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, landing quietly but effectively. One more tangible risk or loss would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (decode growth in a world beyond definition) is clear and deepens through the sequences and the library’s reply. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara testifies and the library answers, reweighting her goal into witnessing. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral; opposition is minimal, so pressure never truly pinches. The cadence shift suffices for this mode but stops short of acute risk.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes cohere around whether he can locate and hear the “frequency” before memory erases it. Tightening comes from arranging and following markers into thicker fog, culminating in pressing play and hearing the hum that reweights his quest. Cost is legible: the tape ends; forgetting will claim the moment; he chooses to mark what will vanish. Pressure is quiet but accumulates credibly under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—clinging to repair vs. restructuring self—tightens as tremors escalate and the spinning hand erodes certainty. The decisive act (loading the clock hand, timing by the leaf-sound, choosing to leave) narrows options with a visible cost: losing the observatory. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly. The cost carries into the final flight and static needle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: shepherding an intentional goodbye. Pressure tightens when Mara shifts from hymning the mundane to hymning the “scent of hope,” narrowing tactics as Calderon approaches stillness. The price lands on the page (death; Mara’s acceptance of carrying both halves forward). Resolution flows from Mara’s choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake (find/restore shadows) and tightens via the reversal of walking the Möbius interior and surrendering the key. Agency drives turns; coincidence does not resolve the conflict. The visible price—her surrendered wandering silhouette and the sealing of the loop—charges the resolution. A slightly sharper beat of risk or prospect of failure could heighten the midpoint stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to metabolize a grave misjudgment—tightens when the path appears and she confronts the changeling’s offer. The decisive gesture (inserting the tooth) forecloses the pursuit of former certainty in favor of a costlier ethic. Stakes are moral and internal rather than perilous, but consequences for identity and communal narrative are legible. A hair more antagonistic resistance might have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is consistent and escalates through one meaningful tightening—the weighing—which triggers the mirror’s transformation and the release of light. The emotional and conceptual cost is legible (surrendering the pearl; accepting dull sea glass). Pressure is primarily internal/ritualistic rather than adversarial, but it coheres and grows under this lens. No reliance on coincidence to resolve; the droplet complicates, the protagonist’s choices resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over her narrative—tightens with Elias’s arrival and his silent “proffer,” which forces a choice. The escalation is quiet but decisive: make a new statement, then renounce the algorithm by burying it. The cost is social and conceptual, legible in the refusal to upload and the locket‑like snap. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is explicit and embodied early (finish the novel/save livelihood), with a tightening when Lira confronts her (“You left me mid‑knock”). The choice to keep curio‑hopes vs let them rewrite her forecloses a path; the cost is surrendering control and the talisman’s function. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively; the cadence shifts into action (writing through dawn) rather than a soft reset. No coincidence resolves the problem; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early (cure and cultural restoration) and pressure coheres around a shrinking window. Escalation hinges on the exact lunar timing and the final choice to release at the boundary—a meaningful tightening with a visible price (the vine’s life transfers). No major reversal, but the cadence shift at the moon’s last sliver delivers. Stakes remain personal and communal without telescoping beyond the scene’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear early (finish the map before safekept light runs out) and escalate via depletion → failed waiting → deliberate spiral → star’s fall → last gap at the eastern border. The decisive deepening—recognizing relinquishment, not more light, is the price—reweights options credibly. Yet the climactic act is withheld by truncation, so the price is gestured at rather than paid on the page. Tension operates at line and beat levels, especially in the crater’s “held note.”

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (recovering time) tightens through investigative beats to a decisive reversal (silence fed into the mechanism). Escalation is primarily textural, but the knowledge deepening narrows options and culminates in a meaningful renunciation (locking wonder away). The cost is felt though quiet, aligning with the mode. Slightly low threat level mid‑piece keeps it from a higher tension band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (save the valley via the lattice) and tightens when the lamp sputters and silence grows heavy. Agency peaks in her confession, which exacts blood and forecloses avoidance. Internal conflict and environmental pressure interlock; the violet flare and unfolding space feel earned. Cost persists in what she leaves behind and in the scarred vulnerability she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to live with grief/memory) is signaled early and tightens as carving moves from blank to charged object. The meaningful turn is the acceptance pivot: from “keep the cage closed” to acknowledging memory as cage and key, enacted by hanging the latch and staging the carving for dawn. Cost is palpable in rust‑hued sawdust curls and the blood memory. Escalation is intentionally quiet; a slightly sharper mid‑scene test could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ownership of self/time—tightens steadily as payments escalate in cost. The crucial reversal is the blank frame bargain requiring the narrator to stay and watch; it leads directly to the identity swap. Each trade forecloses options and leaves scars (camera-shaped) that carry forward. The cost is unmistakable and persists beyond the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual (reconfigure a dead terminal into a refuge), and escalation is gentle: discovery → repurposing → signal. Agency drives each turn, but pressure lacks a sharp cost or live risk that forecloses options. The tightening is real (from private tinkering to public beacon), if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether she clings to or releases the ambition; the meaningful tightening happens when the tiles answer and the bear splits, forcing a choice. The cost is legible in renunciation and the transformation of her dream into a seed that outlives her. Escalation is quiet but decisive and driven by her agency. A touch more friction or competing pull at the moment of planting could heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus inherited myth—is signaled early and tightens through log-reading to the bunker reveal. A meaningful deepening occurs with the coordinate and the on-page recovery of journals, culminating in a renunciation that carries cost. Pressure is mostly internal but coheres and grows under the causal lens. Agency drives each turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (recover the storm‑corn method before authorities erase it) are active and tighten with the harbormaster’s approach. Ari’s decisive acts—completing the stanza, cracking the fulgurite bead, planting on the dock—foreclose alternatives and carry risk. The fog clock and brittle glass add constraint. Escalation remains coherent and culminates in an earned, high‑charge image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on release versus retention: each turn tightens via the thread’s diminishing length and the mounting apparitions. The reversal when her own younger self emerges is a clear deepening that narrows options, leading to the planting choice. Cost is the surrender of her instrument and identity; pressure remains internal but coherent under the chosen lens. Escalation is subtle yet undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (restore beauty) is signaled early and deepens as he assembles a heart “tender enough to break the schedule of rust.” The meaningful tightening arrives at the hatching and the aria’s refusal to be caged, forcing the trade‑off: beauty spreads while the palace falls. Agency drives escalation; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. Slight softness in direct antagonism is offset by the clear price and narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she transform inherited harm into growth—tightens as she moves from sand to coin to logbook to vow. Pressure is internal but escalates through embodied triggers (gull/courtroom, scar touch, Icarus recollection) and culminates in a costly stance. The earned stasis/charged poise is clear though the conflict remains quiet. Stakes remain legible and convergent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates as the breadcrumbs force successive confrontations with increasingly intimate failures, culminating in forgiveness and release. The dominant stake—freeing memories and accepting complicity—tightens meaningfully at the “Unkept Promises” fountain. The final act of opening the box and leaving it behind is an earned renunciation with felt cost. Slight softness: no hard external resistance; the tension is fully internal.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (break the generational loss pattern vs. become a bloom) is legible early and tightens with the anomalous echo. The choice to step off the path and interface gear with beacon is the meaningful turn; internal and external pressures braid effectively. Cost is subtler (renouncing rooted sorrow, leaving the heirloom) but present; the resolution is protagonist‑driven. Slight softness on explicit consequence prevents a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible early (“before the last butterflies leave”) and intensify as Elara reverses paths and externalizes grief’s shape. Escalation is a density/deepening rather than reversal, consistent with the chosen lens, and the cost is conceptual (abandoning a name for a communal spiral, accepting her own mortality). The avocado‑sap choice and timed tying of the ribbon are credible tightening moments. Pressure is steady rather than acute, but it coheres to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stakes are legible early (stop the clock and void contracts vs. keep it and let the sea eat), and the meaningful tightening arrives at “the space of one heartbeat.” The protagonist’s alteration forecloses the status quo while accepting new costs (maintenance, slower time, corrosion, communal re-tempoing). While mostly internal, tension threads sentence to sentence and resolves via committed action rather than coincidence. The villagers’ emergence provides an external echo of the internal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (unfolding the dead’s intention) is signaled early and tightens through the cipher and map to a consequential descent. Escalation is primarily discovery‑driven; resistance is low but the final lock supplies tangible cost. Agency drives each turn rather than coincidence solving pressure. A single complication or false lead could raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—authoring one future before dawn—tightens as each written stroke exacts a memory, narrowing options. The escalation is agency‑driven: she chooses listening over calculation, writes invisibly, and trades identity for possibility. The final renunciation (becoming the constraint) is an earned deepening that reweights options for others. Pressure remains coherent and internal/external threads interlock.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—smuggling story back under censorship—is evident and deepens through the solstice constraint and the inspectors’ sweep. The decisive intensification is Mila’s transmission, where risk peaks and options narrow. The cost is more conceptual than bodily, but danger and irreversible exposure are present. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular: whether grief can be made legible without completing the story. Escalation reads as deepening density (chair settling, mask fitted, powder widening into spirals) with the lighting shift intensifying pressure. The option foreclosed is the fantasy of a complete narrative; cost is acknowledged on the page. No large reversal, but one substantial tightening is present for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truthful remembrance versus civic denial—tightens through the discovery of the sump and the decision to etch and hide the lead sheet. The femur/cog act marks a meaningful deepening, and the public proclamation forecloses safety (social standing, possibly physical). Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist. A sharper on‑page jeopardy (e.g., interruption, guard, or time‑pressure beat) could lift the felt price further.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (unlearning hatred via subtractive harmony) tightens at the missing root beat, forcing the costly choice to relinquish her voice. Pressure builds coherently under the accumulative lens; the sacrifice is a clear narrowing of options. The rosette’s dissolution and her permanent silence underline consequence. A slightly greater sense of potential failure might have heightened urgency further.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seed the city with unauthorized memory—tightens through the live clock and the encroaching Ministry. Escalation is agency‑driven (planting to pruning to harvesting to distribution) with concrete prices (theft, blood, exposure). External opposition remains largely atmospheric until the end, slightly softening felt jeopardy. Still, the cadence shift at dawn and the Ministry’s arrival seal the pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens from idle booth to forbidden ascent to a lie that violates her defining constraint. The lie is a meaningful, costed act that narrows options and triggers the external cascade. Internal and external pressures interlock cleanly. Stakes remain focused without inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes concentrate around understanding and preventing a spread of sentient choreography; pressure intensifies via the house’s louder “breathing” and the decision to offer a pattern. The decisive ritual (self‑displacement, paper boat toward marble) narrows options and resolves the hum. Consequences are primarily conceptual/atmospheric rather than materially costly. Nonetheless, agency clearly drives the turn and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: risk revelation to transform a static city or preserve comfort. Escalation deepens through the approach to the keystone and the explicit reckoning with the court’s hypocrisy. Agency is decisive in the ampoule’s breaking; the cost is conceptual and social rather than physical but felt. Pressure remains coherent and tight to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—continuity of self via motion vs. confronting the missed door—is signaled early and tightened when the stairs slow at her realization. She actively raises costs (blood, sigma) and finally chooses to refuse the door and feed the dice into the ripple, foreclosing a path. The chipped die as “key” creates a decisive narrowing of options. The price (self’s erasure into forgetting) is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure accrues via pattern: insomnia → brush ignition → greenhouse thickening → communal breathing, with the moon’s rise/set narrowing the window. The key tightening is the discovery that the mural is for lungs, which reweights the stake from solitary making to civic memory. Costs are felt (exhaustion, surrender of ownership to the air), though no hard dilemma is forced. The escalation is consistent with the accumulative lens rather than reversal-led.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (craft survival vs utilitarian decree) is clear and escalates: theft → silence → signal → confrontation. Tightening is protagonist-led through an inventive tactic (lens-as-resonator) that reopens options. The Council’s retreat feels a touch easy, but the cost is not erased (partial return, ongoing pressure). The cadence shift to a living atelier reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (evade death/prophecy) is signaled early and tightened by each failed trick and the stone’s rising weight/radiance. Escalation is protagonist‑driven—tying on the stone, initiating the throw, and cutting the string foreclose options and risk self‑annihilation. The price is legible: loss of his singular gift and the stone’s burnout. Pressure remains coherent with no coincidence solving the core dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: enter → confront the booth → open the corridor → face fear → relinquish the talisman. The refusal to “unbosom” drives a tactical pivot to the dictionary’s paradox, a meaningful tightening. Price is paid via surrender of the advisor/clasp and acceptance of a reweighted self. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly without contrived reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—crossing the Doldrum Wall—tightens credibly: forecasted calm, arrival of stillness, then engineered sonic oar-strokes. Escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under the accumulative lens, with the key turn being the shift from striking objects to striking absence and enlisting communal pulse. Cost is mostly exertional and conceptual rather than sacrificial, but the narrowing of options reads. The final spiral rig is an earned deepening, not a deus ex device.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear early (city’s safety vs her need to chart/know) and escalate through concrete beats. The altered note is a decisive agency move that narrows options as the entire city veers toward the watchers. Cost appears in the upheaval and the reframed loss; the final pivot to turn back carries a charged refusal/deferral. A sharper on‑page trade‑off (e.g., risking more immediate harm) could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: retrieve a proof‑object versus power’s preference for noble lies. Escalation arrives via the watchman and a timing constraint, forcing a non‑confrontational, risky climb and leap that forecloses bureaucratic avenues. The price is more conceptual/social than physical, but the moment of choosing evasion over confrontation reads as a real narrowing of options. Tension is steady if not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure mounts through a deepening ritual: from a dissolved ink drop to papered fissures to writing on the stone itself. Stakes remain primarily internal and ethical; the permitted tide and engineers’ trust add situational tension without direct pushback. The cost is a quiet renunciation—choosing clandestine memory over pure duty—clear but not harrowingly tested. One explicit constraint forcing a trade‑off in the moment would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the lantern‑off choice, a decisive deepening under the accumulative lens. The water level, dying lantern, and power return form a quiet but coherent clock. Costs are primarily ideological; a sharper tangible risk or loss would elevate the felt price at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief—tightens through the ritual, with a meaningful price (moonstone destroyed, dream used up, her last spark spent). Pressure escalates texturally via density of imagery and the flock’s multiplication, culminating in release and loss. No antagonist, but internal/external pressures interweave well. The paradox stair adds a secondary cost that deepens rather than distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (transforming unused potential vs moral cost) tightens as he escalates from mapping to sabotage to self-sacrifice. Each turn extracts a price (geode fragments, ethical degradation, finally his life). The final jump is an earned, costly narrowing of options, not a coincidence. Internal conflict interweaves with external stakes without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: belonging via the chip/pilgrim. Pressure tightens at the lever pull, transforming abstract hope into an on‑page test. External opposition is near‑absent and the price is mostly conceptual, which lowers felt jeopardy despite a strong central turn. Still, the deepening from object to lived frequency is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she transmute or face guilt—is signaled early and escalates through a purposeful sequence: carving lies, the watch hand’s eerie tick, the failed self-grafting, then confession and relinquishment. The price is unmistakable: surrendering a talisman of accusation and naming the loss she has erased. Internal and external actions braid cleanly, with one meaningful tightening. Quiet but decisive, earned by her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free Seris without granting victory—is clear and tightens through the moon‑timed hush, the naming of fears, and the ritual casting of grievances. The refusal to sign (letting the document fail) forecloses a path with conceptual and political cost. While the escalation is more deepening than knife‑edge peril, it remains coherent under the accumulative lens. A touch more jeopardy or resistance could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure deepens via concrete beats: the wake causes injury, fog erases poles, charts warn of shoals, the channel looms. The decisive turn—rejecting the chart to follow the irregular light—narrows options with a credible risk. Stakes are primarily internal but mapped to external hazards, keeping tension alive. The ending’s cost is ongoing uncertainty rather than a solved problem.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (remain hollow vs fracture into empathy) tightens through the newspaper discovery and culminates in the bargain. The decisive escalation is his step into the lake, paying a price that narrows future options (responsibility over oblivion). Internal and external pressures interweave; the lake’s visions sharpen the ethical calculus. The resolution is earned by his agency and the visible cost he assumes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging the bond—tightens at the key turn: “one of us had to die into the other’s form.” Agency drives escalation (choosing the circle, summoning, resisting change until the necessary moment, then inhaling). The cost is visible and irreversible, with the phoenix’s scream heightening pressure. Resolution grows directly from the protagonist’s decision and pays off the earlier warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming and repricing lost time in grief—is announced early and tightens through the card reading and the voices’ timestamps. The reversal arrives when the saucer crack becomes an active force, striking her chest and forcing release; agency is present in her ritual choices. Costs are felt (letting the grief clasp unfasten without erasing love) and the options narrow toward speaking the name. Escalation remains coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early—open the locked dimension through joy—tightening through the constructed sail and the corridor’s test. Pressure escalates in an accumulative cadence rather than reversals; the “faces” moment is the key tightening. Resolution is driven by her agency, but obstacles yield with relative ease, slightly muting the felt price. Still, the stay/seed turn lands with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is the cost of surrender; pressure tightens with the synchronized pulse and the stepwise freeing of memories. The choice forecloses a path (keeping the preserved past) and exacts a price. Internal and external conflict braid cleanly. The escalation is gentle by design but nonetheless decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (spark a silent revolution) is signaled early and tightens through the interrupted generator scene. The Voss reversal forces a tactical pivot (false report) that narrows options and risks exposure. Stakes pay off in the barges’ release and the fort’s reconfiguration at dawn. The price is more implied than dramatized in flesh, but tension runs at sentence and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around the promise and the curse; escalation arrives when the star dust sings and the sequence begins to “write equations in light.” The tightening is a deepening rather than a reversal, culminating in his surrender of comprehension. Stakes remain largely interior and aesthetic, but the cost—relinquishing the goal he’s sworn to—reads. Slightly soft external resistance keeps tension mid‑high rather than peak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming and re‑mapping harm—tightens via the printing ritual and storm‑amplified exposure; the timer’s “ding” forecloses erasure as a path. The emissary plane’s sacrifice is a concrete price, and the acceptance (“develop them, not erase them”) narrows options. Escalation aligns with the accumulative lens: density/pressure increase toward a single stance. Cost is emotional and conceptual but felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (intellectual/ethical duel with institutional consequences) is signaled early and tightens through syllogism/counter and the coded shadow. A meaningful deepening occurs when Vela reframes the duel as harbor, forcing a price: Caelus’s vocal exposure and mutual renunciation of the duel. Stakes are slightly abstract but made concrete by the scar and public setting. Escalation is agency‑driven, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the library/avoid punishment while forging beauty—tightens when footsteps and flashlights force a public stance. Their decision to present “order” as cover is a credible reversal that narrows options and risks personal cost. Internal stakes (identity molt) interlock with external pressure. The ease of Rourke’s withdrawal trims the afterburn of consequence, keeping this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—remain in the endless rehearsal or face the real night—tightens through the projectionist’s offer and the film’s seductive loop. The requirement to trade a sound narrows options, and the ticking clock reintroduces price at the end. Escalation is internal but coherent; the final decision forecloses the refuge with felt cost. A slightly softer external consequence keeps it below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is crisply signaled: the ridge’s integrity vs. erosion by forgetting. Pressure tightens through the thunder clock and discovery of the monochrome fissure, then culminates in the memory-for-fact trade. Agency drives the turn (planting the seed, accepting the loss) and the tactic shift (weaving doubt). Consequences land physically (ridge holds) and personally (erasure of the mentor’s name).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are personal but tangible—he needs proof of apology’s color before he can return—and pressure tightens via the lace’s hidden map and the mist arrivals. Agency drives the turns: he chooses to bury the compass, depart, and publicly surrender. The cost is legible in the relinquishments and risk of return. Slightly low external opposition keeps peak tension muted, yet the accumulative lens holds.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual and philosophical, which is executed with rare precision. The dominant stake—Mara's attempt to frame catastrophe through dispassionate data—is established early and deepened effectively. The pressure intensifies not through external events but through an internal realization, the "kindled humility" that complicates her mission. This moment serves as a meaningful deepening, forcing a trade-off between her professional detachment and a newfound sense of awe, with the cost being a humbling of her own intellectual framework.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose after trauma—is established immediately and deepens effectively at the story's midpoint. The discovery at the campfire provides a meaningful escalation, shifting the conflict from personal survival to a larger question of witness and memory. The protagonist’s agency is absolute in the climax, where her renunciation of the path forward is a decisive choice with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story establishes a powerful existential stake and escalates it through a series of deepening discoveries rather than conventional reversals. Mara's agency drives every beat of this intensification, from entering the building to creating her masterpiece. The final re-framing of her tragedy as the catalyst for this new art form makes the resolution deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    The stakes—the eternal rest of countless souls—are established with cosmic weight, and the conflict feels both unique and elemental. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution; his ingenious use of memory and grief to create an "underwater conflagration" is a brilliant escalation. The final cost, his own perpetual service, is a perfect, poignant trade-off that feels both inevitable and deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless escalation of stakes, deepening the conflict from immediate physical hunger to the long-term struggle for cultural survival. The pressure from the sanctions is constant and forces tangible, costly adaptations, such as grinding saffron into ink, making the conflict feel both grand and granular.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—solve the equation of grief—tightens once: the mosaic opens only after precise alignment, narrowing options from endless search to measurable tending of seedlings. Cost is the unchanged absence of the master.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to be seen—escalates through each released voice; the tightening is the irreversible exposure of his cache. The cost is the forfeiture of his three-year anonymity, felt when the girl’s palm presses the boards. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: thresh meaning from ruin. Pressure tightens when Mara realizes the exchange is memory-for-meaning, not goods. Agency: she paints with rainwater, then relinquishes the canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)

    Dominant stake—can one exile hearten the city with absence itself—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened at every trade: valve for access, empty satchel for mouthpiece, future echo for present sound. Each transaction forecloses an easier option (silence, forgetting, personal keepsake) so pressure escalates under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mother’s name on the memorial—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when Cassidy dips the nib, trading her last honest memory. Escalation is causal: each sentence narrows options until granite becomes “negotiable vapor.” Visible price (lullaby erased) alters tactics—she can’t sing it to test if the ink still works. Coincidence (Rurik arriving early) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)

    Dominant stake—document extinction before sunrise—tightens via chemical timers and neural backup expiry. One meaningful deepening: the buried grain’s rose flush announces irreversible end, forcing the shutter.

    Dominant stake—preserve the river-origin truth before the Registry buries it—tightens when the radio demands coordinates and Maren instead transmits the living map.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Silas will repeat his father’s lie or author his own truth—tightens when each spoken sentence costs physical erasure of the path; the final choice to forgive yet not become silence forecloses the wolf-legacy with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—save the boy before the tumor is harvested—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened each time the bead pulses hotter.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break the lullaby or lose collective desire—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened by each untied knot.

    Dominant stake—preserve seed-memory vs. chaos—tightens when each seed pressed into soil costs body-heat. One decisive deepening: spiral’s shift from devourer to heartwood narrows options irrevocably. Cost is visceral (her warmth, her exclusion from the doorway).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Mara honor civic protocol or the mountain’s whisper?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each pressure dip. Agency is continuous: logging data, climbing corkscrew stair, splicing servo arm, pressing switch. The final bell toll forecloses annual siren use and carries a social cost (radio wonder, possible censure). One micro-turn suffices; escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is healing by witnessing fragility; pressure tightens nightly as reflections linger longer, forcing the janitor from sweeping to communion. A single meaningful escalation—the fleck vision—forecloses return to the prior numb routine. Cost (loss of lantern glow, exposure of the chest’s bruise) legible on page. Coincidental luck is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the ghosts’ memory—tightens when the fracture appears. Escalation is driven by Alden’s agency: he studies clues, accepts the child’s jar, then chooses to mend rather than flee. One decisive deepening: the dream reveals total loss if he fails. Cost is felt in the “weight Alden carried in his chest” and the irreversible vow that binds him forever.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: to rediscover what time feels like when numbers fail. Pressure tightens as each price tag offers a new texture of memory; the final trade narrows his options from collector to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and tightened through each gathered shard. The spiral’s dissolution is the single meaningful deepening that forecloses completion as a goal. Cost is felt in the poet’s relinquishment of finished form.

    The dominant stake—whether humanity’s longing is being weaponized—tightens as Mara deciphers the footprint compounds and the statue’s hollow resonance. One clear deepening: realizing the pilgrimage is a harvest, not a gift. The cost is intellectual rather than visceral, keeping it below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with vegetation—tightens through each fertilizing beat; the terns’ warning escalates pressure. Agency is ritual yet decisive; the cost is the unending itinerancy. One deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens when the riddle’s answer must be named to save the brother. One decisive deepening: the leaf’s revelation reweights the map from abstract to olfactory coordinates. Cost is the softening wax and the hound’s limp, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into reunion or remain forever haunted. Pressure tightens when the compass spins—first micro turn—then escalates through voice, maps, corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—amend one truth—signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when Vespers swaps bishop. Escalation driven by her agency; cost visible in Halcyon’s ascent and spire’s collapse. One meaningful deepening suffices for length. Coincidence (child arriving) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve small truths before the next king’s erasure—tightens when the gallery demands “Record us” and peaks as Mara and Kestrel trade gunfire for memory.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim or forever bury the talent for making homes—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each artifact (stone’s discontent, feather’s demand).

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each decoded move; the suicidal king sequence escalates the internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—refracting guilt to diffuse blame—tightens with each echoed syllable; the cost is made visceral when the spire cracks and Lira forfeits her solitary claim to the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—meaning versus survival—tightens with each snapped chain; agency is Lira’s deliberate press of the charm against the glass. Escalation is mechanical and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve what the wrecking ball will erase—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each beat: mirror erasure → shell preservation → relinquishment.

Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Outer objective—guide the first sail back—is shadowed by the inner vow to reach the drowned mother; the single tightening (warmer reaches colder) is sufficient under the lyric lens, yet the sail’s slow turn risks coincidence as navigator.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reverse migration to reclaim lost geography) escalates via each cryptic call, narrowing choices until protagonist pays with self-dissolution. Cost is visceral and irreversible, felt in the crumbling censer foot and sprouting flowers.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety versus involuntary truth—tightens with each storm. Agency is exercised in planting the eye, a decisive act that forecloses escape and redefines safety as communal absorption. Cost is legible: permanent self-exposure in exchange for refuge.

    Dominant stake—breaking the memory-debt cycle—is signaled early and escalates through each observed gap.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“how to preserve presence without killing it”—tightens through each beat until the decisive release. Escalation is textural: density of regret accumulates until the shell’s re-breathing reconfigures options. No reversals needed; deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to chronicle when the dreamer is also the dream—tightens via the scroll’s instruction not to land.

No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to understand what clocks really measure”—is signaled early and tightens through each hydraulic anomaly. One meaningful deepening occurs when Torvald traces the anomaly to his prophetic dream, narrowing options to reversal or surrender.

    Dominant stake—recover Luc or accept loss—tightens with each fold discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mara convert her father’s posthumous riddles into an honest reckoning with probability and grief? Pressure tightens once: the final riddle (“Traverse where the index omits itself”) forces the literal track walk and the symbolic descent.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether the operator will break his loop of estrangement—tightens decisively when the woman invites him to step onto the rail.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief under silence ordinance—tightens via escalating risk: first the hidden microphone, then the crow’s demand, finally the officer’s presence.

    Dominant stake—whether prophecy ends in narrowing or reassembly—is signaled in the cracked bulb and escalates as each button re-threads a life.

    Dominant stake—“confess or remain unseen”—tightens when the mirror refuses frozen silence. Escalation is one deepening: the gyre stills, silver surface demands spoken truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant—tightens through each beat: clipping → maze → gardener’s question → tending the flower.

One deepening suffices and lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—trading memory for soul-repair—is signaled early and tightened when the mother’s hum is exacted. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible in Lira’s hollowed eyes and the orchard’s unbalanced ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she withstand mockery and still matter—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the chat explodes with laughing emojis. The middle deepening occurs as the crusher’s clang forces arena flashbacks, narrowing her options to flee or re-engage. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she offers the workshop, paying with unpaid labor. Cost is legible—she trades billable inventory hours for uncertain redemption—but the escalation is single-note, keeping it just shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing severed meaning—tightens via each cuneiform micro-glyph and the seed’s pulse. Agency is exercised in the planting and the equation etched into the leaf; the cost is the irreversible transformation of the seed into a bridge she must walk alone. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder without caging identity—tightens when moon pulls contradictions outward; smelting identities into ribbon is the decisive act that forecloses easy separation, paid for by her own looming erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—dissolving walls between hearts—tightens through each confession absorbed; the pearl’s warming and the crown’s bite mark escalating cost.

Pressure culminates in the mirror’s rippling reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens once: the paper boat is the single irrevocable act that ends the mapping compulsion. Pressure grows via the accordion’s wheeze and the graffiti’s echo, culminating in the visible cost of abandoning chemical amnesia. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict is sufficient and escalates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dream vs empire—tightens when fracture in destiny map forces a single irreversible stance. Escalation is driven by her agency: reading coffee, pressing thumb, singing off-key. Cost is visible—garden’s voice may survive, she does not. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—tightens through ritual action; the deepening occurs when she realizes the spark is her own. Cost is felt in her dissolution; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—contentment’s source—tightens when cloudwater shows her future descent; the vision forecloses escape and forces the downward choice. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each spiral image (moth, shell, hairpin) intensifies the cost of forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—absorbing guilt vs. enabling destruction—tightens when Mira refuses to launder the researchers’ certainty. The brass bell’s cracked note forces the final stance crystallization. Cost is visible: she leaves unpaid, shard filled with grief.

    Dominant stake: Marcus must learn the final lesson before Elara vanishes completely. Escalation tightens as each ring reveals deeper stakes—her past, the equations, his future, the true secret.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the wandering pulse—tightens once, when the towers answer his song. The pressure is coherent, but the cost is more metaphysical than tangible, keeping it just under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—desire for one unprogrammed sacred moment—is signaled early and tightened by the curfew subroutines that shrink the doorway.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—escalates from curiosity to life-risking immersion. The tightening occurs when Jin realizes the sound has been painting him; this reframes the risk as reciprocal. Cost is visible: he surfaces alone, archive sealed, bearing only the plankton echo. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely delivers the key.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—wavelength alignment before the final pulse—tightens through each coin’s dissolution. Agency drives escalation; the last quarter’s scream forces the decisive stance crystallization. Cost is legible: her atoms shed memory as price.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—naming the fear that shadows every reaping—tightens when the sky demands “What was sacrificed for you?” The reaper’s agency drives the reversal: shattering cylinders, releasing voices, accepting the cost of centuries of stolen life.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the vanished ocean—tightens via the accelerating drip rate and Kael’s bodily sacrifice. Each doubling of drops narrows options: he must stay forever or lose the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to steward memory of the drowned town—tightens via each photograph. The Polaroid of her father with another woman forces a choice: expunge or reframe. Cost is legible when she trades private pain for communal narrative. One beat shy of a deeper physical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove logic and reverence can coexist—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. Agency is continuous: reading starling patterns, drawing chalk circle, dissolving crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve network vs preserve trust—tightens once the glider flashes her stolen signal. Agency drives escalation: she descends, offers the buckle, releases the post.

No external antagonist needed; pressure tightens under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—faces a single decisive tightening: the impossible giggle in the tunnel forces Ellery to accept echo over resurrection.

No coincidence resolves; wind and concrete merely amplify what Ellery risks.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through intensifying sensory distortion and the glowing thread, but agency is more contemplative than tactical; cost is conceptual rather than visibly paid.

No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—holding the council accountable—tightens when the letter becomes a viral indictment.

The final downpour is earned pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: wrest meaning from silence. Escalation is textural—each metallic note tightens the hush until the halo forces a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens once: the realization that she surrendered them forces a final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—refuse forgetting yet save the library—tightens when the leaves predict her own binding; the cost is felt in the spit of “combative tenderness” and the backward sealing of exile clauses. One meaningful deepening suffices; agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to let go without betrayal—tightens through each measurement of forgetting. The meaningful deepening is Mara’s decision to release the plane and the dog tags; the cost is the irrevocable dispersal of grief into background hum.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—articulate needs before erasure—tightens via thunder countdown; each glyph reduces her hoarded reserve, visible price. The echo-touch reversal converts private archive into public moth-signal, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but pressure legible under chosen lens. Cost persists: plate rattles empty against spine.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she deliver the seed or report upstairs?—is signaled when she straps the goggles on. Mid-story tightening: the gust re-sorts pages, clicking the diary lock shut unless she acts now. Cost is legible: she trades thimble, risks dismissal, buries herself in sub-zero basement. One minor slack: the piano chord complicates mood but not tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—memorialize cloud-emotions before the cable snaps—is signaled in the first paragraph and escalates as each strand pops.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory of sky before erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each countdown siren.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the dying ship—tightens through Lira’s agency; each beat narrows options from wandering to deciphering to performing the story.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mend the cosmic/metaphorical lock and his own heart—tightens when no gear fits until the mirror collaboration offers a single path.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—restoring the lost song between iron and wood—tightens when the elevator threatens “let me rot,” forcing Mireya’s linguistic bridge-building; the cost is her dawn exhaustion and the irreversible porosity she creates.

    Dominant stake—extract intact dreams without self-loss—is signaled early and tightened by each milliradian adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore song before silence calcifies—tightens via each strum that widens cracks and risks the statue’s fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to redeem a life ruined by teaching truth—is signaled early and tightens when he realizes the “window to act” before the next phase.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: understanding failure’s cost. Pressure tightens when markers rearrange into spiral, forcing stance crystallization. Agency is renunciation; cost is flute and identity. No coincidence resolves; escalation is internal and mirrored in widening seam.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“discover the weight of a withheld truth”—escalates through each bay until the lover’s locker delivers the crushing payload.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether shadow can birth dawn without erasing stars—is signaled early and tightened each laugh. Each escalation (lens turns, sail billows, wick shortens) is driven by Lirael’s agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with visible cost (stars thinning, wick vanishing). One decisive tightening suffices at this length; the final choice to laugh again forecloses return to the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost candor—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the map warns “Speak true or the path closes.” Each junction question raises the cost of dishonesty, culminating in the mailbox’s humid breath that makes withheld words physically present.

The final price is conceptual yet legible: she gains access to a practice that will expose her to truths she can no longer claim were erased by drought.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightened by the comet’s once-in-seventy-six-years arrival. Agency is calibration, renunciation, and final gift; cost is the ice’s loss and her permanent silence. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence must defeat encoded prophecy—is signaled early and tightened through each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—learning to hear buildings—tightens when the tutor demands the narrator “listen until the limestone spoke,” forcing a decisive stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the quarantined memory—is signaled early and escalates through each beat: shell’s whisper, gate’s song, pond’s replay.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Mara can forgive herself and end the chain of vengeance—is signaled early and tightened by each recalled betrayal. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses her own shaky script over perfected forgery, foreclosing the path of continued treason.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“ensure her own life would not become a hollow vibration”—tightens when the canyon itself questions her. One decisive escalation: the cocoon of her mother’s unfinished departure forces the choice to complete the farewell. Agency is hers alone; luck merely reveals, never rescues. Cost is the irreversible silence she now carries out of the gorge.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—salvage something pure—tightens through each descent: shrine cracks, corridor narrows, passengers sing. One meaningful deepening: the intact globe demands she become its future teacher, foreclosing solo anonymity. Cost is felt in the glacier’s closing throat and the glittering dissolution of the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—revealing hidden patterns—tightens through each whisk stroke and firefly constellation; the final shadow path narrows options to a single act of trust.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—excavate truth at personal cost—tightens when the diamond’s playback forces inventory of her own lies. One decisive turn: she chooses to broadcast rather than possess, narrowing her future to exile under screaming Geiger. Cost is visible in the orchard’s accelerated rot and her copper-mouth shame. No escalation slack.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten from solitary exile to cosmic memory-keeper as the prophet’s rise accelerates.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory before it dissolves—escalates through each bottled sound; the child’s request tightens the pressure, forcing Posy to risk the box’s silence; the cost is felt when the box seals without playing a tune, trading melody for collective resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—nightmares solidifying without the Echo’s frequency—is signaled early and tightened by calving ice and advancing shadows. Mireya’s agency drives the third-path solution; the cost (marina’s near-destruction, key’s eroded teeth) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—timing the revolution—tightens through magnetic pulse and moon-path skew; one meaningful deepening at the spiral’s eye narrows options to a single instant. Agency is Elian’s decision to wait; cost is the irreversible blackout and his forfeited compass.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether complicity can be redeemed without death—escalates through each artifact discovered. The deepening occurs when Mara realizes her father’s unseen complicity, forcing a crystallized stance. Agency is hers; cost is the inherited guilt she now chooses to carry publicly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver Rowan a final lullaby—tightens when Olya warns the repaired song may indict Emil. The investigative pivot escalates via agency: he forfeits clerical safety for whistle-blowing. Cost is tangible: candle fund spent, dawn walk toward gurney unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“ring the bell no one hears yet”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when coordinates lock on the buoy.

Cost is visible on the dulled tip and unheard frequency in her ears.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Central stake (uncover erased Aurora passengers) is signaled by line 3 and escalates through each beat—#Aurora73 query → file bargain → memory upload → global broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Sira’s life—signaled in the mirror vision by word 120. Escalation tightens once: shard burn → rescue race → ice slam, all driven by Kael’s agency. Cost is visceral (frozen palms, treaty net). No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates the shifting floe.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to witness endings—tightens when Mara refuses to record final words and instead offers tea, narrowing her options. Escalation is driven by her agency: each act (volunteering, handing over parasol, serving tea) raises the cost of remaining passive. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the boy’s recognition is seeded by heirloom history. Price is felt: she loses relic and original purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—why stay?—tightens through the accumulating seasons and the single glass of ’98. No external antagonist is needed; the vineyard itself applies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens through the three ceremonial laps.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can communal pain be transmuted into shared beauty—escalates as each photograph narrows options toward the final spiral. Cost is felt in the grandchildren’s astonished laughter and the town’s collective exhale, a social price paid in exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding growth in a post-dictionary silence—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through accumulating sonic fragments, forcing Elara from passive decoding to active testimony; the cost is conceptual (loss of scholarly detachment) rather than viscerally enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging—tightens when the tape’s backward-spool frequency is heard. Escalation is textural: each chalk mark and driftwood arrow increases density until the cassette delivers the hum. Cost is felt: tomorrow’s amnesia already priced into today’s clarity. Agency is renunciation rather than action, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“to harness the ephemeral”—is present from the leaf vignette onward and tightens into a single irrevocable choice: let the image take everything or stay. Escalation comes as the building literally folds itself into film; visible price prevents reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“a flawless goodbye”—tightens through sensory accumulation; each mundane sound narrows options until silence. Agency rests in Mara’s renunciation of repair; the cost is the irreversible stillness on the monitor.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest starlight to finish heartbeat-map—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens as the last vial dwindles. Escalation is accumulative: each discarded object offers memory-fuel, narrowing options until only relinquishment remains.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring stolen time—escalates from rumor to Ansel’s body receiving “precise weight of a second” on his ribs. Tightening occurs when reverse assembly forecloses every other future except surrendering wonder to cellar darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—valley collapse—signaled early; pressure tightens when silence grows heavy and lamp sputters, forcing the sister confession.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)

    Dominant stake—making peace with abandoned dream—tightens once when Elara releases it. Cost is felt in the splitting bear and the seed left behind. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the storm-corn method—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the last tide-weaver dies. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded knot raises the cost of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform absence into presence—tightens as each inch of thread shortens; pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase. Final planting forecloses her role as obituary writer with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens through each lyrical accumulation; the ribbon’s escape forecloses the prince’s safety. Pressure grows via textured density rather than causal turns. The fall itself is the visible price. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the prince’s smile crystallizes stance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can scars sing instead of scream?—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened by the graft’s completion and the coin’s tether.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—liberation of trapped memories—tightens as each fountain dissolves a shard, narrowing Mara’s options from skeptic observer to vulnerable daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens when the echo returns sharper, forcing Kael off-path; the deepening is the discovery of the buried beacon, which reframes exile as transmission and costs the inherited gear.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—shape collective grief before butterflies depart—is signaled early and tightened by each reversed footstep.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—shared balance between land, sea, and debt—is signaled early and tightened by the pendulum pause. The protagonist’s agency (carving, lashing, winding) forces the trade-off; the sea’s retreat is incremental, not coincidental. Cost is visible: time slackens, villagers’ heartbeats slow. One beat shy of 9+ only because the external antagonist (sea/ridge) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—will Mercy discover what the dead intend before dawn pruning?—escalates as each decoded knot narrows her options. The spiral cipher and map raise the cost of ignorance, forcing her to trade surface freedom for custodianship. Agency is hers: she chooses to dig at the lamb’s feet and descend. A slightly abstract “wager memory” keeps the pressure from being fully visceral, hence not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—only one future can be written before dawn—tightens with each memory surrendered. Escalation is accumulative: every stroke of the invisible pen forecloses a past and narrows possibility. The cost is visceral (blueing fingertip, dissolving body) and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—smuggle narrative back into the world—tightens when the broadcaster announces the solstice deadline. Agency: Mila’s decision to amplify dust narrows her options irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“to unlearn hatred across the hours between the last leaf falling and the first frost”—is signaled early and tightened when the braid lacks a root tone. Agency is renunciation: Mara offers her voice as sacrifice, a choice that narrows her future to permanent silence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rewiring collective memory versus Ministry control—tightens once: the seed sprouts, aromas infiltrate sleep, officers drop torches. Escalation is driven by Marisol’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the blood she feeds the plant and her future risk.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—tightens when the hive’s failure threatens to erase it; the lightning bolt forces Mara to wager her post for wonder’s survival.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cottage’s loneliness—escalates through tactile displacement rituals; the tightening occurs when Mireille offers motion the house can mimic, foreclosing her observer stance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve the city’s certainties or release nuanced memory—is signaled early and tightened through each micro-awakening. The decisive act of cracking the ampoule narrows options irreversibly. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the statue’s own stone identity. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightened when the dice balance on the missing corner. One meaningful deepening: the staircase slows, forcing her to choose between stasis and continued climbing. Agency drives the rupture; luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the perpetual climb itself and the blood she pays to keep it moving.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finish the mural before dawn—tightens as moonlight wanes and the brush glows with sound. One decisive intensification: the mural’s purpose shifts from private compulsion to communal gift, paid with Mira’s spent wakefulness and Jules’s shared breath.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the crafts be forgotten?”—tightens through each beat: silence, Milo’s news, Council decree, final chord.

One meaningful escalation suffices; no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single stake—escape pre-dawn death—tightens with every failed trick; the cost escalates from loosened bricks to lost gift, culminating in a decisive trade-off legible under causal lens.

    Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing weakness—tightens through each mirror encounter until the only option left is to forgive the child-self.

Could edge higher if the external stakes (ambulance, collapse) were more viscerally present.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—raft must escape Doldrum Wall—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of rhythms increases until silence becomes groove.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—city’s survival versus personal need for truth—tightens once when the whistle’s cracked note forces the turtles north; cost is legible in merchants’ screams and her dropped whistle, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned myth—tightens when the letter’s beauty seduces her, forcing a visible price (the leap, the nettle roll).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can the lovers’ rotunda be saved?”—is reframed into “can memory be saved?” as each fissure becomes a burial site for abandoned dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into cranes—tightens once: the moonstone cracks, forcing the maker to inhale the dream at the cost of her own last dream. Agency is crystallized in the folding; the price is the moonstone’s obliteration and the permanent exile of her private memory into public light.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harvesting unlived futures to avert further deaths—is signaled early and tightens once: the realization he’s “death’s accountant” forces the dive. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; each hunt costs geode dust and narrows options. The visible price (loss of self, literal fall) is legible on the page. Slight over-intensity in phrasing (“bleak exhilaration” twice) but pressure never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where you belong”—tightens when the matrix chip’s stars sing her name, foreclosing further wandering. Pressure escalates via the pilgrim’s invitation to pull the lever; agency crystallizes in that single action. Cost is conceptual: the safety of endless seeking ends.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can guilt be offloaded?—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens through each beat: every carved lie increases the void’s mass.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stake is clear—restore self-trust while risking the unknown. Escalation progresses as safer harbor fades, compass fails, water invades suit, shoals threat rises. Each decision (steering off-chart, renouncing maps) narrows options under visible risk. No coincidence resolves; dolphins bless rather than rescue, so agency remains hers. Cost is on-page: the final “widening yes” carries acceptance of limitless exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—empathy vs. erasure—signals in line 1 and tightens at each fork: left/right/straight becomes wade/retreat. The lake’s bargain is the single meaningful deepening that reweights cost; no coincidence required. Agency remains with the seeker throughout; persistent constraint (shared pain circulating under skin) shapes the final letters. Price is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether surrendering memories can transmute poverty into generative power—tightens with each freed firefly. Agency is continuous: she chooses release, each act narrowing her physical existence while widening her conduit capacity. Cost is felt as literal dissolution. Coincidence (planets, volcano) complicates rather than rescues. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—silent revolution—tightens when blackout turns from obstacle to ally. Each beat (quill bridge, valve bleed, timer set) raises cost: Garnet’s identity, Luce’s exposure, Voss’s authority. Final slackening of chains is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise to Mira—tightens when Elias realizes the only way to keep it is to stop trying to understand.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether waiting is still a form of playing—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightened when the departure board settles on “Onward.” Escalation is driven by her agency: ascending the ladder, trading the chime, choosing to leave the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—ridge collapse—escalates through a single decisive tightening: the monochrome canyon widens unless doubt is woven. The price (loss of mentor’s name) is visible on the page and alters Calyx’s future tactics, satisfying the closure cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "translator’s instinct overriding vertigo" forces step-through, narrowing options to keep/release fragment. Cost unmistakable in "absence weighs more," reconfiguring light from object to shared burden. Single dominant stake (fragment’s ownership) deepens via "intuition is not a compass but a tide."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via Mara's agency: analyzing dust patterns leads to climbing the ladder, narrowing options to one vertical path. Cost is unmistakable in her physical/emotional shift ("weightless burden transferred to the mainspring") under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Corwin's agency: bottled whisper release causes immediate system collapse (cracked apples, sliding books). Cost legible in reality's renegotiation, though "sky noticing" warning lacks tangible escalation prior to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the mirror reveals Mnemosyne's future collapse, forcing Aurelio's inscription as a trade-off between despair and legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the guild dispute's resolution lacks felt consequence beyond the central pair's epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (finding where explanations fail) tightens via compass visions, but lagoon’s "tribute" demand lacks visceral escalation. Cost—sacrificing collection identity—is legible yet under-pressured; one deepening (vial release) suffices but feels slightly detached from physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: slide's projection forces Maela to reinterpret "escape as arrival," culminating in GPS sacrifice. Cost legible ("left it drowned"), but "timewoven alliances" concept lacks tactical friction during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.5)
    Single dominant stake (truth vs. self-preservation) tightens relentlessly through Mireya's agency: each traded future fragment forecloses paths. Cost is visceral in "years rearrange inside me" and the lagoon's stillness after decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Veyra’s agency: her rejection of the bottle’s "false comfort" culminates in smashing it, foreclosing magical solutions. The accumulative escalation (scavenging fragments → mandala → scent) reweights the dominant stake with unmistakable cost—the bottle’s destruction yields only rain-scent, yet it summons the first exile.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Ambrose's agency: his decision to archive the prophecy forces renunciation of silence, narrowing options to becoming the city's living archive. Cost is palpable in the orchard's transmutation, though escalation leans slightly heavy on lyrical accumulation over causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: scattering seeds and exhaling warmth directly alter entropy mechanics, narrowing options to "decreasing entropy by surrendering heat." Cost is unmistakable—"role was to remain" as archivist—under accumulative lens where each seed placement reweights inheritance debt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    Pressure tightens via microclimate anomalies (pressure dips, wind shifts) under Accumulative lens; Mara’s agency in switching the toggle forecloses prediction for "courtesy," with cost legible in her altered stance: "she would listen."

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (is vulnerability strength?) tightens accumulatively through nightly empathizing until Perseids climax. Cost is unmistakable in "strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere," with protagonist agency driving every beat toward the mirror arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Alden’s agency: the propagating fracture forces the binary choice (mend/leave), tightening options via accumulated word-weight. Cost is visceral ("pressure equal to desert’s heat pressing against ribs") but slightly abstracted in the final resolution’s hopeful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (rediscovering time's texture) tightens through the price-tag discoveries and culminates in the shiver trade's cost. Agency-driven escalation: timekeeper's decision to descend and engage shifts from observation to embodied exchange, narrowing options to sensory commerce.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: horizon "wounded" by storm tightens to the chord's tension, with cost legible in the poet's sufficiency ("not finished but sufficient"). Agency is attention, foreclosing completion with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake ("foster interspecies respect before cells collapse") tightens through biological escalation: each species’ integration (sparrow’s song, gecko’s light) narrows Mateo’s time while deepening collaboration. Cost is visceral when his pulse synchronizes with the orchard’s chord—agency drives every turn (hemp sleeve, alternate paths) under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (human autonomy vs. harvested longing) tightens through Mara's discoveries, but escalation lacks visible price—visitor threat remains conceptual rather than altering tactics with concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten through Scraps’ agency: her scent-to-syntax translation directly solves the riddle, narrowing options to the brother’s coordinates; the cost—her identity shift—is visible in “limping slightly ahead” while the leaf’s warmth against Kite’s skin embodies earned closeness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully via bishop swap—Vespers' agency alters board physics to force Halcyon's choice. Cost legible in "knuckles white on parapet" and melting forgiveness runes. Sky's "wrong" timeframe could heighten urgency earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation under accumulative lens: Kestrel’s intrusion narrows Mara’s options (trust or flee), forcing the "Adel" spelling with visible cost—the rifle’s muzzle on the pawn’s square. Dominant stake (memory vs. silence) deepens via protagonist’s agency in micro-choices, not empty intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single stake (reclaiming talent without self-destruction) tightens through deepening: war trauma narrows options until feather forces irreversible choice. Cost crystallizes in stone's dust and skin's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes signaled immediately: "winnow guilt from memory." Escalation via Marek’s agency—decoding the suicidal king sequence reveals forgiveness requires reframing, not solving. Cost legible in "thunder finally rolled," translating emotional release into sensory consequence. Single tightening (labyrinth as mirror realization) forecloses the "solve" path under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Ren’s agency: turning inland, entering cleft, copying the shell. Cost is legible in "fatigue blurred form" and the irreversible act of leaving the canvas-shell. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but lacks visible trade-off beyond time/energy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (whispers vs shouts) tightens through keeper's agency: heat wave's end creates live clock for scent transmission; visible cost is lifelong transmission of unsaid words, narrowing options to "one purified intention at a time".

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via cryptic phone calls drives protagonist agency ("she obeyed, burning fingertips"), narrowing options until dissolution; cost is unmistakable as "weight left her" during the offering, with moon-phase mechanics creating visible tradeoffs in timing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.6)
    Dominant stake (safety vs. truth) tightens when discarding the eye risks harming others, forcing deeper ravine descent. Protagonist agency drives escalation (planting eye), with cost legible in "I did not apologize" and enduring the orchard's truth-system.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via three gaps deepens the dominant stake (memory debt) under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable as alpine sun fragments take maternal memories—felt through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single stake ("step or not?") tightens via rising creek water forcing immediacy; ants' path disappearance creates earned reversal. Cost undeniable in "slow accretion of days like sediment" as he witnesses his own endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by queen’s agency: her realization that dreams are future memories ("knot tied by future desperation") narrows options to one irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Corin's confession ("selling absence") and the crushing act, narrowing options with visible cost (livelihood abandonment); agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though "secret-whispered" timeframe lacks tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when Mira shifts from analyzing the screw to repositioning it—a meaningful choice that forecloses passive observation. Cost is visceral (tears, "hollow nose"), but escalation leans slightly on Horace’s absence rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the "panic" metaphor risks abstracting the concrete birth trauma it references.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (rewriting grief vs. lethal breath) tighten through Lina’s agency: holding breath past crystallization for the twelfth stroke. Escalation via Accumulative lens—steam plume thickening, lightning strike—narrows options to the final stroke. Cost is legible: quill fracture, brother’s name spoken "lighter than the last" into the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through the orchard’s looming bulldozing, but Julian’s "public domain" revelation lacks sufficient escalation pressure; the apology’s fading feels more lyrical than causally constrained by the timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (unraveling illusions) tightens via dictionary's evolution, but pressure escalates abstractly until late concrete cost (name erasure). Spiral arbitration rules deepen stakes effectively, though "cosmic illusions" framing lacks embodied immediacy until final dictionary transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation through density increase perfectly executes under Accumulative lens: each perception shift (uphill water, horizon dissolution) narrows options while deepening the time-reversal concept. Cost—loss of linear time understanding—is made legible in the dissolution image with crystallized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Maya realizes "no original, no copy," forcing the merge choice. Escalation is driven by her agency (laser-dot pathing), but Dr. Voss's exposition slightly dilutes the pressure build; cost is legible in "relinquished grief" yet lacks a concrete tactical price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: interpreting wet ink ("traverse where index omits itself") drives her into the tunnel. Cost is visible in her "clover melancholy" realization that forgiveness requires facing probability's failures, narrowing her path from hunting contradictions to creating them.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten texturally through the child's escalating requests ("Teach me how endings begin"), narrowing options until the gate opens. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with visible cost: disc handover sacrifices his only emotional anchor. Minor slip: adult reveal slightly dilutes the cost’s immediacy despite "I was the kid" justification.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through proximate causes: loose board → security headlights, narrowing options until locket sacrifice. Cost legible in "steep absence like a clean nail wound" foreclosing preservation-as-keeping.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: the "metallic, like moon rock" line crystallizes loneliness's cost, while the reciprocity constraint narrows options to finding a partner. Protagonist agency drives the catalysis choice, with visible cost in Lila's "hollow" filling and the boy's softened shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (mapping unmapped emotions) tightens through the spiral’s intensifying notes, but escalation lacks a concrete mid-scene trade-off; cost ("memorizing topography") feels earned yet the forest’s "tightening walls" remain atmospheric rather than actively raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake ("confidently uncertain" interpretation) tightens through pen vibration and gravity slackening; Mira’s agency in renaming filaments narrows options. Cost remains conceptual (eternal uncertainty) but lacks visceral weight in closure image despite "trembling" voice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency: mapping gaps → conducting harbor. Cost unmistakable in soundless crying and empty camera. One tightening (disruption → full orchestration) suffices; advisor’s "first note" deepens stake without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (truth vs corrupted history) tightens meaningfully when sketches form maps, narrowing options through protagonist agency. Cost in the archive's collapse charges the final image, yet escalation lacks tangible tactical trade-offs—Ember's journey remains curiously frictionless despite high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through textural escalation (ripples→crescendo→dissolution), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt; Mara's physical dissolution isn't embodied with specific consequence. Agency-driven pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through storm's intensifying interference: GPS failure forces reliance on sound, narrowing options to whispered sequence. Cost is Mira's worldview collapse foreclosing her mapping authority.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as she presses the humming mirror to her chest, transforming darkness from "hungry" to "full of borrowed starlight," but the abstract conflict lacks one visceral tactical cost during the dance sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (rigid rules vs. second thoughts) escalates through Mara’s agency: window displays narrow options under curfew risk, culminating in autonomous pieces.

Pressure coheres under accumulative lens; "amplified quiet" tightens decisions without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: "detaching" forecloses duty path with felt cost (island "erased from maps"). Whale’s call deepens knowledge, but council’s arrival lacks sufficient pressure escalation for 9.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through the poet’s escalating paraphrases ("None shall pass" → "None shall stay"), with visceral cost in the freezing risk, but the abstract "boundary law" lacks concrete relational urgency beyond systemic opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.7)
    Escalation hinges on Milo’s agency: his vision of "violence of color" drives the deliberate vase-smashing, narrowing options to embrace brokenness. The dominant stake (beauty in imperfection) tightens through his rejection of "perfect" hues, with the visceral cost of destroying their joint creations charging the spiral garden’s final arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's questioning narrows options effectively, but the conceptual cost (shifting from preservation to creation) feels underweight compared to physical stakes required for higher bands; no tangible forfeiture beyond mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully around "preservation vs celebration," but rock-bottom backstory lacks live-clock pressure; cost is felt ("grief transforms us into something new") yet agency in escalation feels passive.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (mapping cultural patterns before forgetting) tightens meaningfully when the leveraged debt sigil recurs, but escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist agency; cost is conceptual yet slightly detached from embodied consequence in the peak discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation (nostalgia's physical cost), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the "avoiding patterns" method feels asserted rather than earned through visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake tightening via shedding layers forecloses path (immaculate reputation); cost visible in dead lizards and pride loss. Agency-driven escalation lacks one visceral pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single dominant stake (releasing miracle requires fresh loss) tightens through protagonist agency: unwrapping gauze, blood offering. Cost is visceral and unmistakable—"blood dripped" as "syllable of apology." "Trade requires fresh loss" dialogue avoids thematic echo by serving plot logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Mara's agency—scratching new lyrics forces a trade-off (releasing love vs. hoarding it). Cost is unmistakable: the blank letter gains words but transforms into film threading her chest, altering her tactics as she leaves with ashes and reel.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (creativity's survival) tightens through meteor syllables to "create, or perish," with dissolution as visible cost. Escalation slightly passive—the aurora delivers the warning rather than protagonist driving discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving children's dreams) signaled early; escalation via density increase as "probability clouds condense" into tangible hands. Cost is conceptual (forest/time irrecoverable) but felt in "unlit corner" where futures crouch—visible through cargo's wave-travel pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake tightening peaks when jaguar demands she "give away the thing that keeps you rooted," narrowing options to surrender or stagnation. Cost legible in "last faithful flake of her original mind," though "forest’s engines coughed" slightly relies on environmental coincidence rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes remain abstract despite strong setup; no visible price paid during search. "Unused courage" concept lacks visceral escalation though internal/external conflicts interweave.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes crystallize through "throne weighed by illusion" premise, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ink pellet acts autonomously during sundering, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens despite resonant deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: her decision to descend forecloses safety for truth, with conceptual cost crystallized in "remember the way back when the ocean was ready," though "summons" slightly tells rather than shows her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when rebellion’s "lull" reconfigures from stalemate to "gathering of breath," narrowing options to reignition. Cost is legible in "confidence welded to bone" and abandoned home, but escalation leans slightly on stone circle’s mystical intervention over pure protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when the guard appears—Nara must act within minutes, trading safety for epigenetic alteration. Cost is visceral (knees, time) and conceptual (council's ignorance), driven entirely by her agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reconstructing the beloved's face before collapse) tightens through Elian's agency: his tarot reassembly directly enables the mirror-door. Cost is unmistakable in "salt sealed his eyes" though visceral stakes could deepen earlier; escalation under Accumulative lens remains coherent with one meaningful deepening (fragments → truer fracture).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: his decision to empty the vial (vs. merely observing) forgoes safe tracking for temporal sacrifice. The cost—relinquishing anger for "conscious wildness"—is legible in his final transformation, narrowing options to a single irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Sera's agency: uploading via dormant networks (not coincidence) narrows options to "topple governances or ignite mobs," with cost legible in her whispered promise to burn with the books. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens via sensory escalation (hissing copper, snow-dusted histories), though the "tremor of guilt" moment slightly softens the trade-off's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    One tightening beat (grafting sandbag) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "refusing to let chaos break the thread," with agency driving the reconfiguration of "destruction into purposeful" growth.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten via goddess' threat ("burn the garden silent"), narrowing options to silence-as-weapon. Cost legible in draining emotional hues and starfire-warmed spike. Escalation barely meets "meaningful tightening" requirement; spike solution edges toward convenience without sufficient prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (each inscription deepens contradiction), narrowing options until the cage/reconfiguration; cost (shattered nib, transformed orbit) unmistakably legible on final page with aphelion's drift and inked sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by agency: selecting RESTORE reveals firmware truth, forcing RELEASE choice. Tightening forecloses translation path; cost (voice trade) unmistakable in "cultivated them, feeding on guilt." Accumulative density surge (letters → paper chain) reweights dominant stake (silencing guilt) with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (meaning in impermanence) signaled immediately via "chalk dust on tongue" and tightened through Mira’s agency: sprinkling tile dust triggers hush’s reconfiguration.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory deepening, though external conflict remains purely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake ("what mercy existed in choosing who deserved to remember?") escalates through Asha's realization about "aberrant mercy." Final map-building forecloses her isolation with visible cost: abandoning the plaza for years of teaching. Agency drives deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (luring possibility from despair) signaled early and deepened through echo-layering; cost legible in Lila's disappearance. Escalation via density increase qualifies under Accumulative lens but lacks visible tradeoffs in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes (privacy vs connection) tighten through sensory escalation, but pressure isn't driven by Maya's agency—she's compelled rather than choosing, undermining the "affectionate skeptic" arc's causal weight under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes crystallize early: speaking for vs. being spoken through the unknown. Escalation via fossil's heat inversion forces Aera's agency (pressing it, singing), narrowing options to dissolution. Cost is visceral—collapse, cheek on warm stone—and conceptually charges the legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (broken prophecy) deepens through button cataloging, but stakes remain abstract—lacking visceral testing of "world narrow to thread" consequences—until the final reconfiguration, weakening cost legibility during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserving narrative essence against silence) tightens meaningfully when gutters stop, forcing distillation; cost of identity loss is felt but not viscerally dramatized during the key thread-pulling beat under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Lin understands "places resist change when no one remembers how to tend kindness"; conceptual cost is unmistakable in covenant ("memory travels forward only when carried by kindness") driving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Mara opens the bolted door, but the boy's confinement lacks escalation beyond initial setup; cost is felt through petal dissolution yet remains slightly abstract without tangible consequence for him.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (isolation vs. community) escalates through accumulative density—hum’s rising intensity, shadow’s millimeter=year crawl. Agency culminates in henge choice where solitude trades memory for momentum, with cost made visceral in hoof-fall erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten when Mira recognizes her ghostwritten lines on the mirrors, narrowing options to either retreat or whisper her truth; the cost is unmistakable in "heart became a palimpsest" with felt conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (eroding trust) tightens through lunar eclipse deadline, with visible cost (Mara's permanent enmity). However, escalation relies on entities' convenient vulnerability during eclipse—a late rule change not grounded in prior causality, weakening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (key vs claustrophobia) tightens through spatial mutiny: rails bowing inward and starlight becoming a keyhole force Arin’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: mixing ribbon fibers into pigment narrows options to one irreversible act (lancing the heel), paying visible cost (water revealing mask); the dominant stake (awakening empathy) tightens through her methodical process, with gardenia scent deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.7)
    Stakes tighten when Mara’s question forces Voss’s stance crystallization; the cost (proving the journey worth remembering) is unmistakable in the helm-log discovery. Agency drives every escalation under the causal lens, narrowing options toward Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes signaled immediately via "single verdict of 'never'", escalating through violin-playing that "sculpts possibility" with tangible cost (grinding pixels into dust). Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens; hitchhiker's reconstruction forecloses "never" with conceptual price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (cyclical paths) tightens when narrator reinterprets markers as signatures, narrowing options to release money. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in "equally beautiful, equally worthless" realization; accumulative escalation lacks visceral pressure peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully as SS Lacertae's fade narrows options to "speak syllables or lose inscription," with cost crystallized in "the weight of every story swallowed." Temporal pressure ("before next variable star dimmed") isn't leveraged enough early to tighten escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Briar’s agency: her confession ("I let them die") narrows options by forcing acceptance of moral cost, with the seed’s truth-recognition providing visible escalation that reweights the dominant stake of stolen peace.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: pressing clipping against scar actively triggers the maze transition. Cost crystallizes when the hedge roots permanently in their palm—no soft reset. But the gardener's binary question ("prune or graft?") slightly oversimplifies the thematic nuance of "the green minute" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (patching soul holes) tightens through single, high-cost memory trade where agency forecloses path with visceral cost: "warmth exiting through the circle." Accumulative escalation reweights "holes" from leaks to light-channels without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: transcribing iron-leaf Morse reconfigures "haunted ambitions" from abstract grief to literal demand ("ambitions can be haunted... demand you finish").

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens: moon's pull narrows options as "call-numbers slide off pages," forcing librarian to smelt identities before contradictions scatter into "storms of forgetting," with visible cost in the hollow where tomorrow existed.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through paper boat act: "chronicle again... but the entries would begin with today."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes (time/language debt) escalate through visceral trade-offs: heartbeat arrives late, shadow lags, scream sucked into vacuum. Peak choice (seizing syllable-key) driven by agency under accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable when lullaby memory is swallowed and lie restored—no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through visceral pressure: orchids screaming, stems bowing under violin's gravity. Cost legible in transformed promise ("color of maybe"), though emperor's threat slightly abstract compared to garden's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.7)
    Dominant stake (capturing sparks before oblivion) deepens through protagonist's agency: realizing the spark is her own narrows options to surrender. Cost—"one life surrendered"—unmistakable on the page. Accumulative escalation via pattern density reweights stakes flawlessly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes tighten when wind shears path, but boy's dissipation relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency. Cost is conceptual (sealing lifeline) but "fermented forgiveness" sap resolution feels convenient; escalation lacks meaningful trade-off as caretaker simply stabs hairpin with no foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Mira's agency: her offer to "let the wind have" certainty narrows options to truth or self-deception, with felt cost in the geologist's fractured reflection of dying coral—escalation is driven by her choice, though the physical cost remains implied rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    No active conflict or agency—Marcus observes passively without trade-offs or tactical shifts. The dominant stake (understanding vanishing) is intellectual but lacks visceral pressure; no narrowing of options or earned stance crystallization beyond revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via Cael's song deepening the bone towers' resonance, but escalation lacks tangible cost beyond emotional weight; the "wandering pulse" resolution feels earned through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (sacred simplicity vs. algorithmic control) tighten meaningfully when the keystone’s "doorway" appears—Elian’s unstrapping bands narrows options to a binary choice. Cost is visible in the keystone’s "hairline fracture," but escalation leans atmospheric; the High Algorithm’s clicking feels observational rather than pressuring his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through density—lanterns to plankton to colored vows—with the archive’s fragility imposing visceral cost (one exhale collapses it). But the dominant stake ("color of sound") remains slightly abstract; survival urgency could sharpen the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation via Elara's agency: coin dissolution narrows options to becoming the static, with cost legible in "her atoms begin to distill." Dominant stake ("wavelength align with purpose") tightens as pulse fades, pressure crystallizing in the scream of Earth's coin.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by reaper's agency: shattering cylinders to release voices transforms abstract sacrifice into named fears that settle as a ledger. Cost is unmistakable when unlived years "stacked in his ribcage" alter his understanding of existence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake escalation via protagonist agency—doubt to decisive crystal dissolution—narrows options with unmistakable cost ("unravel the seam between knowable and known"). Single deepening (starling coordinates) suffices perfectly for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency as the stolen signal forces revision of trust, narrowing options to "drop it as a false clue" or descend. The dominant stake (trust vs. security) tightens through the instructor's impossible signal, with cost unmistakable in the physical/emotional weight shift of passing the buckle. No coincidence resolves tension; pressure coheres via Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (custody via emotional authenticity) signaled immediately. Escalation via confession rounds: each "pulse" deepens pressure as fluid glows. Zero's falter on "fearing love" narrows options. Cost unmistakable—"dissolve into narrative fog" becomes synthesis with "grief for selves lost." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single tightening forecloses resistance: Mira’s choice to guide growth (“fingers dancing over brass levers”) narrows options from fighting the seed to becoming “puzzle and planter.” Cost is visceral in the mill’s transformation (“doorways realigned into spirals”) and the brook’s unnatural flow, escalating organically under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (restoring laughter) tighten through agency: Ellery’s shift from roaring to "measured sighs" forecloses revival fantasy for earned connection. Cost is unmistakable in physical collapse and wife’s delayed chuckle—pressure coheres under accumulative lens via echo density reweighting absence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: licking sundial reconfigures "boundaries of light" from abstract to embodied cost. "To wait was not to pause but to attend" deepens conflict into irreversible stance crystallization with palpable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency—discarding assumptions narrows options visibly as fragment glows warmer; cost is unmistakable when sequin sublimation sacrifices "one lifetime of conclusions" to feed the circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten decisively when Arden realizes merging requires choosing which timeline to sacrifice ("burning hope through his coat"). Agency shines in reversing the hourglass flow, but the cost leans slightly abstract—more visceral embodiment of "pouring" one timeline into another would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake "discover texture of connection" tightens via weaving mechanics, culminating in earned renunciation (creator/creation duality lost); conceptual cost undeniable as composite man dissolves into "dandelion seeds" of relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully through pulse intensification and the women's convergence, but the single tightening lacks a visible price *shaping tactics*—the cost is resonant yet not actively altering choices mid-beat as high-band requires.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes deepen through Mara's agency: naming technicians narrows options (thinning gold fleck) while shifting from physical survival to memory-bearing. The tidal clock tightens tactics ("between one tide and the next"), making the conceptual cost of remembrance undeniable as claustrophobia "ebbs with the tide".

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (living with life’s fragility) deepens via ink-map realization; escalation through conceptual cost (frozen tears as "tiny observatory domes") but clerk encounter slightly simplifies tension.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (bitterness-to-levity transformation) tightens via mentor's static confession, foreclosing Vale's hunter identity with visible cost. Single deepening suffices: "laughter bending telephone wires" reweights options under Accumulative lens. Agency clear in "allowed arrowhead to guide," though herbalist's pressure lacks escalation beyond phone handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via musical skips that narrow statue options; cost visible in statues' irreversible rooting. Agency-driven escalation strong but one tightening slightly softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (silence as possibility) tightens through carpenter's agency: disbelief → physical interaction → singing with memory. Escalation via sensory deepening (wind bells to marrow-heard neighs) makes cost undeniable in the throat ache.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: entering the warped corridor tightens options through density increase (shorter steps covering more distance, titles rearranging), with cost unmistakable in the scarf's release of "overdue hours" and marginal notes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when Mireya steps into tide to paint a golden corridor, narrowing options to a single decisive frame—but escalation relies on atmospheric density rather than tactical cost, weakening the "fair bargain" trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (freeing peace) tightens meaningfully when the mouth trembles, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost. The locksmith's solution ("I've already seen you free") resolves tension without visible trade-off; agency feels passive against fear's resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes crystallize late: dominant conflict (memory vs. forgetting) tightens meaningfully at the sextant, but "habitual surrender" concept lacks early dramatization. Cost is undeniable in regained memories, yet escalation feels slightly delayed.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) escalates through accumulative pressure as hues gather and loom buckles; Arin's agency in redefining "succor" as sharing—not hoarding—carries undeniable cost in the collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stake ("grounding spirits") tightens via agency (unraveling knots); escalation culminates in the fox mask’s desperate yelp forcing the final choice; cost (vocation’s collapse) is unmistakable in the crumbling mask and hollow name.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via deepening: silence shifts from absence of birds to "accumulated silence" of sailors, narrowing options to empathetic listening; cost legible in sternum’s echo.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: measurements tighten to unscrewing the globe, narrowing options from analysis to release. Cost is unmistakable in the dog tags’ transfer and "background hum" realization under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten under accumulative lens: "before thunder rolls over them" becomes urgent when echo manifests, narrowing Lyra's option to faster encoding.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single dominant stake (joy beneath sorrow) deepens through Lira’s agency: trading thimble for coal ash shows tangible cost. Escalation via accumulating sensory pressure—cipher to musical staff to seed planting—reweights options under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative escalation: each filament reading ("Joy, 03:22... smells like rain on hot tarmac") reweights dominant stake as cable frays. Cost crystallizes in final image where Mara becomes part of transmitted memory.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten relentlessly under accumulative lens: siren wails narrow temporal option, vibrations force faster work, first explosion crystallizes stance. Her agency drives deepening—realizing she must paint negative space, then discovering she painted her own face—reweighting the dominant stake (preserving meaning) with undeniable cost: walking from the library as it implodes. Pressure coherent and escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Lira’s agency: dimming lights narrow options to language-as-fuel, with visceral cost (knees shaking, risk of rejection). The "stranded luminance" concept changes tactics, though the chief’s exposition slightly undermines accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Rowan’s agency: his realization about mirrored "drafts" forces the key-healing choice with visible cost (surrendering escape), but the singular tightening lacks a secondary pressure point to elevate beyond strong execution; lunar rhythm motif deepens the dominant repair stake effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: frost messages → pigment urgency → physical balancing. Cost is unmistakable in "Mara felt the tether loosen," but escalation lacks one visceral narrowing of options—e.g., a colonist's hesitation could heighten the "tilted sky" paradox's terror for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven entirely by her agency: each whispered lullaby iteration deepens the hush, narrowing options until the renunciation. Cost is unmistakable in the erosion imagery. Secondary stake (puppet’s forgiveness) slightly underserved in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single dominant stake (escape before frost) tightens through Accumulative escalation—frost "lapping grass blades" visibly raises cost; Mara’s agency drives deepening via nut-kernel handprint, with her continued imprisonment as undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.7)
    Dominant stake (transforming separation into connection) signaled by paragraph 1; single deepening (river foam insight) narrows options to resin solution with felt cost (trembling knees, tears). Pressure tightens through Mara’s agency—no coincidence resolves grief.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation via Accumulative density: each transaction deepens the orchard's weight until "floorplate dip"; cost is unmistakable in vendor's self-erasure, driven entirely by her agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Marisol's agency: her decision to "pour her own memories" into the coral reconfigures the dominant conflict (human vs. geological grief) with felt cost (altered gift). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as emotional contagion forces a single, decisive deepening that forecloses forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate via Mireya’s language-braiding vigil—pressure tightens as silence "ached like a missing rib" to the elevator’s demand "Build me a bridge"—but the single deepening lacks a visible price paid *during* escalation; cost manifests only at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (extract dreams intact) tightens via protagonist agency: her calibration forecloses safety, trading motor control for resonance. Cost is tripartite—physical (blood), emotional (fading voices), tactical (engines to dust)—made unmistakable when "mirrors burned out" yet pockets sag with moonlight gears.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten relentlessly under Accumulative lens: inversion’s hour creates live clock ("gravity returns to normal" deadline), narrowing options to consumption, librarianship, or the "third option."

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (silent world vs music) escalate through Ilay's agency: mapping cracks to melody narrows options to the final arpeggio, with visceral cost (trembling knees, redefined reality) unmistakable when she "hears for the first time... conversation—tree to bird to soil."

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (exile's meaning) tightens through protagonist's intellectual agency in correlating silence, but "before next phase" timeframe remains vague rather than a live clock altering tactics, losing escalation precision under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Mirelle's agency: naming silences ("Absence, Hesitation, Shame") deepens knowledge until final frequency forces the cost of becoming "its echo." Fireworks' approach tightens time pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (perfect graft timing) escalates through sensory precision; cost of relinquished ambition ("meant to astonish... village astonished her") is legible when seed's early bloom shifts her goal. Tide reversal tightens temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten via gravity inversion’s live clock ("hour was only minutes away"), forcing branch-to-branch leaps. Cost crystallizes when memories flow outward—a visible forfeiture altering her state. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (arrow discovery) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: each wind reading narrows options until the spiral's collapse forces escape. Cost is unmistakable in "containers falling" and "town gone silent," reweighting stakes through lived experience not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate through live clock ("if before/after" timing), but "shackled to utility" remains slightly abstract; pressure tightens via protagonist's wrist-angle choice with felt cost (cracked bell).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Kaelen’s agency: shifting from playing to breathing through the flute narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in "silence paid in advance" and the flute’s final claiming by quiet, though the ash-wind backstory’s impact feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Quince’s agency: borrowing astronomer’s logic intensifies widow’s grief collision, narrowing options to press reversal; cost is legible in weightless heart but "hunger for pattern/presence" phrasing slightly over-articulates the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens: "world that preferred certainty to mystery" vs. coaxing wonder. Elias's agency in releasing the pendant forecloses ordinary existence, with cost legible in "weight of becoming"—a transformation narrowing options through internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes viscerally tighten via prism's reactions: warmth rejects "I have let you go," flaring rejects "You were not afraid," while "I need you still" earns the fracture. Cost is undeniable—hairline crack in prism/himself, frost evaporating her initials. Textural escalation perfectly aligns with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes remain abstract ("impossible distance"); escalation lacks protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Cost (voice loss) is felt but pressure doesn't tighten—revelation outweighs struggle in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when lift jams "between starlight above and furnace glow below," forcing Corin’s cable-cutting agency. Cost is visceral: magicians lose sky-high hold, citizens’ fear transforms to resilience. Single escalation suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation via deepening knowledge (crater bay → zero-g locker) narrows options to single path of revelation; cost unmistakable in "maps sold to militaries funded the cover-up" with tactical shift to redirect commissions.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes crystallize around preserving connection against forgetting; lamp’s double death escalates pressure under Accumulative lens. Elias’s agency shines in stacking the fourth stone and bottling glass—tactics narrowing to ritual endurance. Cost is felt in widow’s cove stone and keeper’s potential fall.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (shaping dawn via shadows) tightens through Lirael's laughter agency, but the cost of erasing stars remains abstract; "granite blocks groaned" provides physical consequence yet lacks emotional weight scaling to closure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen from intellectual curiosity to embodied cost ("terror and tenderness") through Kael’s agency; sun-trail tracking narrows options with visible price in the bridge vision’s heart stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: dream-capturing beads lower "ambient sorrow by measurable milligrams," tightening pressure through density increase. The refracted spectral trees force Mara’s decisive choice to deconstruct the sextant, with visible cost in the brass "softening into living wood" as she speaks memories.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes (songs as dawn’s loom) tighten decisively when night coagulates into tarry vines attacking the mica. Keeper’s agency drives escalation—altering lullaby into invitation forecloses solo singing with visceral cost (shards in ribs). Cost unmistakable: blood becomes new lens, memories bleed as silver dust.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (correcting past mistake) tightens through Vale’s approach; Elara’s kneeling choice forecloses escape with felt cost; "bring the gift of absence" deepens into conceptual trap; escalation driven by protagonist’s surrender, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mila’s planting agency—each buried loaf narrows options as "commuters stepped around them without seeing"; cost crystallizes when ordinary bread tastes of "sacred continuous" with salted tears.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens deepens when library archives her footprints mid-measurement, tightening the stake (preserving meaning vs. being consumed by archive) with cost legible in halted chronometer and shelving slide under "Possibility—unmeasured."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through sensory density (ring pulsing, forests humming), narrowing Mira's options toward understanding. But the dominant conflict (skepticism vs belief) lacks visceral testing—her "why" motivation resolves through revelation rather than earned trade-offs, softening the cost of transformed perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by agency: her shift from "rectify the ruin" to collaborative drawing narrows options, with visceral cost in "strokes that cracked her nails."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (truth vs. performative speech) tighten through Lira’s vulnerable admissions at junctions, narrowing options to emotional exposure. Cost is unmistakable in final image, though "tomorrow’s date" slightly softens urgency; agency shines as candor literally brightens her path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: comet deadline forces final calibration under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable—"iceberg shrinking to a pearl" while sculpture’s glow persists—reconfiguring options as physical memory fades but resonance endures. One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by K-17’s agency under Accumulative lens: magnetic shifts narrow options, box’s resistance to miniaturization forces stance crystallization.

Live clock ("grew heavier with each passing hour") tightens tactics, culminating in earned trade-off between order and memory preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: following locket’s echo, then sitting without tools. Cost is visceral—her renunciation of transactional solutions ("not to sell but to display"). Conflict resolves cleanly under accumulative lens, though the shift from rattling to quiet feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (decode before web completes) tightens through Mara's agency (dice roll, arabesque), narrowing options with visible cost ("lab shuddered"); accumulative escalation reweights vulnerability as strength.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    Single dominant stake (reclaiming erased memories) tightens via gravity surges that force micro-choices: feeding matchbook to stabilize projection. Visible cost in flame distortion and petal disintegration, narrowing options toward Earned Stasis (lighting buoys without full restoration).

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake (hushing prophecy) tightens through protagonist agency: mapping silence narrows options, swallowing the sphere pays visible cost. Escalation via cricket-leg drumbeat and "tasted copper" intensifies pressure cleanly under Accumulative lens. No redundant loops.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Mara’s escalating sensory sacrifice: "each syllable cost a color" transforms abstract memory quarantine into visceral trade-off where vision loss forges the garden’s public archive with undeniable conceptual cost.

    Stakes escalate through Mara’s realization that "calibrated treason" corrupted her soul, narrowing options to self-forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when echo questions Lira, narrowing options to descent. But escalation relies on revelation (mother's words) over agency; cost is felt yet not fully earned through her choices, missing high-band escalation guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stake escalation driven purely by Marrow’s agency—analyzing cameos, entering shrine, following jellyfish memories—with cost crystallized in her "first unguarded expression." Pressure tightens via her tactile choices under ice, though the glacier’s demands could feel more actively antagonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding hidden effort) tightens through pattern density: moon paths fade but never disappear → shadow staircase emerges. Cloud crossing moon forces action in darkness, raising cost. Final step onto "absence" forecloses solid ground with felt conceptual price: becoming the invisible force that "maintains the world while others sleep."

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Marisol’s agency: reassembling letters deepens knowledge, the playback forces confrontation with shame, and hanging the diamond pays a visible cost (orchard decay) under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory vs. prophet's forgetting) is signaled early and deepens through Elara's realization she must preserve, not stop.

Cost is conceptual (weight of memory) but unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving vanishing voices) tightens through Posy's agency: trapping the child's voice forces her to confront missing recordings, escalating to the music box's opening.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate through sonic density (micro-shrieks to calving ice), but the shadow-resolution lacks setup—why would "hungry" entities suddenly heed the third path? Cost is legible in the key's transformation, yet the town's unscathed survival undercuts pressure's final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes deepen through Elian's agency (tracking moon paths to pinpoint revolution's start), with felt cost in transformed impatience and irreversible coastal change. Human-scale revolution avoids telescopic stakes but could heighten visceral consequences of "unyoking."

    Stakes tighten when Emil reveals Rowan's evidence list—a meaningful deepening narrowing options—driven by his agency under accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost (systemic injustice).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten causally: Algorithm's "Descend" forces descent into corrosive danger, then missing clapper demands conceptual pivot. Juniper's agency drives escalation—her transliteration redefines the bell's purpose. Cost is unmistakable: the sound alters her perception permanently ("rang with a frequency no one else could yet detect").

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten causally: from noticing #Aurora73 to life-or-career choice at Block 73. Agency drives escalation—her lie to security and palm-press narrow options irreversibly. Cost legible in "employee file flickered... pixelating into static," scaling perfectly to length. Coincidence (hashtag auto-complete) complicates but never resolves; pressure remains protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes narrow meaningfully when the ice crack forces Kael’s decisive "north by northeast" command. The two futures vision deepens internal/external conflict, but Sira’s net discovery risks coincidental resolution without earlier foreshadowing of the abandoned gear.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Mara’s agency under Accumulative lens: listening role deepens to offering tea, narrowing options toward the gangway climax. Cost is unmistakable in "the approaching ending lost its teeth," though the boy’s arrival edges on coincidence without sufficient prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through archivist’s ritual: transmuting pain requires precise photo arcs, narrowing options until the dove emerges. Cost is legible in her labor ("tweezers finer than eyelashes"), but escalation lacks a live option foreclosure—pressure builds cleanly yet without a palpable trade-off that tests her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes ("decode silence before language dies") escalate through protagonist-driven testimony triggering the book fall. Cost unmistakable in the "sad smile" at "zygote"—a conceptual forfeiture of linguistic finality. Pressure tightens via sequence accumulation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure as fog thickens and tape spools, but the single tightening (finding recorder) lacks visible tactical cost; conceptual cost is undeniable though physical stakes remain underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: "harness the ephemeral" evolves from abstract desire to concrete action when she sets the Hasselblad inward, foreclosing her constant orbit. Cost is unmistakable in the observatory’s collapse into the photograph, though "escape velocity" remains thematic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
